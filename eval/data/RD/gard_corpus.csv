"Summary of GRACILE syndrome: GRACILE syndrome is an inherited metabolic disease. GRACILE stands for growth retardation, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, iron overload, lactacidosis, and early death. Infants are very small at birth and quickly develop complications. During the first days of life, infants will develop a buildup of lactic acid in the bloodstream (lactic acidosis) and amino acids in the urine (aminoaciduria). They will also have problems with the flow of bile from the liver (cholestasis) and too much iron in their blood. Affected individuals aren't typically born with unique physical features. GRACILE syndrome is caused by a genetic change in the BCS1L gene, and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The BCS1L gene provides instructions needed by the mitochondria in cells to help produce energy."
"Summary of Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome: Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome is genetic disorder characterized by absent eyelids (ablepharon) and very large mouth (macrostomia). Other common signs and symptoms include abnormal external ears, fusion (syndactyly) of the hands and feet, skin findings (such as dry and coarse skin or redundant folds of skin), absent or sparse hair, genital malformations, and developmental delay. Other reported findings include underdeveloped cheeks (malar hypoplasia), absent or very small (hypoplastic) nipples, umbilical abnormalities and growth retardation. It belongs to a group of diseases called ectodermal dysplasias (genetic disorders that involve defects in the skin, hair, nails, sweat glands, and/or teeth). Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the TWIST2 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, but most cases are sporadic (when there are no other cases in the family). Genetic changes in TWIST2 gene also cause the Barber Say syndrome and Setleis syndrome, other ectodermal dysplasia syndromes which have very similar features."
Summary of Acanthocheilonemiasis: A parasitic infection caused by genus of filarial worms called Dipetalonema. It produces microfilariae in the blood and body fluids.
"Summary of Acromesomelic dysplasia: Acromesomelic dysplasia describes a group of extremely rare, inherited, progressive skeletal conditions that result in a particular form of short stature, called short-limb dwarfism. The short stature is the result of unusually short forearms and forelegs (mesomelia) and abnormal shortening of the bones in the hands and feet (acromelia). At birth, the hands and feet may appear abnormally short and broad. Over time, the apparent disproportion becomes even more obvious, especially during the first years of life. Additional features may include: limited extension of the elbows and arms; progressive abnormal curvature of the spine; an enlarged head; and a slightly flattened midface. Acromesomelic dysplasia is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. There are different types of Acromesomelic dysplasia, which are distinguished by their genetic cause."
"Summary of Acromicric dysplasia: Acromicric dysplasia affects the growth and development of the bones. Signs and symptoms include short stature, short hands and feet, and distinctive facial features. Overtime, people with Acromicric dysplasia may develop limited joint movement and hip dislocations. Acromicric dysplasia does not affect intelligence or learning. Acromicric dysplasia is caused by genetic variants in the FBN1 gene or the LTBP3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and imaging studies. Diagnosis may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Agnosia: Agnosia is characterized by an inability to recognize and identify objects and/or persons. Symptoms may vary, according to the area of the brain that is affected. It can be limited to one sensory modality such as vision or hearing; for example, a person may have difficulty in recognizing an object as a cup or identifying a sound as a cough. Agnosia can result from strokes, traumatic brain injury, dementia, a tumor, developmental disorders, overexposure to environmental toxins (e.g., carbon monoxide poisoning), or other neurological conditions. Visual Agnosia may also occur in association with other underlying disorders. People with Agnosia may retain their cognitive abilities in other areas."
"Summary of Alternating hemiplegia of childhood: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a neurological disorder that usually affects children before 18 months of age. Classic AHC causes recurrent episodes of paralysis (hemiplegia) that involve one or both sides of the body, multiple limbs, or a single limb. The paralysis may affect different parts of the body at different times and may be brief or last for several days. A characteristic feature of AHC is that symptoms disappear during sleep and return upon waking. Many affected children display some degree of developmental delay, abnormal eye (oculomotor) movements, uncontrolled limb movements (including ataxia, dystonia, and choreoathetosis) and seizures. The majority of cases of AHC are caused by a new change (called a pathogenic variant) in the ATP1A3 gene that is not inherited. Thus, most patients with AHC do not have a family history of the disorder. A small number of cases of AHC are caused by changes in the ATP1A2 gene. When this condition does run in families, it follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
Summary of Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a pulmonary disease with symptoms of dyspnea and cough resulting from the inhalation of an antigen to which the subject has been previously sensitized.
"Summary of Aniridia-cerebellar ataxia-intellectual disability syndrome: A rare, congenital, neurological disorder characterized by the association of partial bilateral aniridia with non-progressive cerebellar ataxia, and intellectual disability."
"Summary of Ocular motor apraxia, Cogan type: Oculomotor apraxia Cogan type (COMA) is an eye condition characterized by a defect in side-to-side (horizontal) eye movements. Because of this, most patients with COMA have to turn their head in order to follow objects in side gaze. Typically, up-to-down (vertical) eye movements are unaffected. COMA can also be associated with mild developmental delay and speech difficulties. Individuals with COMA may also have kidney disorders and underdevelopment of the part of cerebellum that separates the left and right hemisphere of the brain (cerebellar vermis). When other symptoms occur, COMA may be a symptom of other disorders, such as nephronophthisis or Joubert syndrome. In many instances, the cause of COMA is not known. Cases support an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern."
"Summary of Arachnoid cyst: Arachnoid cysts are sacs filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are located between the brain or spinal cord and the arachnoid membrane, one of the three membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Arachnoid cysts can be primary or secondary. Primary Arachnoid cysts are congenital (present at birth), resulting from abnormal development of the brain and spinal cord during early pregnancy. Secondary Arachnoid cysts are less common, and result from head injuries, meningitis, tumors, or as a complication of brain surgery. Signs and symptoms depend on the location and size of the cyst and may include headache, nausea and vomiting, seizures, hearing and visual disturbances, vertigo, and difficulties with balance and walking. Although many affected individuals develop symptoms in the first year of life, some never develop symptoms. In some cases, Arachnoid cysts are part of a genetic syndrome such as Chudley-McCullough syndrome, mucopolysaccharidosis, or Marfan syndrome, where there are many other associated signs and symptoms."
"Summary of Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency: Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency is a condition in which the body cannot break down the nucleotides, thymine and uracil. The severity of DPD deficiency can vary.  Most people have no obvious signs or symptoms, but some develop serious neurological problems as infants. In infants with severe DPD deficiency, the signs and symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, microcephaly, increased muscle tone (hypertonia), delayed motor skills, and autistic behavior. It is not clear why some individuals with DPD deficiency have symptoms and others don't. DPD deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the DPYD gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Babies with the severe form of DPD deficiency may be diagnosed based on the symptoms and additional laboratory testing. Individuals with the DPD deficiency, regardless of the presence or severity of symptoms, are at risk for severe, toxic reactions to drugs called fluoropyrimidines which are used to treat cancer. Individuals with no symptoms may be diagnosed only by laboratory testing or after exposure to fluoropyrimidines."
Summary of Björnstad syndrome: BjÃ¶rnstad syndrome is characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and pili torti.
"Summary of Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a complex eyelid malformation present at birth. It is characterized by four major features. BPES causes blepharophimosis (narrowing of the eye opening). BPES causes ptosis (drooping eyelids). BPES causes epicanthus inversus (an extra fold of skin near the inner corner of the eye). BPES causes telecanthus (increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes). BPES type I includes those four major features and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). POI is early loss of ovarian function that can lead to difficulty conceiving. BPES type II includes only the four major features. Other symptoms that may be present include lacrimal (tear) duct anomalies, and amblyopia (lazy eye). Symptoms also include strabismus (crossed eyes), and refractive errors (trouble seeing near or far). Minor features include a broad nasal bridge, low-set ears, and a short philtrum (the space between the nose and upper lip). BPES is caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene."
"Summary of Cat-eye syndrome: Cat eye syndrome is a chromosome abnormality that affects many different parts of the body. The signs and symptoms of the condition vary widely but may include abnormalities of the eyes, ears, anal region, heart, and/or kidney. In people affected by Cat eye syndrome, each cell has at least one small extra (duplicate) chromosome made up of genetic material from chromosome 22. This extra genetic material leads to the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition. Most cases of Cat eye syndrome occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Cat-scratch disease: Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lymph nodes. It is typically caused by the bacteria bartonella (Bartonella henselae). It is usually transmitted by being scratched or bitten by a cat, but rarely, no scratch or bite is involved. Symptoms frequently include the formation of a small bump at the site of the scratch or bite, followed by fever and swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) within 1-3 weeks. People with weakened immune systems (and less commonly, people with healthy immune systems) may develop more widespread disease and additional symptoms or neurological complications, which can be severe. In most cases, particularly in children and adolescents, having CSD once means that it cannot occur again."
"Summary of Catel-Manzke syndrome: Catel-Manzke syndrome is a rare bone disease characterized by bilateral hyperphalangy and clinodactyly of the index finger typically in association with Pierre Robin sequence (see this term) comprising micrognathia, cleft palate and glossoptosis."
"Summary of CHARGE syndrome: CHARGE syndrome is a congenital condition (present from birth) that affects many areas of the body. CHARGE stands for coloboma, heart defect, atresia choanae (also known as choanal atresia), restricted growth and development, genital abnormality, and ear abnormality. Signs and symptoms vary among people with this condition; however, infants often have multiple medical conditions. The diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome is based on a combination of major and minor characteristics. In more than half of all cases, genetic changes in the CHD7 gene cause CHARGE syndrome. When caused by a genetic change in the CHD7 gene, it can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern; although most cases result from new (de novo) genetic changes in the gene and occur in people with no history of the condition in their family."
Summary of Cholecystitis: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Serpiginous choroiditis: Affected individuals have lesions in the eye that last from weeks to months and involve scarring of the eye tissue. Recurrence of these lesions is common in Serpiginous choroiditis. Vision loss may occur in one or both eyes when the macula is involved.
"Summary of Tetrasomy 18p: Chromosome 18p tetrasomy is a chromosomal disorder that affects many parts of the body. It occurs when the short arm of chromosome 18 (18p) appears four times (tetrasomy) rather than the normal two times in cells of the body. The symptoms of chromosomy 18p tetrasomy vary from case to case but may include abnormalities of the head and face (craniofacial) area, malformations of the spine, hands, and/or feet, neuromuscular abnormalities, kidney malformations, intellectual disability, speech delays, and behavioral abnormalities. In most cases, Chromosome 18p tetrasomy is the result of a spontaneous (de novo) genetic change early in fetal development during pregnancy."
"Summary of Partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3: Chromosome 3p partial deletion is a chromosome abnormality that affects many different parts of the body. People with this condition are missing genetic material located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 3 in each cell. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary based on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Most cases are not inherited, although affected people can pass the deletion on to their children."
Summary of WT limb-blood syndrome: A rare constitutional aplastic anemia disorder characterized by severe hypo/aplastic anemia or pancytopenia associated with skeletal anomalies (such as radial/ulnar defects and hand/digit abnormalities) and an increased risk of leukemia.

"Summary of Mosaic trisomy 9: Mosaic trisomy 9 is a chromosomal abnormality that can affect may parts of the body. In people affected by this condition, some of the body's cells have three copies of chromosome 9 (trisomy), while other cells have the usual two copies of this chromosome. The signs and symptoms vary but may include mild to severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, growth problems (both before and after birth), congenital heart defects, and/or abnormalities of the craniofacial (skull and face) region. Most cases are not inherited; it often occurs sporadically as a random event during the formation of the reproductive cells (egg and sperm) or as the fertilized egg divides."
"Summary of Haim-Munk syndrome: Haim-Munk syndrome (HMS) is characterized by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, severe early-onset periodontitis, onychogryposis, pes planus, arachnodactyly and acroosteolysis."
"Summary of Congenital varicella syndrome: Congenital varicella syndrome is an extremely rare disorder in which affected infants have distinctive abnormalities at birth due to the mother's infection with chickenpox (maternal varicella zoster) early during pregnancy (i.e., up to 20 weeks gestation). Affected newborns may have a low birth weight and characteristic abnormalities of the skin, brain, eyes, the arms, legs, hands, and/or feet, and/or, in rare cases, other areas of the body. The range and severity of associated symptoms and physical findings may vary greatly from case to case depending upon when maternal varicella zoster infection occurred during fetal development."
"Summary of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1: Crigler Najjar syndrome, type 1 is an inherited disorder in which bilirubin, a substance made by the liver, cannot be broken down. This condition occurs when the enzyme that normally converts bilirubin into a form that can easily be removed from the body does not work correctly. Without this enzyme, bilirubin can build up in the body and lead to jaundice and damage to the brain, muscles, and nerves. Crigler Najjar syndrome, type 1 is caused by genetic changes in the UGT1A1 gene. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Isolated cytochrome C oxidase deficiency: Cytochrome c oxidase deficiency (COX deficiency) is a condition that can affect several parts of the body including the skeletal muscles, heart, brain, and liver. There are four types of COX deficiency differentiated by symptoms and age of onset: benign infantile mitochondrial type, French-Canadian type, infantile mitochondrial myopathy type, and Leigh syndrome. The range and severity of signs and symptoms can vary widely among affected individuals (even within the same subtype and same family) and depend on the form of the condition present. Features in mildly affected individuals may include muscle weakness and hypotonia; in more severely affected individuals, brain dysfunction; heart problems; an enlarged liver; lactic acidosis; and/or a specific group of features known as Leigh syndrome may also be present. COX deficiency is caused by genetic changes in any of at least 14 genes; the inheritance pattern depends on the gene involved."
"Summary of De Barsy syndrome: De Barsy syndrome is a rare genetic disorder originally described in 1968 and classified as a form of cutis laxa. Cutis laxa is characterized by skin that is loose (lax), wrinkled, sagging, and lacking elasticity. The specific symptoms and the severity of De Barsy syndrome can vary greatly. Features that may be seen include eye abnormalities, growth abnormalities, and a prematurely-aged appearance. Distinctive facial features, skeletal malformations, and neurological abnormalities may also occur.  Some cases of De Barsy syndrome have been linked to genetic changes in either the PYCR1 or ALDH18A1 genes. De Barsy syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Duodenal atresia: A rare, non-syndromic intestinal malformation characterized by a complete but short segment obliteration of the duodenal lumen."

"Summary of Iridocorneal endothelial syndrome: Iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome describes a group of eye diseases that are characterized by three main features: Visible changes in the iris (the colored part of the eye that regulates the amount of light entering the eye)       Swelling of the cornea, and       The development of glaucoma (a disease that can cause severe vision loss when normal fluid inside the eye cannot drain properly)   ICE syndrome, is more common in women than men and is usually present in only one eye. The condition is actually a grouping of three closely linked conditions: Cogan-Reese syndrome; Chandler's syndrome; and essential (progressive) iris atrophy. The cause of ICE syndrome is unknown, however there is a theory that it is triggered by a virus that leads to swelling of the cornea."
"Summary of Femoral-facial syndrome: Femoral facial syndrome (FFS) is a rare condition characterized by underdevelopment of the thigh bone (femoral hypoplasia) and characteristic facial features. Facial features may include upward-slanting eyes, short nose with a broad tip, long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum), thin upper lip, small lower jaw (micrognathia), and cleft palate. Other features of FFS may include defects of the spinal bones (vertebrae), extra fingers or toes (polydactyly), ear defects, genitourinary abnormalities, underdeveloped lungs, abnormal kidney development, and patent ductus arteriosus. Intellectual development typically is normal. The cause of FFS typically is not known, although genetic factors are thought to play a role. One case has been associated with a chromosome abnormality. Some cases have been reported in association with diabetes in the mother during pregnancy. Familial cases have rarely been described."
"Summary of Filippi syndrome: Filippi syndrome is present at birth and impacts the development of the head, face, and limbs. Signs and symptoms include a small head (microcephaly), webbing of the fingers and toes (syndactyly), intellectual disability, growth delay, and distinctive facial features (high and broad nasal bridge, thin nostrils, small chin or micrognathia, and a high frontal hairline). Other features may can include vision problems, extra fingers and toes, and seizures. Because Filippi syndrome is very rare, it is not known how this condition changes over time. Filippi syndrome is caused by a genetic variant in the CKAP2L gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Fountain syndrome: Fountain syndrome is an extremely rare multi-systemic genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, deafness, skeletal abnormalities and coarse facial features."

Summary of Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Human monocytic ehrlichiosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome: Hyper IgM syndrome is a type of primary immunodeficiency syndrome. Primary immunodeficiency occurs when part of a personâs immune system is missing or does not work correctly. The bodies of people with primary immunodeficiency canât get rid of germs or protect themselves from new germs as well as they should. Primary immunodeficiencies are inherited, meaning they are passed down from parents to children. Hyper IgM syndromes are characterized by normal or elevated serum immunoglobulin M levels with absence of immunoglobulin G, A, and E. Immunoglobulins are proteins found in the blood. Hyper IgM results in a susceptibility to bacterial infections and sometimes opportunistic infections. There are five different types of hyper IgM syndromes (types 1-5). The types are distinguished by the location of the genetic change involved."
"Summary of Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia: Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is a genetic skin disease. Common symptoms include sparse scalp and body hair, reduced ability to sweat, and missing teeth. HED is caused by genetic changes in the EDA, EDAR, or EDARADD genes. It may be inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant manner depending on the genetic cause of the condition. The X-linked form is the most common form. The forms have similar signs and symptoms, however the the autosomal dominant form tends to be the mildest."

In some cases, decreased muscle tone, seizures, and delayed bone age may occur."
"Summary of KBG syndrome: KBG syndrome is a rare condition characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and intellectual disability. Specific signs and symptoms may include delayed bone age; abnormalities of the bones of the spine, ribs, and/or hands; large teeth (macrodontia); short stature; developmental delay; and behavioral or emotional issues. Less common features may include hearing loss, seizures, and congenital heart defects. In some cases, KBG syndrome is caused by a genetic change in the ANKRD11 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In other cases, the genetic cause is unclear. Some affected people inherit the condition from a parent, while in other people it occurs sporadically."
"Summary of Autosomal dominant Kenny-Caffey syndrome: Autosomal dominant Kenny-Caffey syndrome (Kenny-Caffey syndrome type 2) is a genetic disorder that affects the skeleton, head, and eyes.

"Summary of Lipodystrophy, congenital generalized, type 1: Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL), also known as Berardinelli-Seip syndrome, is a rare genetic disease that affects how the body stores fat. People with CGL have very little fat from birth or early infancy, and their bodies have trouble using insulin properly. This can lead to high blood sugar levels and diabetes. Other symptoms of CGL include dark, thickened patches of skin, enlarged liver, and high levels of triglycerides in the blood. CGL type 1 is caused by changes in the AGPAT2 gene. This gene plays a role in how the body processes fat. CGL type 1 follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Thanatophoric dysplasia: Thanatophoric dysplasia is a severe skeletal disorder characterized by extremely short limbs and folds of extra skin on the arms and legs. Other features of this condition include a narrow chest, short ribs, underdeveloped lungs, and an enlarged head with a large forehead and prominent, wide-spaced eyes. Thanatophoric dysplasia is caused by genetic changes in the FGFR3 gene. While this condition is considered to be autosomal dominant, virtually all cases have occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Two major forms of Thanatophoric dysplasia have been described, type I and type II. Type I Thanatophoric dysplasia is distinguished by the presence of curved thigh bones and flattened bones of the spine (platyspondyly). Type II Thanatophoric dysplasia is characterized by straight thigh bones and a moderate to severe skull abnormality called a cloverleaf skull."
"Summary of Chudley-McCullough syndrome: Chudley-McCullough syndrome is a rare, genetic, syndromic deafness characterized by severe to profound, bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss (congenital or rapidly progressive in infancy) associated with a complex brain malformation including hydrocephalus, varying degrees of partial corpus callosum agenesis, colpocephaly, cerebral and cerebellar cortical dysplasia (bilateral medial frontal polymicrogyria, bilateral frontal subcortical heteropia) and, in some, arachnoid cysts. Major physical abnormalities or psychomotor delay are usually not associated."
"Summary of Microphthalmia, Lenz type: Lenz microphthalmia syndrome is one of a group of genetic disorders known as syndromic microphthalmia. These conditions involve abnormal development of the eyes and several other parts of the body. Eye symptoms may include underdeveloped (small) or absent eyes, clouding of the lens (cataracts), uncontrolled eye movements (nystagmus), a gap or split in structures that make up the eye (coloboma), and glaucoma. These symptoms may affect one or both eyes and may cause vision loss or blindness. Other signs and symptoms may include abnormalities of the ears, teeth, hands, skeleton, urinary system, brain, and heart. Around 60% of people with this condition have delayed development or intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe. There are at least 10 different types of syndromic microphthalmia that are caused by genetic changes in different genes. Most cases of Lenz microphthalmia are caused by genetic changes of the BCOR gene and are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Other forms of syndromic microphthalmia are inherited in different patterns depending on the gene involved."

"Summary of Monilethrix: Monilethrix is a rare condition caused by a defect in the hair shaft resulting in hair which appears dry, dull, and brittle, and which breaks spontaneously or with mild trauma. The severity and course may vary from person to person."
"Summary of Mucolipidosis type IV: Mucolipidosis type 4 is a metabolic condition that affects the body's ability to process certain carbohydrates and fats. As a result, these materials accumulate in cells leading to the various signs and symptoms of the condition. Most people with Mucolipidosis type 4 develop severe psychomotor (mental and motor skills) delay and visual impairment.   Other common features of the condition include limited or absent speech; intellectual disability; hypotonia that gradually progresses to spasticity; problems controlling hand movements; impaired production of stomach acids; and iron deficiency. Approximately 5% of affected people have a mild form of the condition (known as atypical Mucolipidosis type 4) which is associated with milder psychomotor delay and less severe eye abnormalities. Mucolipidosis type 4 is caused by changes in the MCOLN1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Mulibrey nanism: Mulibrey Nanism is a rare genetic disorder characterized by profound growth delays and distinctive abnormalities of the muscles, liver, brain, and eyes. The acronym MULIBREY stands for (MU)scle, (LI)ver, (BR)ain, and (EY)e; nanism is another word for dwarfism. Signs and symptoms of the disorder may include constrictive pericarditis; low birth weight; short stature; severe progressive growth delays; hypotonia; hepatomegaly; and yellow discoloration of the eyes in infancy. It is caused by genetic changes in the TRIM37 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

There are three main forms of the condition that are differentiated by their pattern of inheritance:    X-linked Myotubular Myopathy   Autosomal Dominant Centronuclear myopathy   Autosomal Recessive Centronuclear myopathy   The cause of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary by subtype."
"Summary of Neu-Laxova syndrome: Neu Laxova syndrome (NLS) is a genetic disorder affecting many parts of the body. Babies born with NLS usually grow poorly during pregnancy (intrauterine growth restriction). At birth, they may be small (low birth weight and short in length) and their facial features are usually different and distinct. The babies may have a small head (microcephaly), sloping forehead, and widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism). Babies with NLS may also have extra fluid (edema) in their hands and feet, brain abnormalities, and rigid, stiff muscles. Other birth defects may affect the baby's arms, legs, skin, genitals, kidneys, and heart. Not every baby with NLS will have every sign or symptom of NLS. Neu Laxova syndrome (NLS) is caused by changess in one of three different genes, PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH. The genetic changes cause too little L-serine (an amino acid) to be made. There must be a genetic change in both copies of one of these genes, which means NLS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. NLS can be diagnosed both prenatally by an ultrasound or after birth. The diagnosis is suspected by signs and symptoms, but may be confirmed by genetic testing (prenatally by chorionic villi sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis; after birth by genetic blood test)."
"Summary of Ochoa syndrome: Ochoa syndrome is a very rare condition that causes unusual facial expressions and problems with urination. People with this condition have a characteristic frown-like facial expression when they try to smile or laugh, often described as ""inversion"" of facial expression. Urinary tract problems may include the inability to control urination (incontinence), inability to completely empty the bladder, and the buildup of urine in the kidneys (hydronephrosis). These problems often start in early childhood or adolescence and may lead to eventual kidney failure. Other signs and symptoms may include constipation, loss of bowel control and/or muscle spasms of the anus. Ochoa syndrome can be caused by a non-working HPSE2 or LRIG2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It can be diagnosed based on the symptoms."
"Summary of Oculocerebral hypopigmentation syndrome, Cross type: Oculocerebral hypopigmentation syndrome, Cross type is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by cutaneous and ocular hypopigmentation, various ocular anomalies (e.g. corneal and lens opacity, spastic ectropium, and/or nystagmus), growth deficiency, intellectual deficit and other progressive neurologic anomalies such as spastic tetraplegia, hyperreflexia, and/or athetoid movements. The clinical picture varies among patients and may also include other anomalies such as urinary tract abnormalities, Dandy-Walker malformations, and/or bilateral inguinal hernia."
"Summary of Oculocerebrocutaneous syndrome: Oculocerebrocutaneous (OCC) syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized primarily by eye, skin, and brain malformations. It has been described mostly in males. Findings in affected individuals may include orbital cysts, areas of underdeveloped (hypoplastic) or absent (aplastic) skin, and underdevelopment (hypoplasia) or absence (agenesis) of the band of nerve fibers that joins the brain's hemispheres (corpus callosum). Diagnosis is confirmed on the basis of specific MRI findings. In some affected individuals, the eye, skin, and brain findings involve only one side of the body. In these cases, the left side is involved twice as often as the right side. Additional findings may include rib and vertebral anomalies and craniofacial anomalies. Developmental delay and intellectual disability may be present and can vary from mild to profound. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have seizures. The exact cause of OCC syndrome is not known. In most cases, the affected individual is the first person in the family to have the disorder."
"Summary of Adult polyglucosan body disease: Adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) affects the nervous system. Signs and symptoms include trouble walking due to peripheral neuropathy and muscle weakness and stiffness. People with APBD also develop problems with bladder control due to damage to the bladder's nerves (neurogenic bladder). About half of people with APBD also develop dementia. APBD can be caused by genetic changes in the GBE1 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. In some cases, the cause is not known."
"Summary of Progressive osseous heteroplasia: Progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH) is a progressive bone disorder in which bone forms (ossifies) within skin, subcutaneous and deep tissue,  and muscle tissue.  Ossification may cause pain and open sores (ulcers) in affected areas of the body. Joints may become involved over time, causing impaired mobility. POH is caused by a genetic change in the GNAS gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In most cases, the genetic change occurs randomly in a person with no family history of POH. In some cases, the genetic change is inherited from a parent. POH is thought to be part of a spectrum of related genetic disorders which include Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, pseudohypoparathyroidism, and primary osteoma cutis. These disorders share the features of superficial ossification and being caused by genetic changes affecting the GNAS gene."
"Summary of Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare viral disease where tumors (papillomas) grow in the air passages leading from the nose and mouth into the lungs (respiratory tract). There are two types, a juvenile-onset form and an adult-onset form. The tumors can cause a hoarse voice, chronic cough, and difficulty breathing. They may vary in size and grow very quickly, and may grow back even when removed. These tumors rarely become cancerous, but can cause long-term airway and voice complications. RRP is caused by two types of human papillomavirus (HPV), called HPV 6 and HPV 11. It is transmitted from an infected mother to her baby through the placenta or through the birth canal. HPV can also be transmitted from one adult to another through oral sex. The HPV vaccine can help prevent infection."
"Summary of Retinopathy, arteriosclerotic: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type 1: Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type 1 is an inherited condition that primarily causes neurological problems. There are three types of Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiencies. Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type 1, also called the infantile type, is the most severe form. Affected individuals may have developmental delay, developmental regression (they lose developmental skills), blindness, and seizures, and they eventually lose awareness of their surroundings and become unresponsive. People with this form of the condition usually don't survive past early childhood. Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type 1 is caused by genetic changes in the NAGA gene. The condition follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Schinzel-Giedion syndrome: Schinzel Giedion syndrome (SGS) is a rare, severe condition that affects many parts of the body. Features of SGS include severe intellectual disability; a distinctive facial appearance; excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis); and various birth defects that may affect the skeletal system, genitourinary system; kidneys; and heart. SGS is caused by a genetic change in the SETBP1 gene. The genetic change is not inherited from a parent, but occurs for the first time in the affected child (a de novo genetic change)."
"Summary of Ulnar-mammary syndrome: Ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS) is a rare genetic syndrome that affects the development of several parts of the body. Features of UMS can be mild to severe and can vary significantly from person to person, even within the same family. The main features of UMS include upper limb defects (including abnormal or incomplete development of the fingers and forearm), underdevelopment of the mammary and apocrine glands (leading to absent breast development and the inability to produce breast milk), and various genital abnormalities. Other signs and symptoms may include hormonal deficiencies, delayed puberty (particularly in males), dental problems, short stature, and obesity. People with UMS may have distinct facial features, including a wide face tapering to a prominent chin, and a broad nose. UMS is caused by genetic changes in the TBX3 gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant. However, not all people who have or inherit a genetic change will have features of UMS. This phenomenon is called incomplete penetrance."

"Summary of Focal facial dermal dysplasia type III: Focal facial dermal dysplasia type III (FFDD3) is a rare focal facial dermal dysplasia (FFDD; see this term), characterized primarily by congenital bitemporal scar-like depressions and a typical, but variable facial dysmorphism, which may include distichiasis (upper lids) or lacking eyelashes, slanted eyebrows and a flattened and/or bulbous nasal tip and other features such as a low frontal hairline, sparse hair, redundant skin, epicanthal folds, low-set dysplastic ears, blepharitis and conjunctivitis."
"Summary of Singleton-Merten dysplasia: Singleton-Merten syndrome is a very rare disease that affect many organs. The main features are tooth abnormalities with gum infection; calcifications in the aorta artery and in certain valves of the heart (i.e., aortic and mitral valves); and progressive thinning and weakening of the bones (osteoporosis), especially in the upper and back portions of the skull. Other findings may include neurologic problems, generalized short stature, muscle weakness; poor muscle tone (hypotonia); progressive wasting of the muscles (muscle atrophy); heart arrhythmia, growth and developmental delay; skin problems such as psoriasis; malformation of the hips and/or feet and limbs or fingers, joint problems, tendon rupture, distinct facial features, and vision problems due to glaucoma. Severe systemic lupus erythematosus can also occur with Singleton-Merten syndrome. Singleton-Merten syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the IFIH1 gene, and in the DDX58 genes (which causes an atypical form of Singleton-Merten syndrome where there are no teeth problems). Inheritance is autosomal dominant, but it may also occur sporadically (in individuals with no history of the condition in their family). The genes causing Singeleton-Merten syndrome can activate type I interferon (IFN1) responses. Diseases related to INF1 are known as type I interferonopathies. Type I interferonopathies are a group of rheumatic diseases that are frequently severe.  These diseases include Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨, res syndrome, familial chilblain lupus, spondyloenchondrodysplasia, the proteasome associated autoinflammatory syndromes, IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) deficiency, Singleton-Merten syndrome, and STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI)."

"Summary of Primary cutaneous amyloidosis: Primary cutaneous amyloidosis is a form of amyloidosis, a group of conditions in which an abnormal protein (called amyloid) builds up in various organs and tissues throughout the body. In Primary cutaneous amyloidosis, specifically, this protein accumulates in the skin. There are three main forms of Primary cutaneous amyloidosis: Lichen amyloidosis - multiple itchy, raised spots which are scaly and red/brown in color. This rash generally affects the shins, thighs, feet and forearms. Macular amyloidosis - mild to severely itchy, flat, dusky-brown or greyish colored spots that may come together to form patches of darkened skin. This rash generally appears on the upper back between the shoulder blades, the chest and less commonly, the arms. Nodular amyloidosis - asymptomatic firm bumps that may be pinkish-brown to red in color. This rash may occur on the trunk, limbs, face, and/or genitals. The exact underlying cause of Primary cutaneous amyloidosis is poorly understood. It is sometimes associated with other conditions such as atopic dermatitis, sarcoidosis, and psoriasis. Although most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition, there are rare familial forms caused by changes in the OSMR or IL31RA gene."

It has been described in less than 20 cases. Some cases with the same clinical signs but without nasal defects have also been reported, and may represent the same entity. The etiology of LSS is unknown. Different modes of inheritance have been suggested."
"Summary of Muscle-eye-brain disease: Muscle eye brain disease (MEB) belongs to a group of genetic, degenerative muscular disorders (congenital muscular dystrophies). Individuals with this condition have muscle weakness (hypotonia), severe nearsightedness (myopia), glaucoma, and brain abnormalities. They also have developmental delay and intellectual disability, a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), and distinctive facial features. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the POMGNT1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Hirschsprung disease-deafness-polydactyly syndrome: Hirschsprung disease-deafness-polydactyly syndrome is an extremely rare malformative association, described in only two siblings to date, characterized by Hirschsprung disease (defined by the presence of an aganglionic segment of variable extent in the terminal part of the colon that leads to symptoms of intestinal obstruction, including constipation and abdominal distension), polydactyly of hands and/or feet, unilateral renal agenesis, hypertelorism and congenital deafness. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1988."
"Summary of Sarcosinemia: Sarcosinemia is a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by an increased level of the amino acid sarcosine in the blood and urine. It is reportedly most likely benign, unrelated to significant signs or symptoms. A number of children have been detected by newborn screening and have remained symptom-free. Some reports have associated Sarcosinemia with various symptoms including intellectual disability and other neurologic problems; growth failure; enlarged liver; cardiomyopathy; vision or hearing problems; and skeletal abnormalities. However, whether symptoms were attributable to Sarcosinemia or were coincidental is controversial. Sarcosinemia is sometimes caused by genetic changes in the SARDH gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It may also occur in some people with glutaric acidemia type II or severe folic acid deficiency. In some cases, the cause is unknown."
"Summary of Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized by aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp, breast anomalies ranging from hypothelia or athelia to amastia, and anomalies of the external ears.

Other skeletal abnormalities (delayed bone age, distally tapering fingers, hypoplastic distal phalanges, proximally placed thumbs, fifth finger clinodactyly), Pierre Robin sequence, cystic renal dysplasia, proximal renal tubular acidosis, hypospadias, cerebral anomalies on imaging (enlargement of lateral ventricles, mild cortical atrophy), seizures, hypotonia and developmental delay are also observed."
"Summary of Schizencephaly: Schizencephaly is a rare congenital (present from birth) brain malformation in which abnormal slits or clefts form in the cerebral hemispheres of the brain. The signs and symptoms of this condition may include developmental delay, seizures, and problems with brain-spinal cord communication. People with Schizencephaly may also have an abnormally small head (microcephaly); hydrocephalus; intellectual disability; partial or complete paralysis; and/or poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Severity of symptoms depends on many factors including the extent of the clefting and whether or not other brain abnormalities are present. Although the exact cause of Schizencephaly is unknown, it has been linked to a variety of genetic and non-genetic factors."

Signs and symptoms usually develop slowly over several months."
"Summary of Macrosomia-microphthalmia-cleft palate syndrome: Macrosomia-microphthalmia-cleft palate syndrome is a rare, genetic, multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized by early macrosomia, bilateral severe microphthalmia and a protuberant abdomen with hepatomegaly. Additional reported features include brachycephaly, large fontanelles, prominent forehead, upturned nose and median cleft palate. Cyanotic apneic spells and overwhelming infection lead to death within the first 6 months of life. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1989."
"Summary of MOMO syndrome: MOMO syndrome was named for the features associated with the syndrome including macrosomia (being larger than expected from birth), obesity, macrocephaly (having a large head size) and ocular (eye) abnormalities. It has also been proposed that mental (intellectual) disability may be used as an identifying feature of the syndrome instead of macrosomia, as macrosomia has not been reported in all affected individuals. The exact cause of MOMO syndrome is unknown. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns have been suggested. MOMO syndrome is diagnosed when a doctor observes signs consistent with the syndrome. Tests may be completed to rule out other genetic syndromes."
Summary of Macrothrombocytopenia progressive deafness: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of MYH9-related disease: MYH9-related thrombocytopenia (MYH9RD) is a genetic condition caused by genetic changes in the MYH9 gene and is characterized by large platelets and thrombocytopenia (low number of platelets) which increases the risk for mild to serious bleeding in the body or in the skin. Young-adult onset high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, presenile (early) cataract, and kidney disease also variably occurs in people with this condition. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The following conditions, once thought to be separate, are now known to be part of MYH9RD. Epstein syndrome  Fechtner syndrome  May-Hegglin anomaly  Sebastian syndrome"
"Summary of Stargardt disease: Stargardt disease is a genetic eye disorder that causes progressive vision loss. It affects the macula, an area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. Vision loss is due to abnormal accumulation of a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) in the cells within the macula. People with Stargardt disease also have problems with night vision, and some have problems with color vision. It is most commonly caused by genetic changes in the ABCA4 gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Rarely it may be caused by genetic changes in other genes and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy: Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is a slowly progressive form of macular degeneration. Affected people first have normal vision, followed by decreased central visual acuity and distorted vision (metamorphopsia). Peripheral vision is not affected. BVMD is characterized by impaired central visual function and atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. (The retina is the back part of the eye that contains the specialized cells that respond to light, known as photoreceptors.) BVMD is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. The condition is typically caused by genetic changes in the BEST1 gene; in a few cases the cause is unknown."
Summary of Bubonic plague: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Yellow nail syndrome: Yellow nail syndrome is a very rare disorder characterized by three features: yellow nail discoloration, respiratory problems, and lower limb swelling (lymphedema). In addition to being yellow, nails may lack a cuticle, grow very slowly, and become detached (onycholysis). Respiratory problems may include chronic cough, bronchiectasis, and pleural effusion. Chronic sinusitis may also occur. The cause of Yellow nail syndrome remains unknown. It usually occurs on its own, but is sometimes associated with autoimmune disease, lymphatic diseases, or cancers."
"Summary of Y chromosome infertility: Y chromosome infertility is a condition that affects the production of sperm, making it difficult or impossible for affected men to father children. An affected man's body may produce no sperm cells (azoospermia), a smaller than usual number of sperm cells (oligospermia), or sperm cells that are abnormally shaped or that do not move properly. This condition accounts for between 5 percent and 10 percent of cases of azoospermia or severe oligospermia. As its name suggests, this form of infertility is caused by changes in the Y chromosome, one of the sex chromosomes. Y chromosome infertility is usually caused by deletions of genetic material in regions of the Y chromosome called azoospermia factor (AZF) A, B, or C. Genes in these regions are believed to provide instructions for making proteins involved in sperm cell development, although the specific functions of these proteins are not well understood. In rare cases, changes to a single gene called USP9Y, which is located in the AZFA region of the Y chromosome, can cause Y chromosome infertility. Some men with Y chromosome infertility who have mild to moderate oligospermia may eventually father a child naturally. Assisted reproductive technologies may help other affected men. Because Y chromosome infertility impedes the ability to father children, this condition is usually caused by new deletions on the Y chromosome and occurs in men with no history of the disorder in their family. When men with Y chromosome infertility do father children, either naturally or with the aid of assisted reproductive technologies, they pass on the genetic changes on the Y chromosome to all their sons. As a result, the sons will also have Y chromosome infertility."

Summary of Kashani Strom Utley syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cataract-intellectual disability-anal atresia-urinary defects syndrome: Cataract-intellectual disability-anal atresia-urinary defects syndrome is characterised by congenital cataracts with squint, intellectual deficit, anomalies of the genitourinary tract (rectovesical fistula, micropenis, undescended testis, and hypospadias), imperforate anus and other anomalies."
"Summary of Opitz GBBB syndrome: Opitz G/BBB syndrome is an inherited condition that affects several structures along the midline of the body. The most common features are wide-spaced eyes and defects of the larynx, trachea, and/or esophagus causing breathing problems and difficulty swallowing. Affected males usually have a urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). Other features can include mild intellectual disability, cleft lip and/or a cleft palate, heart defects, an obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus), agenesis of the corpus callosum, and facial abnormalities. These features may vary, even among members of the same family. There are two forms of Opitz G/BBB syndrome, which are distinguished by their genetic causes and patterns of inheritance. The X-linked form is caused by genetic changes in the MID1 gene. Autosomal dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome is caused by a deletion of 22q11.2, and is often referred to as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome."
"Summary of Gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase deficiency: GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an important molecule which slows down the activity of cells in the brain. GABA is broken down in the body by a substance known as 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, also known as GABA-transaminase or GABA-T. Genetic changes in the ABAT gene can cause less GABA-T to be made, a condition known as GABA-T deficiency. The symptoms for an individual with GABA-T deficiency can include: psychomotor retardation (a slowing down of thought and activity), low muscle tone, hyperactive responses, lethargy, seizures, and EEG abnormalities. GABA-T deficiency is very rare. It is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis: Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is a genetic disease that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness and an increase of the potassium levels in the blood. Muscle weakness during an attack usually affects the arms and legs and muscles of the eyes, throat, and trunk. Most often, these episodes involve a temporary inability to move muscles in the arms and legs. Normally an episode lasts for 15 minutes to an hour, but in some people the episodes may last a few days to a week. Factors that can trigger attacks include rest after strenuous exercise, potassium-rich foods, stress, fatigue, and exposure to cold. Depolarizing anesthetics should also be avoided. Muscle strength usually returns to normal between episodes, although many people continue to experience mild stiffness, particularly in muscles of the face and hands. Some affected individuals may develop permanent muscle weakness and a chronic progressive myopathy. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is caused by genetic changes in the SCN4A gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms including the increase of blood potassium level during an episode but normal levels of blood potassium level in between episodes. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Proximal spinal muscular atrophy type 3: A rare, genetic proximal spinal muscular atrophy characterized by degeneration of alpha motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and lower brain stem manifesting with onset of progressive proximal muscle weakness (legs greater than arms) between 18 months and adulthood. Motor development is heterogeneous but walking is typically acquired."
"Summary of Central serous chorioretinopathy: Central serous chorioretinopathy is a disease that causes fluid to build up under the retina, the back part of the inner eye that sends sight information to the brain. The fluid leaks from the choroid (the blood vessel layer under the retina). The cause of this condition is unknown but stress can be a risk factor. Signs and symptoms include dim and blurred blind spot in the center of vision, distortion of straight lines and seeing objects as smaller or farther away."
"Summary of Ascher syndrome: Ascher Syndrome is a rare condition characterized by a combination of episodic edema or swelling of the eyelids (blepharochalasia), double lip, and nontoxic thyroid enlargement (goiter). The underlying cause of this condition is unknown. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance have also been reported. The condition is often undiagnosed due to its rarity."

Phenotype is highly variable but patients typically present facial dysmorphism (incl. asymmetry, hypertelorism), auricular abnormalities (e.g. preauricular tags, microtia, absence of middle ear ossicles), skeletal malformations (hemivertebrae, hip dislocation, sacral agenesis/dysplasia, talipes equinovarus, flexion deformity of lower limbs), cardiac defects (dextrocardia, septal defects), renal and genitourinary anomalies (such as renal agensis/dysplasia, abnormal external genitalia, cryptorchidia), as well as anal anomalies such as anal atresia and rectovesical fistula."
"Summary of Familial caudal dysgenesis: Familial caudal dysgenesis is a rare genetic condition that happens when a fetus is developing in the womb. It can cause different problems with the lower part of the body, such as having only one umbilical artery or an imperforate (closed) anus. Some people with this condition may have more severe problems, like having their legs fused together. This condition can run in families and may cause other features like heart or bone problems. People with this condition may also have facial differences."
"Summary of Camptodactyly-joint contractures-facial skeletal defects syndrome: A rare multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized by the association of camptodactyly, multiple eye defects (fibrosis of the medial rectus muscle, severe myopia, ptosis and exophthalmos), scoliosis, flexion contractures and facial anomalies (arched eyebrows, facial asymmetry with an abnormal skull shape, a prominent nose, small mouth, low-set and dysplastic ears, and a low nuchal hairline)."
Summary of Roy Maroteaux Kremp syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Rotor syndrome: Rotor syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). Bilirubin is produced when red blood cells are broken down, and has an orange-yellow tint. The buildup of bilirubin in the body causes yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice), which is the only symptom of the disorder. Rotor syndrome is caused by having genetic changes in both the SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Congenital giant megaureter: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Peripartum cardiomyopathy: Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is an idiopathic, potentially fatal form of dilated cardiomyopathy that develops during the final month of pregnancy or within five months after delivery."
"Summary of Dilated cardiomyopathy: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disease of the heart muscle which primarily affects the heart's main pumping chamber, the left ventricle. It is the most common type of cardiomyopathy. The left ventricle of affected individuals becomes enlarged (dilated) and cannot pump blood to the body with as much force as a healthy heart can. The heart muscle also has difficulty contracting normally, which can lead to irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia), blood clots, or sudden death. Over time, the heart becomes weaker and heart failure can occur. While the cause of Dilated cardiomyopathy is often unknown (idiopathic), some cases are acquired and roughly half are inherited or familial. Also, DCM can be a feature of many genetic syndromes. Familial Dilated cardiomyopathy is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Familial Dilated cardiomyopathy is caused by genetic changes in several different genes, most commonly in the TTN gene (found in about 20% of cases)."

"Summary of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome: Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS) is a mild form of INSR-related severe syndromic insulin resistance, an inherited disorder associated with the inability to regulate blood sugar. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that normally regulates blood sugar levels by promoting the movement of sugar (glucose) into cells for energy production or into the liver and fat cells for storage. Symptoms of RMS include poor growth before and after birth, hairiness, muscle wasting (hypertrophy), coarse facial features, abnormalities of the teeth and nails, and a skin abnormality known as acanthosis nigricans. In addition, people with RMS have excess blood insulin levels and irregular sugar (glucose) levels. Some people with RMS have developmental and intellectual disabilities. Over time, people with RMS can have organ damage due to unregulated blood sugar. This disorder is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms, laboratory testing, and genetic testing of the INSR gene. RMS is caused by a genetic change in the INSR gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism) is a more severe form of INSR-related syndromic insulin resistance. Symptoms are similar to those seen in RMS but are more serious. Type A insulin resistance syndrome (type A) is a milder form of INSR-related syndromic insulin resistance."

This disorder may be caused by genetic changes in any of 5 genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Medullary sponge kidney: Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is a birth defect of tiny tubes (tubules) inside the kidneys. In MSK, tiny sacs called cysts form in the inner part of the kidney (the medulla), creating a sponge-like appearance. The cysts keep urine from flowing freely through the tubules. Many people with MSK have no symptoms, but others may have blood in the urine, kidney stones, and urinary tract infections. Rarely, MSK leads to more serious problems, such as chronic pain and kidney failure. The cause for MSK is unknown but some cases may run in families."

Signs and symptoms may include muscle stiffness and weakness; joint deformities that affect mobility (contractures); short stature; small ""fixed"" facial features; and eye abnormalities. Previously, SJS was divided into types 1 and 2. SJS type 2 is now considered a distinct, more severe condition called Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome, which is caused by genetic changes in the LIFR gene. Type 1A, considered classic SJS, is the most commonly recognized type which manifests later with milder symptoms than type 1B. SJS is caused by genetic changes in the HSPG2 gene. SJS is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; however, some cases reported in the medical literature suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern."

"Summary of Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 12 with or without anosmia: Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (IGD) is characterized by inappropriately low serum concentrations of the gonadotropins LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) in the presence of low circulating concentrations of sex steroids. IGD is associated with a normal sense of smell (normosmic IGD) in approximately 40% of affected individuals and an impaired sense of smell (Kallmann syndrome) in approximately 60%. IGD can first become apparent in infancy, adolescence, or adulthood. Infant boys with congenital IGD often have micropenis and cryptorchidism. Adolescents and adults with IGD have clinical evidence of hypogonadism and incomplete sexual maturation on physical examination. Adult males with IGD tend to have prepubertal testicular volume (i.e., <4 mL), absence of secondary sexual features (e.g., facial and axillary hair growth, deepening of the voice), decreased muscle mass, diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility.

Summary of Jeune syndrome situs inversus: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Blau syndrome: Blau syndrome is a rare condition characterized mainly by skin rash, arthritis, and uveitis. Characteristic findings include synovial effusions (fluid in the joints due to inflammation) and cysts, anterior uveitis (swelling and irritation of the uvea), and focal posterior synechiae (adhesion of the iris to the cornea). Permanent bending of the fingers and toes (camptodactyly) and other findings have also been reported. It is caused by genetic changes in the NOD2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Blau syndrome and early-onset sarcoidosis have the same symptoms and genetic cause, but early-onset sarcoidosis is caused by de novo (new) genetic changes and occurs sporadically (in individuals with no history of the disorder in the family)."
"Summary of Conductive deafness-ptosis-skeletal anomalies syndrome: Conductive deafness-ptosis-skeletal anomalies syndrome is a rare, genetic ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by conductive hearing loss due to atresia of the external auditory canal and the middle ear complicated by chronic infection, ptosis and skeletal anomalies (internal rotation of hips, dislocation of the radial heads and fifth finger clinodactyly).

"Summary of Camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa-vara-pericarditis syndrome: Camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome (CACP) is a rare condition which causes joint abnormalities. The name comes from the main symptoms, including permanent bending of the fingers (camptodactyly), joint disease (arthropathy), and changes in the hip joint resulting in shortened legs and a possible limp (coxa vara). Some people with CACP also have too many cells between their joints (synovial hyperplasia) and too much fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion) or lungs (pleural effusion). Camptodactyly-arthyropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome is caused by a genetic change in the PRG4 gene. This gene is responsible for making a protein that lubricates the joints. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. CACP may be at first confused with juvenile idiopathic arthritis because the two diseases have similar symptoms. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings (symptoms which the doctor notices on a physical exam) and a biopsy of the fluid between the joints (synovial fluid). Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Jacobsen syndrome: Jacobsen syndrome is a condition characterized by the deletion of several genes on chromosome 11.

Other features may include compulsive behavior; attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); congenital heart defects; short stature; and/or skeletal abnormalities. In most cases, the deletion that causes Jacobsen syndrome is not inherited and occurs randomly due to an error in cell division. In some cases, an affected person inherits the deletion from an unaffected parent with a balanced translocation."
"Summary of Fibromatosis multiple non ossifying: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is characterized by multiple cafÃ© au lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple cutaneous neurofibromas, iris Lisch nodules, and choroidal freckling.

"Summary of Robinow syndrome: Robinow syndrome is a rare disorder that affects the bones as well as other parts of the body. Two forms of Robinow syndrome have been described: autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome, and the milder autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome. They are distinguished based on their modes of inheritance, symptoms, and severity. Autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome causes shortening of the long bones in the arms and legs; short fingers and toes; wedge-shaped spinal bones leading to kyphoscoliosis; fused or missing ribs; short stature; and distinctive facial features. Other features may include underdeveloped genitalia; dental problems; kidney or heart defects; or delayed development. This form is caused by genetic changes in the ROR2 gene. Autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome causes more mild, but similar, features. There are rarely spine and rib abnormalities, and short stature is less severe. A variant type of this form is additionally characterized by osteosclerosis. Autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome may be caused by a genetic change in the WNT5A or DVL1 gene. In some cases, the underlying cause of Robinow syndrome is unknown."

Characteristic ultrastructural findings are irregular thickening and moth-eaten appearance of the glomerular basement membrane with focal deposition of type III collagen fibrils."
"Summary of Senior-Loken syndrome: Senior Loken Syndrome (SLS) is a rare syndrome that mainly affects the kidneys and eyes. SLS causes a cystic kidney disease called nephronophthisis.  The kidneys develop cysts, inflammation, and scarring, which progressively impair kidney function. Symptoms of nephronophthisis may include increased production of urine, excessive thirst, weakness, and severe fatigue. SLS affects the eyes by causing varying degrees of retinal dystrophy, which is progressive wasting of the retina (the part of the eye that senses light and sends images to the brain). Some children with SLS have a severe type of retinal dystrophy called Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Symptoms of LCA include severe farsightedness, light sensitivity (photophobia), and nystagmus. Other children with SLS do not have LCA but develop symptoms of a retinal dystrophy called retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Symptoms of RP range in age of onset and severity and may include night blindness and progressive loss of peripheral vision and central vision.  In rare cases, additional symptoms such as liver fibrosis or skeletal abnormalities have been reported. SLS may be caused by genetic changes in any of several genes, and inheritance is autosomal recessive. The syndrome can be diagnosed based on symptoms, kidney and eye evaluations, and genetic testing."

"Summary of Twin to twin transfusion syndrome: Twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a rare condition that occurs during a twin pregnancy when blood moves from one twin (the 'donor twin') to the other (the 'recipient twin') while in the womb. TTTS is a complication that specifically occurs in identical (monozygotic) twin pregnancies that share the same ""egg"" sac (monochorionic) that may or may not share the same amniotic sac (monoamniotic). The donor twin may be born smaller, with paleness, anemia, and dehydration. The recipient twin may be born larger, with redness, too much blood, and increased blood pressure, resulting in an increased risk for heart failure."
"Summary of Wandering spleen: Wandering spleen is a rare condition that occurs when the spleen lacks one or more of the ligments that hold the spleen in its normal position in the upper left abdomen. If a person is born with this condition it is referred to as congenital Wandering spleen. The condition is not hereditary. Acquired Wandering spleen may occur due to injuries or other underlying conditions that may weaken the ligaments that hold the spleen. Symptoms of Wandering spleen may include englargement of the spleen (splenomegaly), abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, nausea, vomiting, fever, and a lump in the abdomen or the pelvis. Some individuals with this condition do not have symptoms."
"Summary of Wells syndrome: Wells syndrome is a rare eosinophilic disorder that primarily affects the skin.

Other signs and symptoms include intrauterine growth restriction, feeding difficulties, distinctive craniofacial features, hypotonia, developmental delay, and mild to severe intellectual disability. Although the exact underlying cause of Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome is unknown, it is likely a genetic condition that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Yunis-Varon syndrome: Yunis-Varon syndrome is a rare condition that affects many different parts of the body. Signs and symptoms may include underdeveloped or absent collarbones (clavicles); large fontanelles; characteristic facial features; hypotonia (reduced muscle tone) and/or abnormalities of the fingers and toes. Affected people may also experience feeding difficulties, breathing problems, brain malformations, heart defects, skeletal abnormalities, developmental delay, and/or intellectual disability. Yunis-Varon syndrome is caused by changes  in the FIG4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Cutis gyrata-acanthosis nigricans-craniosynostosis syndrome: Cutis gyrata-acanthosis nigricans-craniosynostosis syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by skin abnormalities (cutis gyrata, which causes a furrowed and wrinkled appearance, and acanthosis nigricans) and the premature fusion of certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis). This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. Cutis gyrata-acanthosis nigricans-craniosynostosis syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the FGFR2 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, although all reported cases have resulted from new genetic changes in the gene and occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
"Summary of Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome: Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome is a condition that affects the normal function of the lymphatic system (part of the immune system that produces and transports fluids and immune cells throughout the body). People with this syndrome have extra eyelashes (distichiasis) and develop puffiness or swelling (lymphedema) of the limbs, most often the legs and feet. The abnormal eyelashes, which grow along the inner lining of the eyelid, often touch the eyeball and can cause damage to the clear covering of the eye (cornea). Other eye problems such as an irregular curvature of the cornea causing blurred vision (astigmatism) or scarring of the cornea may also occur. Other health problems that may occur in Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome include varicose veins, droopy eyelids (ptosis), heart abnormalities, and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome is caused by changes (referred to as genetic changes or pathogenic variants) in the FOXC2 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis of this syndrome is based on a thorough clinical examination, detailed patient history, and identification of the symptoms mentioned above. Clinical genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis."

The SPG23 phenotype has been mapped to a locus on chromosome 1q24-q32."
Summary of Zerres Rietschel Majewski syndrome: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Zazam Sheriff Phillips syndrome: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Zadik Barak Levin syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Young syndrome: Young syndrome is a condition characterized by male infertility, damaged airways in the lungs (bronchiectasis), and inflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis). Male infertility in Young syndrome is secondary to obstructive azoospermia, a condition in which sperm are produced but do not mix with the rest of the ejaculatory fluid, due to a physical obstruction in the epididymis (tube through which sperm exit the testis). This results in nonexistent levels of sperm in semen. Young syndrome is typically diagnosed in men who undergo evaluation for infertility.

"Summary of 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development: 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development is a condition in which a person with two X chromosomes (which is normally found in females) has a male appearance. More specifically, people with this condition have male external genitalia, ranging from normal to ambiguous. Other common signs and symptoms include small testes, gynecomastia, infertility due to azoospermia (lack of sperm), and health problems related to low testosterone. Less often, affected people may experience abnormalities such as undescended testes and hypospadias. Gender role and gender identity are normally reported as male. This condition may occur if the SRY gene (which is usually found on the Y chromosome) is misplaced onto the X chromosome. This generally occurs to do an abnormal exchange of genetic material between chromosomes (a translocation). Less commonly, the condition may be due to copy number variants or rearrangements in or around the SOX9 or SOX3 gene. In some affected people, the underlying cause is unknown. In most cases, the condition occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."

Most people with Triple A syndrome have all three of these features, although some have only two. Several authors published descriptions of a more global autonomic disturbance associated with the original three characteristics, leading one author to suggest the name 4A syndrome (adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, alacrima, autonomic abnormalities). Specific autonomic disturbances described in this syndrome include abnormal pupillary reflexes, poor heart rate variability, and orthostatic hypotension. Affected individuals may also have developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech problems, a small head size, muscle weakness, movement problems, peripheral neuropathy, and optic atrophy.

It is characterized by extremely short limbs with short fingers and toes. ACG1B also causes hypoplasia of the thorax (a narrow chest). This condition causes protuberant abdomen (rounded - swollen belly). An excess of soft tissue relative to the short skeleton causes hydropic fetal appearance (a pale, swollen appearance). The face is flat, the neck is short, and the soft tissue of the neck may be thickened. ACG1B is a genetic condition caused by mutations in the SLC26A2 gene. Babies with this condition often die before or shortly after birth."
"Summary of Isovaleric acidemia: Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) occurs when the body cannot breakdown certain parts of the proteins found in food. This can cause a build-up of toxic substances which can lead to bouts of serious illness known as metabolic crises. There are two types of IVA. The acute, neonatal type has more severe symptoms. In the chronic, intermittent type symptoms can come and go. Symptoms include poor feeding, tremor, vomiting, low muscle tone, and lack of energy (lethargy). One characteristic sign of IVA is an odor of sweaty feet during illness. IVA occurs due to variants in the IVD gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis of IVD is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and blood and urine testing. The results of genetic testing may help confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Propionic acidemia: Propionic acidemia is an inherited condition in which the body can't breakdown certain parts of proteins and fats. This leads to a build-up of toxic substances and to bouts of serious illness called decompensation events or metabolic crises. Symptoms of a decompensation event include poor feeding, vomiting, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). Without early diagnosis and treatment, these symptoms may lead to more serious medical problems, including heart abnormalities, seizures, intellectual disability, coma, and possibly death. Propionic acidemia is caused by changes in the PCCA and PCCB genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, blood and urine testing, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."

"Summary of Acrofacial dysostosis, Rodríguez type: A rare, severe, multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized by severe mandibular hypoplasia, upper limb phocomelia with olygodactyly, absent fibula, and a number of additional skeletal (hypoplastic scapula and ischii, 11 ribs, clubfeet), facial (hypertelorism, hypoplastic supraorbital ridges, wide nasal bridge, microtia with low-set ears) and variable internal organ abnormalities (including arhinencephaly, hypolobulated lungs, and congenital cardiac defects), which usually lead to perinatal death. Surviving patients show features similar to Nagel syndrome."
"Summary of Acrofacial dysostosis, Weyers type: A rare ectodermal dysplasia syndrome with bone abnormalities characterized by onychodystrophy; anomalies of the lower jaw, oral vestibule and dentition; post-axialpolydactyly; moderately restricted growth with short limbs; and normal intelligence. Although it closely resembles Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (see this term), an allelic disorder and another type of ciliopathy, WAD is usually a milder disease without the presence of heart abnormalities and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Nager syndrome: Nager syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the limbs and face. The signs and symptoms of Nager syndrome vary among affected individuals, even among those in the same family. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the SF3B4 gene. While most cases are sporadic (occurring in families with no prior history of the disorder), autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported."
"Summary of Acrofacial dysostosis, Palagonia type: A very rare acrofacial dysostosis characterized by normal intelligence, shortness of stature, and mild acrofacial dysostosis (malar hypoplasia, micrognathia and webbing of digits with shortening of the fourth metacarpals) associated with oligodontia, normal or high arched palate, aplasia cutis verticis with pili torti, mild cutaneous syndactyly of digits 2-5, webbing of digits and shortening of the fourth metacarpals, and unilateral cleft lip. Features are similar to those seen in Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome, although the latter shows no sign of acrofacial dysostosis. There have been no further reports in the literature since 1997."
"Summary of Acromegaloid changes, cutis verticis gyrata and corneal leukoma: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Acromegaloid facial appearance syndrome: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome with a probable autosomal dominant inheritance, characterized by a progressively coarse acromegaloid-like facial appearance with thickening of the lips and intraoral mucosa, large and doughy hands and, in some cases, developmental delay.

It is a less severe form than acromesomelic dysplasia, Grebe type and acromesomelic dysplasia, Hunter-Thomson type ."
"Summary of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome: Acroosteolysis dominant type (AOD), also known as Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, is a condition characterized by bone abnormalities throughout the body. The signs and symptoms of this disorder vary greatly but may include osteoporosis (loss of bone mass), compression fractures, skull deformities, and curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The abnormalities associated with this condition may lead to short stature. Loss of bone (osteolysis) in the hands and feet is a characteristic feature of this condition. Other features of AOD may include distinctive facial features, loose joints, dental problems, excess body hair, recurrent infections, heart defects, and kidney abnormalities. AOD is caused by genetic changes in the NOTCH2 gene. The genetic change can be inherited from a parent, or it can be the result of a new genetic change in the affected individual."
"Summary of Acro-pectoro-renal field defect: Poland syndrome consists of unilateral absence or hypoplasia of the pectoralis muscle, most frequently involving the sternocostal portion of the pectoralis major muscle, and a variable degree of ipsilateral hand and digit anomalies, including symbrachydactyly. Sometimes called Poland sequence, it was first described by Poland (1841).Poland syndrome is most commonly a sporadic condition (David, 1982; Opitz, 1982), but familial cases have been reported."
"Summary of Acropectorovertebral dysplasia: A rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by fusion of the carpal and tarsal bones, with complex anomalies of the fingers and toes (preaxial polydactyly of the hands and/or feet, syndactyly of fingers and toes, hypoplasia and dysgenesis of metatarsal bones)."
"Summary of Acrorenal syndrome: A spectrum of congenital malformative disorders characterized by the co-occurrence of distal limb anomalies (usually bilateral cleft feet and/or hands) and renal defects (e.g. unilateral or bilateral agenesis), that can be associated with a variety of other anomalies such as those of genitourinary tract (genital anomalies, ureteral hypoplasias, vesicoureteral reflux), abdominal well defects, intestinal atresias, and lung malformations. Familial cases have been reported in which an autosomal recessive inheritance was suspected."
"Summary of Fetal retinoid syndrome: Fetal retinoid syndrome is a characteristic pattern of physical birth defects in a baby that has been exposed to retinoids during pregnancy. The best-known retinoid is isotretinoin (Accutane), a drug used to treat severe cystic acne. Babies exposed to retinoids during pregnancy may have a wide variety of symptoms. Some may have no symptoms at all, others may have only intellectual and learning problems, while others will have very severe symptoms. Birth defects associated with retinoid exposure include:  â¢ Growth delay â¢ Excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus) â¢ Abnormally small head size (microcephaly) â¢ Intellectual and learning disabilities â¢ Ear and eye abnormalities â¢ A split in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) and other facial differences â¢ Heart defects. It is thought that 20-35% of fetuses exposed to retinoids during pregnancy will develop some of these birth defects. Retinoids can cause these birth defects in the early weeks of pregnancy, even before a woman knows that she is pregnant. Some of the birth defects associated with Fetal retinoid syndrome may be diagnosed by ultrasound during pregnancy. Currently, public health programs exist to help reduce the chance that a woman will use retinoids if she is considering getting pregnant."
"Summary of Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia: Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia (IAEP) is characterized by the rapid accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell and are part of the immune system. Signs and symptoms may include fever, cough, fatigue, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), muscle pain, chest pain, and acute respiratory failure. The term 'idiopathic' means the exact cause for the overproduction of eosinophils is not known. Possible triggers of acute eosinophilic pneumonia include cigarette smoking, occupational exposure to dust and smoke, and certain medications.  Diagnosis of IAEP generally involves a bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)."
"Summary of Sweet syndrome: Sweet syndrome is a skin condition characterized by fever, inflammation of the joints (arthritis), and painful skin lesions that appear mainly on the face, neck, back and arms. Although middle-aged women are most likely to develop this condition, it may also affect men, older adults and even infants. The exact cause of Sweet syndrome often isn't known. It is suspected that it can be a reaction of the body to certain exposures (sun), infections (Streptococcus bacteria, Campylobacter), or medications (azathioprine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications). This condition can also occur with some types of cancer and other serious health problems."
"Summary of Acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). It may develop in children or adults. ALL spreads to the blood and then may spread to other areas of the body such as the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, central nervous system, and testicles (in males). Signs and symptoms of ALL may include fever, easy bruising or bleeding, feeling tired, loss of appetite, pain in the bones or abdomen, and painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin. ALL is typically caused by random, non-inherited changes in the DNA of immature lymphocytes called lymphoblasts. However, some people may inherit a genetic susceptibility to developing ALL. The risk to develop ALL may also be increased by past treatment for cancer and by having certain genetic conditions or syndromes. Having one or more risk factors does not mean that a person definitely will develop ALL."
"Summary of Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia: A rare acute myeloid leukemia that occurs predominantly in childhood and particularly in children with Down syndrome (DS-AMKL). Nonspecific symptoms may be irritability, weakness, and dizziness while specific symptoms include pallor, fever, mucocutaneous bleeding, hepatosplenomegaly, neurological manifestations and rarely lymphadenopathy. Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis may also be associated with AMKL. In contrast to DS-AMKL (around 80 % survival), non-DS-AMKL is an AML subgroup associated with poor prognosis."
"Summary of Acute monoblastic/monocytic leukemia: Acute monoblastic/monocytic leukemia (AML-M5), is one of the most common subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; see this term) that is either comprised of more than 80% of monoblasts (AML-M5a) or 30-80% monoblasts with (pro)monocytic differentiation (AML-M5b). AML-M5 presents with asthenia, pallor, fever, and dizziness. Specific features of AML-M5 include hyperleukocytosis, propensity for extramedullary infiltrates, coagulation abnormalities including disseminated intravascular coagulation and neurological disorders.

AMML is one type of acute myeloid leukemia, a group of blood cancers that occur when the amount of white blood cells increases rapidly. Symptoms of AMML often include fatigue (due to anemia) or easy bruising or bleeding (due to thrombocytopenia). The cause of AMML is currently unknown."
"Summary of Acute non lymphoblastic leukemia: CEBPA-associated familial acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is defined as AML in which a heterozygous germline CEBPA pathogenic variant is present in a family in which multiple individuals have AML. In contrast, sporadic CEBPA-associated AML is defined as AML in which a CEBPA pathogenic variant(s) is identified in leukemic cells but not in the non-leukemic cells. Too few individuals with CEBPA-associated familial AML have been reported to be certain about the natural history of the disease. In the majority of individuals, the age of onset of familial AML appears to be earlier than sporadic AML; disease onset has been reported in persons as young as age 1.8 years and older than age 45 years. The prognosis of CEBPA-associated familial AML appears to be favorable compared with sporadic CEBPA-associated AML. Individuals with CEBPA-associated familial AML who have been cured of their initial disease may be at greater risk of developing additional independent leukemic episodes in addition to the risk of relapse due to preexisting clones."
"Summary of Acute promyelocytic leukemia: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is an aggressive type of acute myeloid leukemia in which there are too many immature blood-forming cells (promyelocytes) in the blood and bone marrow. This build up of promyelocytes leads to a shortage of normal white and red blood cells and platelets in the body. The signs and symptoms of APL include an increased risk to both bleed and form blood clots. Individuals may also experience excessive tiredness, pain in affected areas, loss of appetite, and weight loss. It is caused by a genetic change that is acquired over a person's lifetime, usually involving a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17."
"Summary of Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is an inherited metabolic disorder that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting). People with MCADD do not have enough of an enzyme needed to metabolize a group of fats called medium-chain fatty acids. Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, lack of energy, and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms can be triggered by periods of fasting or by illnesses. MCADD is caused by genetic changes in the ACADM gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency: A rare genetic nephropathy secondary to a disorder of purine metabolism characterized by the formation and hyperexcretion of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA) in urine, causing urolithiasis and crystalline nephropathy."
"Summary of Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency: Adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1 (AMPD1) deficiency is an inherited condition that can affect the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Many people with AMPD1 deficiency do not have symptoms. People who do have symptoms typically have muscle pain (myalgia), cramping, and weakness after exercise, and often get tired faster than others. Some affected people appear to have more severe symptoms. AMPD1 deficiency is caused by changes in the AMPD1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Other types of AMPD deficiency include the acquired type (due to a muscle or joint condition) and the coincidental inherited type (due to both genetic changes in the AMPD1 gene and a separate muscle or joint disorder)."
Summary of Anemia due to Adenosine triphosphatase deficiency: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency: Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency impacts the way the body breaks down certain chemicals and results in damage to the nervous system. There are several types of Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. Symptoms vary greatly from person to person. In general, Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency causes intellectual and movement disabilities, autistic features, epilepsy, low muscle tone, and feeding problems. Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency occurs due to a ADSL gene that is not working correctly and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. It is diagnosed based on the clinical examination, imaging studies, laboratory tests, and confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita: X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita is an inherited disorder that mainly affects males. It involves many hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues in the body, particularly a pair of small glands on top of each kidney called the adrenal glands. These glands produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. Congenital adrenal hypoplasia is characterized by adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Congenital adrenal hypoplasia is caused by genetic changes in the NR0B1 gene. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern."
"Summary of Adrenocortical carcinoma: Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare cancer affecting the outside of the adrenal glands (adrenal cortex). These glands are on top of each kidney and are responsible for producing certain hormones and keeping blood pressure at normal levels. Symptoms of Adrenocortical carcinoma may include pain in the abdomen, hypertension, weight gain, frequent urination and possibly deepening of the voice. These symptoms are due to the tumors causing excess secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands. Adrenocortical carcinoma may develop by chance alone, but at least 50% of the cancers are thought to be hereditary. There are a number of genes that have changes that can cause an Adrenocortical carcinoma, including TP53 and IGF2. There have been reports of both autosomal dominant inheritance and autosomal recessive inheritance. An Adrenocortical carcinoma is diagnosed based on urine tests for abnormal levels of cortisol, the hormone released by the adrenal glands. Blood tests can also be conducted to measure levels of potassium and sodium in the blood. A CT scan or MRI may be used to search for a visible tumor in the adrenal cortex."
"Summary of Neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy: A variant of intermediate severity of the PBD-Zellweger syndrome spectrum (PBD-ZSS) charcterized by hypotonia, leukodystrophy, and vision and sensorineural hearing deficiencies. Phenotypic overlap is seen between NALD and infantile Refsum disease (IRD)."

"Summary of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome is an inherited disease that mainly affects the brain, immune system, and the skin. Loss of white matter in the brain (leukodystrophy) and abnormal deposits of calcium (calcification) in the brain leads to an early-onset severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) that usually results in severe intellectual and physical disability. Additional symptoms may include epilepsy, painful, itchy skin lesion (chilblains), vision problems, and joint and muscle stiffness (spasticity), involuntary muscle twisting and contractions (dystonia), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in the torso. Other signs and symptoms may include a very small head (microcephaly), presence of white blood cells and other sign of inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). There are several types of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, depending on the gene that causes the condition: TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR and IFIH1, genes. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, although rare autosomal dominant cases have been reported."

"Summary of Alopecia-intellectual disability syndrome: An extremely rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability described in less than 20 families to date and characterized by total or partial alopecia associated with intellectual deficit. The syndrome can be associated with other anomalies such as seizures, sensorineural hearing loss, delayed psychomotor development, and/or hypertonia."
"Summary of Alopecia totalis: Alopecia totalis (AT) is a condition characterized by the complete loss of hair on the scalp. It is an advanced form of alopecia areata a condition that causes round patches of hair loss. Although the exact cause of AT is unknown, it is thought to be an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles. Roughly 20% of affected people have a family member with alopecia, suggesting that genetic factors may contribute to the development of AT."
"Summary of Alopecia universalis: Alopecia universalis (AU) is a condition characterized by the complete loss of hair on the scalp and body. It is an advanced form of alopecia areata, a condition that causes round patches of hair loss. Although the exact cause of AU is unknown, it is thought to be an autoimmune condition in which the person's immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles."

"Summary of Alpha-thalassemia: Alpha-thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the body's production of hemoglobin. Affected people have anemia, which can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. Two types of Alpha-thalassemia can cause health problems: the more severe type is known as Hb Bart syndrome; the milder form is called HbH disease. Hb Bart syndrome may be characterized by hydrops fetalis; severe anemia; hepatosplenomegaly; heart defects; and abnormalities of the urinary system or genitalia. HbH disease may cause mild to moderate anemia; hepatosplenomegaly; jaundice; or bone changes. Alpha-thalassemia typically results from deletions involving the HBA1 and HBA2 genes. The inheritance is complex, and can be read about here."
"Summary of Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome: Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. Most affected individuals experience progressive loss of kidney function, usually resulting in end-stage kidney disease. People with Alport syndrome frequently develop sensorineural hearing loss. The eye abnormalities seen in this condition seldom lead to vision loss. Alport syndrome can have different patterns of inheritance. Alport syndrome has autosomal dominant inheritance in about 5 percent of cases. People with this form of Alport syndrome have one genetic change in either the COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene in each cell."
"Summary of Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome: Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. Most affected individuals experience progressive loss of kidney function, usually resulting in end-stage kidney disease. People with Alport syndrome frequently develop sensorineural hearing loss. The eye abnormalities seen in this condition seldom lead to vision loss. Alport syndrome can have different patterns of inheritance. About 15 percent of Alport syndrome cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by genetic changes in both copies of the COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes."
Summary of Familial Alzheimer disease: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Leber congenital amaurosis: Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is an eye disorder that primarily affects the retina. People with this condition typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. Other features include photophobia, involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness. The pupils also do not react normally to light. Additionally, the cornea may be cone-shaped and abnormally thin (keratoconus). Franceschetti's oculo-digital sign is characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. This sign consists of poking, pressing, and rubbing the eyes with a knuckle or finger. Different subtypes have been described. The different subtypes are caused by genetic changes in different genes. Some of these subtypes are also distinguished by their patterns of vision loss and related eye abnormalities."
"Summary of Leber congenital amaurosis 2: Leber congenital amaurosis 2 (LCA2) is a severe inherited retinal degeneration (IRD). It typically presents between birth and five years of age. While central vision varies, the hallmark of this disorder is the presence of severe visual impairment with a deceptively preserved retinal structure. Vision is relatively stable in the first decade of life but begins to decline in adolescence. Most affected individuals are legally blind by 20 years of age. After age 20, visual acuity declines further. By the fourth decade all affected individuals are legally blind. Many have complete loss of vision (i.e., no light perception). LCA2 is caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that two copies of the mutated gene are required to cause the disease."
"Summary of Amaurosis-hypertrichosis syndrome: A rare, syndromic, inherited retinal disorder characterized by cone-rod type congenital amaurosis, severe retinal dystrophy leading to visual impairment and profound photophobia (without night blindness), and trichomegaly (bushy eyebrows with synophrys, excessive facial and body hair (including marked circumaleolar hypertrichosis).

"Summary of Beta-mercaptolactate cysteine disulfiduria: An extremely rare disorder of methionine cycle and sulfur amino acid metabolism characterized by increased urine excretion of beta-mercaptolactate-cysteine disulfide (due to deficiency of mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase activity in erythrocytes), leading to a positive cyanide nitroprusside test. Association with intellectual disability, congenital lens dislocation, and behavioral abnormalities has been reported, however the causal link remains to be established. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1981."
"Summary of Familial transthyretin amyloidosis: Familial transthyretin amyloidosis (FTA) is a rare inherited condition characterized by abnormal build-up of a protein called amyloid in the body's organs and tissues. Signs and symptoms depend on where the amyloid protein is building up. Amyloid build-up in the nerves of the peripheral nervous system causes a loss of sensation in the lower limbs, feet, and hands (peripheral neuropathy). Amyloid build-up can also affect the involuntary body functions, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and digestion. Other areas of the body that may be affected are the heart, kidneys, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract. FTA is caused by changes in the TTR gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, but not all people with a TTR genetic change will develop FTA. Diagnosis of FTA is suspected by signs and symptoms and confirmed by tissue biopsy and genetic testing."

"Summary of Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency: Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a disease that affects the production of signals that allow cells in the nervous system to communicate with each other. These signals are called neurotransmitters. When the neurotransmitters are not being produced correctly, there are problems with the nervous system. Individuals affected by this disease often have trouble coordinating movements, especially of the head, face, and neck. Other symptoms of the condition include problems controlling blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. AADC deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the DDC gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis of the disease may be established based on a spinal tap and a blood test that show abnormalities in levels of neurotransmitters and enzymes related to the disorder. Genetic testing may be used to confirm the diagnosis."

Arterial tortuosity syndrome is caused by alterations in the SLC2A10 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita: Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) refers to the development of multiple joint contractures affecting two or more areas of the body prior to birth. A contracture occurs when a joint becomes permanently fixed in a bent or straightened position, which can impact the function and range of motion of the joint and may lead to muscle atrophy. AMC is not a specific diagnosis, but rather a physical symptom that can be associated with many different medical conditions. It is suspected that AMC is related to decreased fetal movement during development which can have a variety of different causes, including environmental factors (i.e. maternal illness, limited space), single gene changes (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked), chromosomal abnormalities and various syndromes."

"Summary of Neurogenic arthrogryposis multiplex congenita: Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita neurogenic type (AMCN) refers to the development of multiple joint contractures affecting two or more areas of the body prior to birth. A contracture occurs when a joint becomes permanently fixed in a bent or straightened position, which can impact the function and range of motion of the joint and lead to muscle atrophy. Signs and symptoms of AMCN vary. AMCN can affect upper and lower joints, including the wrists, elbows, fingers, knees, ankles, and hip. In AMCN, arthrogryposis occurs as a result of the abnormal development of cells in the spinal cord (anterior horn cells) or brainstem (motor nuclei). AMCN often occurs sporadically (in a person with no family history of the condition), however families with multiple affected members have also been reported. In most cases, the underlying genetic cause remains unknown."

"Summary of Alagille syndrome: Alagille syndrome is a genetic syndrome that can affect the liver and other parts of the body. The liver problems result from having fewer small bile ducts than normal in the liver. This leads to bile building-up inside the liver, which in turn causes liver scarring and damage. Signs and symptoms of Alagille syndrome are generally noticed in infancy or early childhood. Type of symptoms and severity varies greatly, even among people in the same family, so that in some cases the symptoms are severe, and in others, very mild. The liver problems may be the first symptoms of the syndrome, and may include yellow color of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice); itchy skin; bumps on the skin caused by deposits of cholesterol and fats (xanthomas); pale, loose bowel movements; and poor growth.  Alagille syndrome can also affect other parts of the body including the heart, brain, kidneys, blood vessels, eyes, face, and skeleton. People with Alagille syndrome may have distinctive facial features too, including a broad, prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, and a small, pointed chin. Alagille syndrome is caused by changess in the JAG1 and NOTCH2 genes. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. However, in about half of cases the genetic change occurs as a new change (""de novo"") without being inherited from either parents."

"Summary of Balantidiasis: Balantidiasis is an infectious disease, rare in western countries. It is caused by Balantidium coli, a single celled parasite (ciliate protozoan) that is usually associated with intestinal infection in areas associated with pig rearing. It infects humans occasionally, mostly immunocompromised patients. Some infected people may have no symptoms or only mild diarrhea and abdominal discomfort but others may experience more severe symptoms reminiscent of an acute inflammation of the intestines. Symptoms of Balantidiasis may be similar to those of other infections that cause intestinal inflammation, for example, amoebic dysentery. On very rare occasions this bacterium may invade extra-intestinal organs, mostly the lungs. Metronidazole is the treatment of choice."
"Summary of Bangstad syndrome: Bangstad syndrome is a rare endocrine disease characterized by the association of primordial birdheaded nanism, progressive ataxia, goiter, primary gonadal insufficiency and insulin resistant diabetes mellitus.

A generalized cell membrane defect was suggested to be the pathophysiological abnormality in these patients. The mode of inheritance was thought to be autosomal recessive. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1989."
"Summary of Banki syndrome: Banki syndrome is a synostosis syndrome, reported in a single Hungarian family in which members of 3 generations showed lunotriquetral synostosis, clinodactyly, clinometacarpy, brachymetacarpy and leptometacarpy (thin diaphysis).

"Summary of Frontometaphyseal dysplasia: Frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities in skeletal development and problems in other organs of the body. It is part of a group of diseases called otopalatodigital spectrum disorders, which also includes otopalatodigital syndrome type 1, otopalatodigital syndrome type 2, and Melnick-Needles syndrome. In general, these disorders involve hearing loss (due to malformations in the tiny bones in the ears (ossicles)), cleft roof of the mouth (palate), and defects of the bones in the fingers and/or toes (digits). Frontometaphyseal dysplasia is distinguished from the other diseases of the group by the presence of joint deformities (contractures) that restrict the movement of certain joints. Other symptoms may include prominent brow ridges; wide-set and downward-slanting eyes; a very small lower jaw and chin (micrognathia); small, missing or misaligned teeth; bowed limbs; an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis); obstruction of ureters; heart defects; and breathing problems.

"Summary of Seizures, benign familial infantile, 1: Benign familial infantile seizures (BFIS) is a type of seizure disorder that affects young children, typically between 3 and 24 months of age. Seizures are when the body has sudden movements and changes in breathing. They can happen in clusters over a day or several days. Seizures start with the head and eyes moving slowly to one side and then progress to the body stopping moving and breathing. The body may also turn blue and have jerking movements. After the seizure, the baby will be normal again. The EEG test may show that there was unusual activity in a specific part of the brain during a seizure, but the brain activity was normal when there was no seizure. However, the person's mental and physical development was normal during and after the seizure. BFIS is a genetic disorder, and there are different types caused by variations in different genes. BFIS1 is caused by a mutation in a gene on chromosome 19q. BFIS2 is caused by a mutation in the PRRT2 gene on chromosome 16p11. BFIS3 is caused by mutations in the SCN2A gene on chromosome 2q24 and has a slightly earlier age at onset. BFIS4 has been mapped to chromosome 1p, and BFIS5 is caused by a mutation in the SCN8A gene on chromosome 12q13. BFIS6 is caused by a mutation in the CHRNA2 gene on chromosome 8p21."

In the early stages, IgA nephropathy has no symptoms. The first sign of this condition may be blood in the urine. End-stage kidney disease may develop. In most instances, the cause of this condition is unknown; however, certain disorders have been linked with IgA nephropathy, such as cirrhosis of the liver, celiac disease, and HIV infection. Although IgA nephropathy usually occurs in a family with no other affected members, several cases of familial IgA nephropathy have been reported. Familial IgA nephropathy is suspected to run through families in an autosomal dominant manner and is linked to genetic material on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q22-23)."
"Summary of Chronic beryllium disease: A pneumoconiosis, characterized by granulomatous inflammation, that occurs in individuals who develop beryllium sensitization (BeS), a cell-mediated immune response to environmental and occupational beryllium exposure.

Summary of Beta-sarcoglycanopathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Beta-thalassemia: Beta-thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the body's production of hemoglobin. Low levels of hemoglobin lead to a shortage of mature red blood cells and a lack of oxygen in the body. People with Beta-thalassemia have anemia, which can cause paleness, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. There are two main forms of Beta-thalassemia, classified based on the severity of symptoms: Thalassemia major (also called Cooley's anemia) - the more severe form, causing severe anemia and enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Thalassemia intermedia - the less severe form causing milder anemia that does not require regular blood transfusions. People with this form are also at risk for iron overload. Beta-thalassemia is caused by genetic changes in the HBB gene and is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that people with thalassemia major or thalassemia intermedia have a genetic change in both of their copies of the HBB gene. People who have only one HBB genetic change (carriers) typically are said to have thalassemia minor (or trait) and usually do not have symptoms, but may have some symptoms of anemia. Very rarely, the inheritance of Beta-thalassemia may be dominant. In this case, a person has only one mutated HBB gene, but has signs and symptoms of Beta-thalassemia major or Beta-thalassemia intermedia."
"Summary of Beta-ketothiolase deficiency: Beta-ketothiolase deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the body cannot effectively process a protein building block (amino acid) called isoleucine. This condition also impairs the body's ability to process ketones, which are molecules produced during the breakdown of fats. Affected children experience intermittent episodes of ketoacidosis, characterized by vomiting, dehydration, difficulty breathing, extreme tiredness (lethargy), and occasionally, seizures. In severe cases, these episodes can lead to coma. Metabolic stroke is another finding that has been increasingly reported in children with this condition. Ketoacidotic attacks are frequently triggered by infections, periods without food (fasting), or increased intake of protein-rich foods. Beta ketothiolase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is caused by pathogenic variants in the ACAT1 gene."
"Summary of Bethlem myopathy: Bethlem myopathy is a rare disease affecting the skeletal muscles and connective tissue. The disease is characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness and joint stiffness (contractures). It most often affects the fingers, wrists, elbows, and ankles. Signs and symptoms may begin before birth (with decreased fetal movements), shortly after birth (with low muscle tone or torticollis), in early childhood (with delayed motor skills, muscle weakness, and contractures), or in adulthood (with weakness, Achilles tendon, or finger contractures). Rarely, severe muscle weakness may lead to respiratory difficulties in later life. Bethlem myopathy is caused by genetic changes (changes) in the COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 genes. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but in rare cases the disease is autosomal recessive. The diagnosis is based on clinical examination and laboratory tests, but genetic testing may confirm the diagnosis."

"Summary of Bifid nose: A Bifid nose is a relatively uncommon malformation that is characterized by the nose being divided into two parts. There is a large degree of variability in the severity of the condition, ranging from a minimally noticeable groove down the center of the nasal tip to a complete clefting of the underlying bones and cartilage, resulting in 2 complete half noses. It is often associated with hypertelorbitism and midline clefts of the lip. The airway usually is adequate despite the cosmetic appearance associated with the condition. Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance of a Bifid nose has been observed. It may also occur with frontonasal dysplasia (a condition in with several possible findings limited to the head and neck), for which several inheritance patterns have been reported."

"Summary of Biotinidase deficiency: Biotinidase deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to recycle the vitamin biotin. The more severe form of the disorder is called 'profound Biotinidase deficiency' and may cause delayed development, seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), breathing problems, hearing and vision loss, problems with movement and balance (ataxia), skin rashes, hair loss (alopecia), and a fungal infection called candidiasis. The milder form is called 'partial Biotinidase deficiency' In some cases, these symptoms only appear during illness, infection, or other times of stress on the body. Biotinidase deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the BTD gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

"Summary of Bloom syndrome: Bloom syndrome affects many different body systems and is characterized by slow growth, sun sensitivity, and an increased risk of cancer. Symptoms include short stature, sun-sensitive skin rash, and an immune system that doesn't work correctly. Some people with Bloom syndrome have learning disabilities, type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and develop cancer. Bloom syndrome is caused by genetic variants in the BLM gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, a clinical examination, and confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Blount disease: Blount disease is a growth disorder of the shin bone (tibia) characterized by inward turning of the lower leg (bowing) that slowly worsens over time. While it is not uncommon for young children to have bowed legs, typically the bowing improves with age. Blount disease may occur in one or both legs and can lead to shortening of the affected leg and other changes within bones of the legs. The cause of Blount disease is not well understood; however, a variety of hereditary and genetic factors are likely involved. The condition is more common among certain populations and is associated with obesity and early walking."
"Summary of Blue cone monochromatism: Blue cone monochromatism is an inherited vision disorder. In this condition, the light sensitive cells in the eye used for color vision (cones) are affected. There are three types of cones that respond to one of three colors: red, green, and blue. When people have Blue cone monochromatism, both the red and green cones do not function properly, while the blue cones work normally. Signs and symptoms may include impaired color vision, low visual acuity (clarity or sharpness), photophobia (light sensitivity), myopia (nearsightedness), and nystagmus (fast, uncontrollable movements of the eye). Blue cone monochromatism is caused by genetic changes in either the OPN1LW or the OPN1MW gene(s) and is inherited in an X-linked manner."
"Summary of Brachymorphism-onychodysplasia-dysphalangism syndrome: Brachymorphism-onychodysplasia-dysphalangism syndrome (BOD syndrome) is a genetic condition characterized by underdeveloped âpinkyâ toenails or fingernails, normal intellect to mild intellectual disability, distinct facial features, and short stature. The cause of the condition is not known. BOD syndrome is thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, however in many cases the condition occurs for the first time in a family due to a new genetic change. Signs and symptoms of BOD syndrome are similar to, albeit milder than that of, Coffin-Siris syndrome. The relationship between these syndromes is presently unknown."

There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1989."
"Summary of Brachydactyly type B: Brachydactyly type B (BDB) is a condition characterized by incomplete development (hypoplasia) or absence of the outermost bones of the fingers and toes (distal phalanges) and nails. Additional features may include hypoplasia of the middle phalanges, fusion of the joints (symphalangism), broad thumbs, and webbed fingers (syndactyly). The feet are often less severely affected than the hands. There are 2 types of this condition, designated as type 1 and 2. BDB type 1 is caused by genetic changes in the ROR2 gene. BDB type 2 is caused by genetic changes in the NOG gene. Inheritance of both types is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Brachydactyly type C: Brachydactyly type C is a very rare congenital condition that is characterized by shortening of certain bones in the index, middle and little fingers. The bones of the ring finger are typically normal. Other abnormalities may also be present such as hypersegmentation (extra bones) of the index and middle fingers; ulnar deviation (angled towards the fifth finger) of the index finger; and unusually-shaped bones and/or epiphysis (end of a long bone). Brachydactyly type C is typically caused by changes in the GDF5 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Brachydactyly type E: Brachydactyly type E is a genetic disorder that causes some of the bones of the hands or feet to be shorter than expected. Other signs of the disorder may include having very flexible joints (hyperextensibility) in the hands and being shorter than family members who do not have the disorder (short stature). Brachydactyly type E can be isolated or syndromic. If the disorder is isolated, it means that the person does not have any other health problems or symptoms related to having Brachydactyly type E. If Brachydactyly type E is syndromic, it means a person has another genetic disease or health issue that includes the shortening of the hand and feet bones as one of its symptoms. Isolated Brachydactyly type E is caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variantss) in the HOXD13 gene. Pathogenic variants in the the PTHLH gene may also cause Brachydactyly type E associated with short height. In both of these cases, the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Other genetic changes are known to cause syndromes that include Brachydactyly type E as a symptom. In these cases, the inheritance pattern depends on the underlying syndrome. Brachydactyly type E can be diagnosed if a doctor notices very flexible joints of the hands and shortening of the bones in the hands or feet. Genetic testing may be used to rule out genetic syndromes associated with brachydactyly."

"Summary of Osteogenesis imperfecta: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the development of the bones. People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from little or no trauma. However, the severity is different from person to person. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can even occur before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. People with OI may also have dental problems (dentinogenesis imperfecta) and hearing loss in adulthood. Other features may include muscle weakness, loose joints, and skeletal malformations. There are various recognized forms of OI which are distinguished by their features and genetic causes. Depending on the genetic cause, OI may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (more commonly) or autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, imaging studies, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
Summary of Brittle bone syndrome lethal type: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Brittle cornea syndrome: Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) is a genetic disease involving the connective tissue in the eyes, ears, joints, and skin. The symptoms of BCS typically involve thinning of the protective outer layer of the eye (cornea), which may lead to tearing or rupture after minor damage to the cornea. Other eye symptoms may include nearsightedness (myopia), a blueish tint in the white part of the eyes (blue sclera), and retinal detachment. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, abnormal positioning of the hip bones (hip dysplasia), and soft skin with abnormal scarring. There are 2 types of BCS. BCS type 1 is caused by changes in the ZNF469 gene and BCS type 2 is caused by changes in the PRDM5 gene. BCS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The diagnosis of BCS is made based on symptoms and may be confirmed through genetic testing."

"Summary of Brugada syndrome: Brugada syndrome is a heart condition that causes a disruption of the normal rhythm in the heart's lower chambers (ventricular arrhythmia). Signs and symptoms usually develop in adulthood but the diagnosis may be made at any age. Symptoms and complications often occur during rest or sleep, and may include fainting, seizures, difficulty breathing, or sudden death. The underlying genetic cause of inherited forms of Brugada syndrome is not known in most cases, but in up to 20-30% of people with Brugada syndrome, it is caused by a genetic change in the SCN5A gene. A number of other genes have been reported to be associated with Brugada syndrome in the literature, but the role they play in causing Brugada syndrome remains to be clearly defined. The genetic form of Brugada syndrome typically is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. An acquired (nongenetic) form has been associated with certain drugs; abnormally high blood levels of calcium or potassium; or very low levels of potassium. In some cases, the cause of Brugada syndrome is unknown."
"Summary of X-linked agammaglobulinemia: X-linked agammaglobulinema is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by very low levels of immunoglobulins (proteins made by the immune system to help fight infections). People affected by this condition generally begin developing frequent and recurrent bacterial infections from about 6 months of age. Commonly diagnosed infections include lung infections (pneumonia and bronchitis), middle ear infections, conjunctivitis, sinus infections, various skin infections, and infections that are associated with chronic diarrhea. X-linked agammaglobulinemia is caused by changes in the BTK gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner."

It becomes apparent at birth, or shortly after birth, with reddening, scaling, and severe blistering of the skin. Blister formation decreases, but may still occur after skin trauma or during summer months. Skin can be itchy and smelly, and prone to infection. Other features may include reduced sweating; nail abnormalities; and in severe cases, growth failure. EI is caused by changes in the KRT1 or KRT10 genes."
Summary of Burn Goodship syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome: Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome (BOS) affects the skin and bones causing skin lesions and spots on the bones. The skin lesions are due to abnormalities in different types of connective tissue. The bone spots are painless areas of increased bone density seen on X-ray. People with BOS may have only skin, only bone or both skin and bone involvement. Rarely, BOS causes melorheostosis, which results in abnormal bone growth and can lead to bone pain and abnormally flexed joints. Symptoms of BOS usually start in childhood. The skin lesions can increase with age, but they do not cause other symptoms. BOS is caused by variations in the LEMD3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination, imaging studies, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."

"Summary of Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy-subcortical infarcts-leukoencephalopath: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy-subcortical infarcts-leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited disease of the blood vessels that occurs when the thickening of blood vessel walls blocks the flow of blood to the brain. The disease primarily affects the small blood vessels in the white matter of the brain. CADASIL is characterized by migraine headaches and multiple strokes, which progresses to dementia. Other symptoms include white matter lesions throughout the brain, cognitive deterioration, seizures, vision problems, and psychiatric problems such as severe depression and changes in behavior and personality. Individuals may also be at higher risk of heart attack. Some individuals may not show signs of the disease until later in life. CADASIL is caused by a variant (or genetic change) in a gene called NOTCH3. Inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Caffey disease: Caffey disease is a bone disorder that most often occurs in babies. It is characterized by the excessive formation of new bone (hyperostosis) in the jaw, shoulder blades, collarbones, and shafts of long bones in the arms and legs. Affected bones may double or triple in width. In some cases, two bones that are next to each other may become fused. Caffey disease is caused by a genetic change in the COL1A1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but not all people who inherit the genetic change develop signs and symptoms. This is due to incomplete penetrance."
"Summary of Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis: Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis is a subtype of systemic sclerosis characterized by the association of Raynaud's phenomenon and skin fibrosis on the hands, face, feet and forearms. The exact cause of Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis is unknown, but likely originates from an autoimmune reaction which leads to overproduction of collagen. In some cases, the condition is associated with exposure to certain chemicals."
Summary of Calloso-genital dysplasia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Calpain-3-related limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R1: Calpain-3-related limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R1 (also known as LGMD2A) is an autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized by progressive, symmetrical weakness of the proximal limb and girdle muscles (mainly those around the hips and shoulders) without heart involvement or intellectual disability. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the CAPN3 gene. LGMD2A is the most common form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, accounting for about 30 percent of cases. LGMD2A is also known as primary calpainopathy. Calpainopathies are diseases caused by genetic changes in the CAPN3 gene and can be autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant. Pelvifemoral limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (also known as Leyden-Mobius LGMD) is the most frequently observed subtype. In these cases, muscle weakness is first evident in the pelvic girdle and later in the shoulder girdle. In most cases, muscle weakness is first evident in the shoulder girdle and later in the pelvic girdle; HyperCKemia is usually observed in children or young individuals. In most cases, those affected do not have symptoms, just high levels of creatine kinase in their blood."
"Summary of X-linked calvarial hyperostosis: X-linked calvarial hyperostosis is a rare, genetic, primary bone dysplasia with increased bone density disorder characterized by benign, isolated, calvarial thickening, presenting with prominent frontoparietal bones, a high forehead with ridging of the metopic and sagittal sutures, lateral frontal prominences, and facial dysmorphism comprising a flat nasal root and short, upturned nose. Increased intracranial pressure and cranial nerve entrapment are not associated. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1986."

"Summary of Camptobrachydactyly: Camptobrachydactyly is an extremely rare brachydactyly syndrome, characterized by short broad hands and feet with brachydactyly associated with congenital flexion contractures of the proximal and/or distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers, as well as syndactyly of feet. Polydactyly, septate vagina and urinary incontinence were also occasionally reported. Camptobrachydactyly has been described in 18 members of 1 family, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1972."
"Summary of Idiopathic camptocormia: The term itself is derived from the Greek ""kamptos"" (to bend) and ""kormos"" (trunk) BSS was initially considered, especially in wartime, as a result of a psychogenic disorder. It is now recognized that in it may also be related to a number of musculo-skeletal or neurological disorders. It seems that myopathy is the primary cause of camptocormia based on electromyography, magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (CT/MRI scans) of paraspinal muscles, and muscle biopsy. Causes of secondary BSS are numerous. Diagnosis of axial myopathy is based upon CT/MRI scans demonstrating a lot of fatty infiltration of paravertebral muscles."

"Summary of Camurati-Engelmann disease: Camurati-Engelmann disease is a genetic condition that mainly affects the bones. People with this disease have increased bone density, particularly affecting the long bones of the arms and legs. In some cases, the skull and hip bones are also affected. The thickened bones can lead to pain in the arms and legs, a waddling walk, muscle weakness, and extreme tiredness. Camurati-Engelmann disease is caused by a genetic change in the TGFB1 gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant. In some cases, people have the genetic change that causes Camurati-Engelmann disease but they never develop symptoms. In others, symptoms are present, but a genetic change cannot be found. These cases are referred to as Camurati-Engelmann disease type 2."
"Summary of Systemic candidiasis: Systemic candidiasis includes a spectrum of yeast infections caused by different species (types) of Candida. It is a serious infection that can affect the blood, heart, brain, eyes, bones, or other parts of the body. Although there are over 200 species of Candida, five different species of Candida cause 90% of Systemic candidiasis. The most common form of this invasive yeast infection is when Candida enters the bloodstream (candidemia). Signs of candidemia include fever and chills that do not improve with antibiotics. Symptoms of other types of Systemic candidiasis depend on the organ or system which is infected. Systemic candidiasis is the most common fungal infection among hospitalized people in high-income countries, including the United States. Diagnosis can be difficult, especially when the Candida is not found in the bloodstream."
"Summary of Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis: Chronic mucocutaneous candidosis (CMC) refers to a group of heterogenous disorders characterized by persistent, debilitating and/or recurrent infections of the skin, nails, and mucus membranes, mainly with the fungal pathogen Candida albicans."

"Summary of Systemic capillary leak syndrome: Systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS) causes fluid and proteins to leak out of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) into surrounding tissues. This may lead to very low blood pressure (hypotension), hypoalbuminemia, and thickened blood due to a decrease in plasma volume (hemoconcentration). Initial symptoms may include tiredness, nausea, abdominal pain, extreme thirst, and sudden increase in body weight. Complications can include general swelling, compartment syndrome, kidney failure, and stroke. SCLS occurs in episodes which vary in frequency, with some people having one episode in their lifetime, and others having several per year. The severity also varies, and the condition can be fatal. In many cases, the cause is not known (idiopathic SCLS). Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical examination and other laboratory tests."
"Summary of Universal acquired melanosis: Universal acquired melanosis, is a rare form of hyperpigmentation. The cause of the condition is unknown."
"Summary of Squamous cell carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common skin cancer. SCC most often affects individuals who are exposed to large amounts of sunlight. It is typically characterized by a red papule or plaque with a scaly or crusted surface; it may be suspected whenever a small, firm reddish-colored skin lesion, growth or bump appears on the skin, but it may also be a flat growth with a curly and crusted surface. Most often these growths are located on the face, ears, neck, hands and/or arms, but they may occur on the lips, mouth, tongue, genitalia or other area. The most common causes of SCC are radiation from the sun and arsenic exposure."
"Summary of Progressive familial heart block, type ia: Progressive familial heart block type I (PFHBI) is a heart condition that is passed down in families. It is classified as a bundle branch disorder which means there are problems with the heart's electrical system. These problems can cause your heart beat to slow or even stop. Symptoms may include shortness of breath (dyspnea), fainting (syncopal episodes), or sudden death. PFHB1 is diagnosed by an electrocardiogram (ECG), which shows changes in the heart's electrical activity. PFHB1A is caused by changes in the SCN5A gene. It follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Cardiac diverticulum: Congenital cardiac diverticulum (CCD) is a very rare congenital malformation characterized by a muscular appendix emerging from the left ventricular apex, rarely from the right ventricle or from both chambers, with clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening hemodynamic collapse."
"Summary of FLNA-related X-linked myxomatous valvular dysplasia: FLNA-related X-linked myxomatous valvular dysplasia is a rare genetic heart condition that affects the mitral valve, which is responsible for regulating blood flow between the heart's left atrium and left ventricle. This condition causes the valve to become thickened and dysfunctional, which can lead to a variety of problems such as narrowing of the valve (stenosis), bulging of the valve (prolapse), and/or leaking of blood back into the atrium (regurgitation). These problems can worsen over time and potentially lead to heart failure. In some patients, this condition can also cause hyperextensible skin and joint hypermobility, which means that the skin and joints may be more flexible than usual. Among people with this disease, males with one altered copy of the gene have been found to have a more severe form of the condition than females with one normal and one altered copy of the gene."

"Summary of Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines: Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines is an inherited condition characterized by abnormalities of the skin, heart, inner ears, and genitalia. There are 3 types of Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, which are distinguished by their genetic cause. Type 1 is caused by genetic changes in the PTPN11 gene; type 2 is caused by genetic changes in the RAF1 gene; and type 3 is caused by genetic changes in the BRAF gene. Other cases are caused by genetic changes in the MAP2K1 gene, and in some cases the cause is unknown. Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. It can be inherited from an affected parent, or it can be due to a new genetic change in a person with no family history of the condition. Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines belongs to a group of related conditions called the RASopathies. These conditions have some overlapping features and are all caused by genetic changes that disrupt the body's RAS pathway, affecting growth and development."
"Summary of Cardiomyopathy-cataract-hip spine disease syndrome: Cardiomyopathy - cataract - hip spine disease describes the extremely rare triad of dilated cardiomyopathy, premature cataract, and articular disease of the hips and spine characterized by hip joint degeneration, irregular intervertebral disks, and platyspondyly. The ocular abnormalities are often the first symptoms to arise. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1985."
Summary of Cardiomyopathy diabetes deafness: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cardiomyopathy, dilated, 1a: Cardiomyopathy, dilated, 1A (CDM1A) is a heart condition where the heart becomes enlarged and weak, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood effectively. It is caused by changes in the LMNA gene. CDM1A is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that a person only needs to inherit one copy of the gene variant from a parent to develop the condition. Symptoms usually present when a person is in their 20s or 30s."
Summary of Cardiomyopathy due to anthracyclines: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cardiomyopathy and deafness due to tRNA lysine gene mutation: A specific change in the MTTK gene causes a condition characterized by weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) and hearing loss. Affected individuals may also have myopathy and ataxia. This genetic change replaces the DNA building block (nucleotide) guanine with the nucleotide adenine at position 8363 (written as G8363A) within the gene. It is unclear how this alteration in the MTTK gene results in cardiomyopathy, hearing loss, and other symptoms."

Summary of Carnevale Hernandez Castillo syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of 3MC syndrome: The term '3MC syndrome' encompasses 4 rare autosomal recessive disorders that were previously designated the Carnevale, Mingarelli, Malpuech, and Michels syndromes, respectively. The main features of these syndromes are facial dysmorphism that includes hypertelorism, blepharophimosis, blepharoptosis, and highly arched eyebrows, which are present in 70 to 95% of cases. Cleft lip and palate, postnatal growth deficiency, cognitive impairment, and hearing loss are also consistent findings, occurring in 40 to 68% of cases. Craniosynostosis, radioulnar synostosis, and genital and vesicorenal anomalies occur in 20 to 30% of cases. Rare features include anterior chamber defects, cardiac anomalies, caudal appendage, umbilical hernia (omphalocele), and diastasis recti (summary by Rooryck et al., 2011).For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of 3MC syndrome, see 3MC1 (257920)."
"Summary of Carney complex: Carney complex is an inherited condition characterized by spotty skin pigmentation, cardiac (heart) myxomas (tumors composed of mucous connective tissue), skin myxomas, endocrine tumors or over-activity, and schwannomas. Some families with this condition have been found to have genetic changes in the PRKAR1A gene. Carney complex is believed to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the genetic change from one affected parent."
"Summary of Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A deficiency: Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency (CPT1A deficiency) is an inherited metabolic condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats (long-chain fatty acids) into energy, particularly during periods without food. Carnitine, a natural substance acquired mostly through the diet, is required by cells to process fats and produce energy. Symptoms of this condition often appear early in life and include low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and low levels of ketones, which are produced when the body breaks down fat for energy (hypoketotic hypoglycemia). This can lead to a greater risk for loss of consciousness or seizures. People with this disorder typically also have an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), muscle weakness, nervous system damage, and elevated levels of carnitine in the blood. CPT1A deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the CPT1A gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency: Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) deficiency is a condition that prevents the body from using certain fats for energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting). There are three main types of CPT2 deficiency: a lethal neonatal form, a severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular form, and a myopathic form. The neonatal and infantile forms are severe multisystemic diseases characterized by liver failure with hypoketotic hypoglycemia (extremely low levels of ketones (substances produced when fat cells break down in the blood) and low blood sugar), cardiomyopathy, seizures, and early death. The myopathic form is characterized by exercise-induced muscle pain and weakness and occasional myoglobinuria (rust-colored urine indicating breakdown of muscle tissue). Genetic changes in the CPT2 gene cause CPT2 deficiency. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency: Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency is a disease that prevents the body from converting certain fats called long-chain fatty acids into energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting).  Carnitine, a natural substance acquired mostly through the diet, is used by cells to process fats and produce energy. People with this disorder have a faulty transporter (CACT) that disrupts carnitine's role in processing long-chain fatty acids. Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency is a type of fatty acid oxidation disorder. Most patients with CACT deficiency have a severe disease presenting within the first 48 hours of life as low blood sugar with ketonic bodies (hypoketotic hypoglycemia), high ammonia (hyperammonemia) levels in the blood, increased heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), and abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmias), as well as skeletal muscle damage, liver problems, and low temperature (hypothermia). Neurological involvement, seizures, and developmental delay are also present. The CACT deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the SLC25A20 gene."

"Summary of Cerebellar ataxia-areflexia-pes cavus-optic atrophy-sensorineural hearing loss s: Cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS) syndrome is a neurological disorder. The syndrome gets its name from the different parts of the body it usually affects: Cerebellar ataxia: inflammation of the cerebellum, the part of the brain that helps control the coordination of muscle movement    Areflexia: loss of reflexes     Pes cavus: high arch in foot    Optic atrophy: damage to the optic nerve of the eye    Sensorinural hearing loss: damage to the nerves involved in hearing   CAPOS syndrome typically begins after a fever-related illness with a sudden episode of ataxia, such as having a hard time walking or coordinating leg or arm movements. The ataxia is usually associated with generalized weakness and/or inflammation of the brain (encephalopathy). Pregnancy and delivery may also trigger episodes. Most people with CAPOS syndrome have one to three episodes during their lifetime. Other signs and symptoms during an episode may include low muscle tone, unusual eye movements (nystagmus or strabismus), problems with speech (dysarthria), difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), reduced or absent reflexes, and hearing loss. Some people may lose consciousness or go into a coma during an episode. Though many of the signs and symptoms of CAPOS syndrome get better as the fever and illness improve, some symptoms, including movement problems, may continue."

"Summary of Autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia: POLG-related disorders comprise a continuum of overlapping phenotypes that were clinically defined long before their molecular basis was known. Most affected individuals have some, but not all, of the features of a given phenotype; nonetheless, the following nomenclature can assist the clinician in diagnosis and management. Onset of the POLG-related disorders ranges from infancy to late adulthood. Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), one of the most severe phenotypes, is characterized by childhood-onset progressive and ultimately severe encephalopathy with intractable epilepsy and hepatic failure. Childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS) presents between the first few months of life and about age three years with developmental delay or dementia, lactic acidosis, and a myopathy with failure to thrive. Other findings can include liver failure, renal tubular acidosis, pancreatitis, cyclic vomiting, and hearing loss. Myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia (MEMSA) now describes the spectrum of disorders with epilepsy, myopathy, and ataxia without ophthalmoplegia. MEMSA now includes the disorders previously described as spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy (SCAE). The ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS) includes the phenotypes previously referred to as mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) and sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO). About 90% of persons in the ANS have ataxia and neuropathy as core features. Approximately two thirds develop seizures and almost one half develop ophthalmoplegia; clinical myopathy is rare. Autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (arPEO) is characterized by progressive weakness of the extraocular eye muscles resulting in ptosis and ophthalmoparesis (or paresis of the extraocular muscles) without associated systemic involvement; however, caution is advised because many individuals with apparently isolated arPEO at the onset develop other manifestations of POLG-related disorders over years or decades. Of note, in the ANS spectrum the neuropathy commonly precedes the onset of PEO by years to decades. Autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) typically includes a generalized myopathy and often variable degrees of sensorineural hearing loss, axonal neuropathy, ataxia, depression, parkinsonism, hypogonadism, and cataracts (in what has been called \""chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia plus,\"" or \""CPEO+\"")."
Summary of Subacute cerebellar degeneration: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cerebellar hypoplasia: Cerebellar hypoplasia is a neurological condition in which the cerebellum is not completely developed or is smaller than it should be. It may occur with a variety of congenital syndromes, metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative disorders; therefore signs and symptoms may depend upon the associated condition an affected individual has. The most common findings are developmental and speech delay, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), ataxia and abnormal ocular (eye) movements. Cerebellar hypoplasia may range from mild or partial underdevelopment to complete absence (agenesis). It may affect only the cerebellum, or also affect other central nervous system structures. The inheritance pattern may differ depending on the underlying cause of the condition."
"Summary of Endosteal sclerosis-cerebellar hypoplasia syndrome: Endosteal sclerosis-cerebellar hypoplasia syndrome is characterized by congenital cerebellar hypoplasia, endosteal sclerosis, hypotonia, ataxia, mild to moderate developmental delay, short stature, hip dislocation, and tooth eruption disturbances. It has been described in four patients. Less common manifestations are microcephaly, strabismus, nystagmus, optic atrophy, and dysarthria. It is appears to be transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait."

It presents with early developmental delay, central and peripheral non-progressive visual impairment or asymptomatic retinal changes, hypotonia, non-progressive ataxia and nystagmus."
Summary of Cerebello-olivary atrophy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autosomal recessive cerebelloparenchymal disorder type 3: The disorders involving primarily the cerebellar parenchyma have been classified into six forms. In cerebelloparenchymal disorder III, cerebellar ataxia is congenital (non-progressive) and characterized by cerebellar symptoms such as incoordination of gait often associated with poor coordination of hands, speech and eye movements. The other features are congenital mental retardation and hypotonia, in addition to other neurological and non-neurological features. MRI or CT scan show marked atrophy of the vermis and hemispheres. A severe loss of granule cells with heterotopic Purkinje cells is observed. The mode of inheritance in the few reported families is autosomal recessive. In one family, cerebellar ataxia was associated to albinism.: In a large inbred Lebanese family the disease locus was assigned to a 12.1-cM interval on chromosome 9q34-qter between markers D9S67 and D9S312. The primary biochemical defect remains unknown. Up to now, the only treatment has consisted in early interventional therapies including intensive speech therapy and adequate stimulation and/or training."

"Summary of Cerebral gigantism jaw cysts: Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is characterized by the development of multiple jaw keratocysts, frequently beginning in the second decade of life, and/or basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) usually from the third decade onward. Approximately 60% of individuals have a recognizable appearance with macrocephaly, frontal bossing, coarse facial features, and facial milia. Most individuals have skeletal anomalies (e.g., bifid ribs, wedge-shaped vertebrae). Ectopic calcification, particularly in the falx, is present in more than 90% of affected individuals by age 20 years. Cardiac and ovarian fibromas occur in approximately 2% and 20% of individuals respectively. Approximately 5% of all children with NBCCS develop medulloblastoma (primitive neuroectodermal tumor), generally the desmoplastic subtype. The risk of developing medulloblastoma is substantially higher in individuals with an SUFU pathogenic variant (33%) than in those with a PTCH1 pathogenic variant (<2%). Peak incidence is at age one to two years. Life expectancy in NBCCS is not significantly different from average."

"Summary of Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic manifestatio: Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy and systemic manifestations (RVCL-S) affects the small blood vessels in the central nervous system and other organs. Symptoms begin in adulthood and can include loss of vision, Raynaud's disease, kidney and liver disease, and cognitive problems that get worse over time. Other symptoms may include migraines, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hypothyroidism. RVCL-S is caused by genetic variations in the TREX1 gene, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, imaging studies of the brain, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of CLN10 disease: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 10 (CLN10 disease) is a type of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a group of severe diseases that affect the nervous system. Signs and symptoms of CLN10 usually appear soon after birth. They may include muscle stiffness, respiratory failure, and seizures that last several minutes (status epilepticus). Infants with CLN10 disease have a small brain and small head (microcephaly). They also have problems controlling their movements. The areas of the brain involved in thinking and emotions are also severely affected. In some cases, people with CLN10 disease do not develop symptoms until later in infancy, childhood, or adulthood. Symptoms in these cases may be more gradual and include ataxia, loss of speech and vision, and problems with memory and thinking (cognitive impairment). The lifespan of people diagnosed after early infancy is also shortened, but varies based on when their symptoms began. CLN10 disease is caused by changes in the CTSD gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. If the disease-causing genetic change completely prevents the CLN10 protein (cathepsin D) from being made, the infant will be born with the severe type. If however, some working CLN2 protein is made, the person will develop either the late infantile, juvenile, or adult type."

"Summary of CLN4B disease: CLN4B disease (autosomal dominant neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 4B) is a form of adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, which is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Signs and symptoms usually begin around age 30, but they can develop anytime between adolescence and late adulthood. Affected people generally experience behavioral abnormalities, dementia; difficulties with muscle coordination (ataxia); and involuntary movements such as tremors or tics. It can be caused by changes in the DNAJC5 or CTSF gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of CLN5 disease: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 5 (CLN5-NCL) is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Affected people may experience loss of muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures that do not respond to medications, muscle twitches (myoclonus), visual impairment, and cognitive/motor decline. It occurs predominantly in the Finnish population. CLN5-NCL is caused by changes in the CLN5 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of CLN6 disease: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 6 (CLN6-NCL) is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Affected people may experience loss of muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures that do not respond to medications, muscle twitches (myoclonus), visual impairment, and developmental regression (loss of previously acquired skills). It occurs predominantly in people of Portuguese, Indian, Pakistani, or Czech ancestry. CLN6-NCL is caused by changes in the CLN6 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Cervical hypertrichosis-peripheral neuropathy syndrome: Cervical hypertrichosis peripheral neuropathy is a rare syndrome characterized by the association of congenital hypertrichosis in the anterior cervical region with peripheral sensory and motor neuropathy. It has been described in three members of the same family and in one unrelated boy. Associated features in the familial cases include retinal anomalies, spina bifida, kyphoscoliosis and hallux valgus, while that in the non-familial case includes developmental delay.

Summary of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is a type of inherited neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nerves. People with this disease experience weakness and wasting (atrophy) of the muscles of the lower legs beginning in adolescence; later they can also have hand weakness and sensory loss. CMT1A is caused by having an extra copy (a duplication) of the PMP22 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
"Summary of Autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A1: Autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A1 is a type of nerve disease that affects the way muscles work. It causes weakness in the arms and legs, but it's usually worse in the legs. There may also be shaking when standing or sitting."
"Summary of X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1X) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the GJB1 gene. Symptoms usually start during childhood. The condition affects a person's peripheral nerves, which are the nerves that branch out from the spinal cord. CMT1X is characterized by a decrease in size and strength (atrophy) of the hands and lower limbs that gets worse over time. These symptoms start at the tips of the fingers and toes and progress inwards towards the center of the body. People with CMTX1 also have high-arched feet. CMTX1 causes difficulty lifting the front part of the feet (bilateral foot drop), and reduced reflexes. In some cases, people may also experience mild to moderate sensory loss in their lower legs and feet. They may have hearing loss, and issues with their brain and spine. CTMX1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. While both males and females may be affected, females typically have milder symptoms (and some may not have any symptoms at all)."
"Summary of Charlie M syndrome: Charlie M syndrome is a rare bone developmental disorder which belongs to a group of oromandibular limb hypogenesis syndromes that includes hypoglossia-hypodactyly and glossopalatine ankylosis (see these terms). The major anomalies which occur commonly in this group are hypoplasia of the mandible, syndactyly and ectrodactyly, small mouth, cleft palate, hypodontia, and facial paralysis. Patients with Charlie M syndrome also present with hypertelorism, absent or conically crowned incisors, and variable degrees of hypodactyly of the hands and feet.

"Summary of Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is characterized by inflammation in the bile ducts (cholangitis) that leads to scarring (sclerosis), narrowing of the ducts, and a buildup of bile in the liver. Early signs and symptoms include extreme tiredness, abdominal pain, and itchiness. Other complications may include weight loss, vitamin deficiency, and osteoporosis. Many people with PSC develop other autoimmune conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, or thyroid disease. PSC is also a risk factor for cancer of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma)."
"Summary of Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2: Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC2) is a rare condition that affects the liver. People with this condition generally develop signs and symptoms during infancy, which may include severe itching, jaundice, failure to thrive, portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the vein that provides blood to the liver) and hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen). Affected people also have an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (a form of liver cancer). PFIC2 is caused by change in the ABCB11 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3: Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a rare condition that affects the liver. People with this condition generally develop signs and symptoms during late infancy or early childhood, which may include severe itching, jaundice, failure to thrive, portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the vein that provides blood to the liver) and hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen). The condition may progress to liver failure during childhood or adulthood. PFIC3 is caused by change in the ABCB4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition: Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition (or chondrocalcinosis 2) is a rare disease characterized by the accumulation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) crystals in and around the joints. Signs and symptoms of the disease include chronic joint pain or sudden, recurrent episodes of pain, as well as stiffness or swelling of the joints. Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition is a familial form of chondrocalcinosis (also known as calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease or CPPD), which is caused by a similar buildup of CPP crystals but is associated with the aging process. Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition is caused by changes in the ANKH gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition is diagnosed based on imaging such as X-rays. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing of the ANKH gene."
"Summary of Brachytelephalangic chondrodysplasia punctata: Brachytelephalangic chondrodysplasia punctata (also known as chondrodysplasia punctata 1, X-linked recessive or CDPX1) is a genetic disorder present from birth that affects bone and cartilage development. On x-ray, infants with CDPX1 have characteristic spots at the ends of their bones. These spots are called chondrodysplasia punctata or stippled epiphyses. Additional common features of CDPX1 are shortened fingers and a flattened nose. Some people with this condition have breathing abnormalities, hearing loss, abnormalities of the spinal bones in the neck, and intellectual delays. CDPX1 is caused by genetic changes in the ARSE gene, which is located on the X chromosome. This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner and occurs almost exclusively in males."

Other signs and symptoms may include polydactyly; missing and/or malformed nails; dental abnormalities; and congenital heart defects. More than half of people affected by Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome have changes in the EVC or EVC2 genes; the cause of the remaining cases is unknown. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
"Summary of Chondrodysplasia punctata, humero-metacarpal type: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Chordoma: A Chordoma is a rare tumor that develops from cells of the notochord, a structure that is present in the developing embryo and is important for the development of the spine. The notochord usually disappears before birth, though a few cells may remain embedded in the bones of the spine or at the base of the skull. About half of all Chordomas occur at the bottom of the spine (sacrum); about one third occur at the base of the skull. The remaining cases of Chordomas form in the spine at the level of the neck, chest, or other parts of the lower back. Chordomas grow slowly, extending gradually into the surrounding bone and soft tissue. The actual symptoms depend on the location of the Chordoma. A Chordoma that occurs at the base of the spine may cause problems with bladder and bowel function. A Chordoma at the base of the skull may lead to double vision and headaches. In many cases, the cause of the Chordoma remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that changes in the T gene have been associated with Chordomas in a small set of families. In these families an inherited duplication of the T gene is associated with an increased risk of developing a Chordoma. Duplications of the T gene have also been identified in people with Chordoma who have no history of the tumor in their family, but in these cases the changes occur only in the tumor cells and are not inherited."
"Summary of Benign hereditary chorea: Benign hereditary chorea (BHC) is a rare movement disorder that begins in infancy or childhood. Signs and symptoms in infants may include low muscle tone, involuntary movements (chorea), lung infections, and respiratory distress. Signs and symptoms in children may include delayed motor and walking milestones, jerky muscle movements (myoclonus), upper limb dystonia, motor tics, and vocal tics. The chorea often improves with time. Children with BHC can have normal intellect, but may have learning and behavior problems. Other signs and symptoms include thyroid problems (e.g., hypothyroidism) and lung disease (e.g., recurring infections). BHC is caused by genetic changes in the NKX2-1 gene (also known as the TITF1 gene). It is passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion."

"Summary of Chromomycosis: Chromomycosis is a chronic fungal infection characterized by raised and crusted lesions which affect the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It most often occurs on the limbs, but can affect any area of the body. Chromomycosis is caused by several fungi found in soil, wood, and decaying plant material. It usually enters the skin through a minor injury such as a splinter. It is most common in areas with tropical and subtropical climates."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 1 syndrome: Ring chromosome 1 syndrome is an autosomal anomaly characterized by variable clinical features, most commonly including significant intrauterine and postnatal growth failure, developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and dysmorphic facial features. Some less frequent clinical features are dysgenesis of corpus callosum, atrial septal defect, rocker bottom feet and clinodactyly."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 10 syndrome: An autosomal anomaly characterized by variable clinical features, depending on the size and precise location of deleted chromosome segments. Most patients present with developmental delay, intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly, clinodactyly, and dysmorphic features. Congenital heart disease and genitourinary anomalies were reported in some cases."
"Summary of Distal monosomy 10p: Distal monosomy 10p is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing (deleted) copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 10. The severity and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features may affect many parts of the body and may include low birth weight, growth delay, developmental delay, low muscle tone (hypotonia), and communication difficulties. Birth defects, various medical problems, and/or distinctive facial features may also be present. Most 10p deletions are not inherited and occur randomly during the formation of egg or sperm cells, or very early in fetal development. Some 10p deletions are present because a parent has a rearrangement of genetic material on his/her chromosomes. This rearrangement is usually a balanced translocation, which typically does not cause any health problems. In some cases, a parent has the same deletion as the child. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide information about whether the deletion was inherited."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 12 syndrome: Ring chromosome 12 syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with a highly variable phenotype principally characterized by postnatal growth retardation, variable degrees of developmental delay and intellectual disability, microcephaly and facial dysmorphism (incl. epicanthal folds, low-set, cupped ears, prominent nose with flat nasal bridge, high arched palate, micrognathia). Skeletal abnormalities (e.g. pectus excavatum, clinodactyly), congenital heart malformations, cryptorchidism, cafÃ©-au-lait spots and epilepsy have also been reported."
"Summary of Mosaic trisomy 14: Mosaic trisomy 14 is a rare chromosomal disorder in which there are 3 copies (trisomy) of chromosome 14 in some cells of the body, while other cells have the usual two copies. The extent and severity of features in affected individuals can vary. Signs and symptoms that have been most commonly reported include intrauterine growth restriction; failure to to thrive; developmental delay; intellectual disability; distinctive facial characteristics; structural malformations of the heart; and other physical abnormalities. This condition is most often caused by an error in cell division in the egg or sperm cell before conception, or in fetal cells after fertilization."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 15 syndrome: Ring chromosome 15 is a chromosome abnormality that affects growth, learning, and speech. People with Ring chromosome 15 often have growth delays before and after birth, resulting in short stature; varying degrees of intellectual disability; low muscle tone (hypotonia); craniofacial malformations; and limb abnormalities. Other symptoms might include congenital heart defects, kidney problems, congenital dislocation of the hips, and cafe-au-lait spots. Ring chromosome 15 is caused by an abnormal chromosome known as a Ring chromosome 15 or r(15). A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the broken ends fuse together. The features of Ring chromosome 15 appear to result from the loss (deletion) of genetic material from the long (q) arm of chromosome 15. Ring chromosome 15 is usually caused by spontaneous (de novo) errors very early in embryonic development. In rare cases, it is passed through families, either from a parent who also has a Ring chromosome 15, or from a parent who has a balanced translocation."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 19 syndrome: Ring chromosome 19 syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with a highly variable phenotype that may range from normal to patients with profound intellectual disability, developmental delay, learning disability (esp. speech) and mild dysmorphism (incl. micro/macrocephaly, prominent forehead, low-set and posteriorly rotated ears, hypertelorism, high nasal bridge, prominent philtrum, retro/micrognathia). Mild hypotonia and autistic-like mannerisms (e.g. hand opening and closing, head banging) may also be associated. Other anomalies, such as cutis laxa, hearing loss, syndactyly, digital hypoplasia, and talipes equinovarus, have also been reported."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 20 syndrome: People with Ring chromosome 20 often have recurrent seizures or epilepsy. Other symptoms might include intellectual disability, behavioral difficulties, growth delay, short stature, a small head (microcephaly), and characteristic facial features. Ring chromosome 20 is caused by an abnormal chromosome known as a Ring chromosome 20 or r(20). A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together. Ring chromosome 20 is usually not inherited. It almost always occurs by chance during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 22 syndrome: Ring chromosome 22 is a rare condition caused by having an abnormal chromosome 22 that forms a ring. In this chromosome abnormality, a segment on the short (p) arm and a segment on the long (q) arm of 22 are missing. The amount of material lost varies from person to person. The remaining ends of chromosome 22 have joined together to make a ring shape. Chromosome 22 is an acrocentric chromosome, meaning that the centromere is near one end, creating a very small short (p) arm that does not contain genes that are relevant to development. Thus, only the lost genes on the long (q) arm matter. Knowing the breakpoint in the long arm is likely more helpful. Most cases are sporadic (happen by chance) and occur in people with no history of the condition in their family."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 4 syndrome: Ring chromosome 4 syndrome is an autosomal anomaly characterized by variable clinical features, most commonly including significant intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and dysmorphic facial features. Some less frequent features are cleft lip and/or cleft palate, congenital cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and genitourinary system anomalies."
"Summary of Chromosome 4q deletion: Chromosome 4q deletion is a chromosome abnormality that affects many different parts of the body. People with this condition are missing genetic material located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 4 in each cell. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary based on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Common features shared by many people with this deletion include distinctive craniofacial features, skeletal abnormalities, heart defects, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and short stature. Most cases are not inherited, although affected people can pass the deletion on to their children."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 7 syndrome: Ring chromosome 7 syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome, with highly variable phenotype, principally characterized by growth failure, short stature, intellectual disability, dermatological abnormalities (nevus flammeus, dark pigmented nevi, cafÃ©-au-lait spots), microcephaly and facial dysmorphism (incl. facial asymmetry, small ears, abnormal palpebral fissures, ptosis, epicanthic folds, hyper/hypotelorism). Additional reported features include convulsions, cleft lip and palate, clinodactyly, kyphoscoliosis and genital anomalies (i.e. cryptorchidism, hypospadias, micropenis)."
"Summary of Chromosome 7p deletion: Chromosome 7p deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 7. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 7p deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 8 syndrome: Chromosome 8-derived supernumerary ring/marker is a rare chromosomal anomaly comprising variable parts of chromosome 8. The phenotype of mosaic or non-mosaic supernumerary r(8)/mar(8) ranges from almost normal to variable degrees of minor abnormalities, and growth and mental retardation overlapping with the well-known mosaic trisomy 8 syndrome (see this term)."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 9 syndrome: Ring chromosome 9 is a very rare chromosome abnormality in which the ends of chromosome 9 join together to form a ring shape. The resulting ring may be missing genes, or it may contain extra copies of genes. Therefore, the severity and symptoms associated with Ring chromosome 9 vary from person to person. Signs and symptoms that may be present in a person with Ring chromosome 9 include slow growth and short stature, learning disabilities, small head size, distinctive facial features, low muscle tone (hypotonia), skeletal abnormalities, and/or other birth defects involving various parts of the body. However, people with Ring chromosome 9 can be generally healthy and have no major birth defects. Ring chromosome 9 typically is not inherited and occurs sporadically, during the formation of egg or sperm cells or shortly after the egg and sperm join together. Occasionally, one of the parents has a chromosome abnormality involving chromosome 9. Chromosome testing of both parents can help determine whether the ring chromosome was inherited and whether future children have an increased chance to have a chromosome abnormality."

"Summary of Cogan syndrome: Cogan syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the eyes and inner ears. Symptoms of the syndrome include irritation and pain in the eyes, decreased vision, hearing loss, and vertigo. Other symptoms may include joint or muscle pain or inflammation of the blood vessels. The exact cause of Cogan syndrome is not well-understood. It is thought that the syndrome is caused by an autoimmune response that causes the immune system to attack the tissues of the eyes and ears. Cogan syndrome is not known to run in families. Diagnosis of Cogan syndrome is based on observing symptoms associated with the syndrome and ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms."

"Summary of Congenital adrenal hyperplasia: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) refers to a group of genetic conditions that affect the adrenal glands. These glands sit on top of the kidneys and are responsible for releasing various types of hormones that the body needs to function. Affected people lack an enzyme the adrenal glands need to make one or more of these hormones and often overproduce androgens (male hormones such as testosterone). For example, females with a severe form of the condition may have ambiguous genitalia at birth and if not properly diagnosed, develop dehydration, poor feeding, diarrhea, vomiting and other health problems soon after. People with milder forms may not be diagnosed with the condition until adolescence or adulthood when they experience early signs of puberty or fertility problems."

"Summary of Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy: Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a hereditary disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. This condition affects the retina, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye, by preventing blood vessels from forming at the edges of the retina. This reduces the blood supply to retina. The signs and symptoms include vision loss or blindness, retinal detachment, strabismus, and a visible whiteness (leukocoria) in the normally black pupil. The severity of FEVR varies widely, even within the same family. Many people with this condition do not experience any vision problems.FEVR has different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved. Most individuals have the autosomal dominant form of this condition, caused by genetic changes in the FZD4 or LRP5 gene. FEVR caused by LRP5 genetic changes can also have an autosomal recessive inheritance. When this condition is caused by genetic changes in the NDP gene, it has an X-linked pattern of inheritance."

"Summary of Split cord malformation type I: Split spinal cord malformation type 1 (SSCM-1) is a rare form of spinal dysraphism in which a person is born with splitting, or duplication, of the spinal cord. It may be characterized by complete or incomplete division of the spinal cord, resulting in two 'hemicords.' Each hemicord has a full protective covering (thecal sac) and they are separated by a bony structure, forming a double spinal canal. While SSCM-1 is present from birth, it may become apparent at any age and is more common in women than in men. Some people may not have symptoms, while others may have a tethered cord and/or various other spinal abnormalities. Symptoms vary and may include back pain, bladder dysfunction, and leg pain or weakness. SSCM-1 is thought to be caused by abnormal formation of the notochord and neural tube (which ultimately form the brain and spinal cord) very early in embryonic development."

Summary of Die Smulders Vles Fryns syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Diethylstilbestrol syndrome: Diethylstilbestrol syndrome (DES syndrome) refers to developmental or health problems caused by exposure to DES before birth (in utero), such as reproductive tract differences, infertility, and an increased risk for certain cancers. DES is a synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women between about 1940 and 1971 to prevent miscarriage and premature labor. DES also may have been prescribed to women to inhibit lactation, as hormone replacement therapy for menopause symptoms, and as a post-coital emergency contraceptive ('morning-after pill'). It was first thought to be safe and effective, but studies later found that DES was not effective in preventing pregnancy complications, and caused health problems in some children of mothers exposed during pregnancy, as well as some of the women exposed during pregnancy or for other reasons. It is important to note that not all people exposed to DES have health problems due to the exposure. Females exposed to DES in utero may have reproductive tract differences affecting the uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix, and/or vagina. Examples include incomplete development of the uterus or cervix, a differently-shaped uterus or cervix, and a transverse vaginal septum. These differences may increase the risk of infertility. Females exposed to DES in utero also are more likely to experience various pregnancy complications including ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, and preterm birth. However, most have healthy babies. Additionally, females exposed in utero are at increased risk to develop cancers such as vaginal or cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma, squamous cervical cancer, and breast cancer. Males exposed to DES in utero have not been studied as extensively as females, but may be at increased risk for epididymal cysts, undescended testes, and inflammation or infection of the testicles. Males exposed to DES do not appear to have an increased risk of infertility. Of note, women exposed to DES after birth (those exposed while they were pregnant or those exposed for other reasons) have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. The children of women exposed to DES in utero (grandchildren of mothers exposed during pregnancy) may also have an increased risk for cancer, as well as higher infertility rates. Women who took DES during pregnancy or for other reasons are encouraged to inform their doctors and children of the exposure, and children exposed in utero should inform their doctors so they can be monitored for possible health problems that may arise."

Symptoms typically begin in late childhood and include vomiting, dehydration, low blood pressure, especially upon standing (orthostatic hypotension), and low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). Low blood pressure can also cause dizziness, blurred vision, and difficulty exercising. Other symptoms may include drooping eyelids (ptosis), nasal congestion, muscle pain, and weakness. Dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency is caused by genetic change in the DBH gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis is based on blood tests showing high dopamine levels and low norepinephrine levels."
"Summary of Subcortical band heterotopia: Subcortical band heterotopia, also known as double cortex syndrome, is a condition of abnormal brain development that is present from birth. This condition which primarily affects females, occurs when neurons migrate to an area of the brain where they are not supposed to be (heterotopia), and form abnormal areas that appear as band-like clusters of white tissue underneath the gray tissue of the cerebral cortex (subcortical), creating the appearance of a double cortex. Symptoms associated with Subcortical band heterotopia vary from severe intellectual disability and epilepsy to normal intelligence with mild or no epilepsy. Subcortical band heterotopia is most often caused by genetic changes in the DCX gene. The condition is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. Some cases may be caused by a small deletion on chromosome 17 involving the LIS1 gene."

Summary of Chromosome 11q duplication: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Chromosome 12q duplication: Chromosome 12q duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 12. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 12q duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, growth delay, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the duplication on to their children."
"Summary of Chromosome 13q duplication: Chromosome 13q duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra (duplicated) copy of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 13. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 13q duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the duplication was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation, where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a duplication."
"Summary of Duplication of urethra: Duplication of urethra is a very rare condition where there is an extra urethra, instead of the normal one. Urethral duplications can be classified into three types: incomplete urethral duplication (type 1), complete urethral duplication (type 2), and urethral duplication as a result of two bladdersThe urethra is the tube that connects the urinary bladder to the genitals for the removal of fluids from the body.

"Summary of Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia is a hereditary disease that affects the production of red blood cells (erythropoiesis) and is characterized by anemia and problems in various organs. The signs and symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), larger-than-normal liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and problems of the heart. There are four major types of the condition. Each type has a different cause and the additional signs and symptoms mentioned below: Type 1: Characterized by moderate to severe anemia; jaundice; hepatosplenomegaly; and iron overload, which can lead to heart problems, liver disease (cirrhosis), and diabetes. Some people are born with skeletal defects of the fingers and/or toes. In some cases, the disease can be detected before birth as a hydrops fetalis. It is usually caused by changes in the CDAN1 and C15orf41(less frequently) genes. Type 2: Characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, gallbladder stones, and a milder form of anemia. It is caused by genetic changes in the SEC23B gene    Type 3: The rarest form of the types. The liver is unaffected, but eye and blood problems (monoclonal gammopathy) are present. The exact cause of this type is currently unknown but it likely results from genetic changes in a gene located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at a position designated 15q22. Type 4: Characterized by very severe anemia. It is caused by genetic changes in the KLF1 gene. Types 1 and 2 are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Type 3 appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Type 4 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type 1 is an inherited blood disorder characterized by moderate to severe anemia. It is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, although in some cases, the condition can be detected before birth. Many affected individuals have yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). This condition also causes the body to absorb too much iron, which builds up and can damage tissues and organs. In particular, iron overload can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). Rarely, people with CDA type I are born with skeletal abnormalities, most often involving the fingers and/or toes. CDA type I usually results from genetic changes in the CDAN1 (about 90% of the cases) and C150RF41 genes (about 1% of the cases). In about 9% of the cases no cause can be identified. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type 2 (CDA II) is an inherited blood disorder characterized by mild to severe anemia. It is usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood. Many affected individuals have yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) and gallstones. This condition also causes the body to absorb too much iron, which builds up and can damage tissues and organs. In particular, iron overload can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). Rarely, people with CDA type II have mediastinal tumors. CDA type II usually results from genetic changes in the SEC23B gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III (CDA III) is a rare form of CDA (see this term) characterized by dyserythropoiesis, with big multinucleated erythroblasts in the bone marrow, and manifesting with mild to moderate anemia."
"Summary of Qualitative or quantitative defects of dysferlin: The diseases in the group are: All dysferlinopathies are caused by pathogenic variations in the DYSF gene which result in a deficiency of the protein dysferlin (hence, the name), important for the efficient repair of muscle fibers. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Familial dysfibrinogenemia: Dysfibrinogenemia is a coagulation (clotting) disorder characterized by having an abnormal form of fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is a protein produced by the liver which helps control bleeding by helping blood clots to form. Having abnormal fibrinogen results in defective clot formation and can cause an increased or decreased ability to clot. Dysfibrinogenemias may be inherited (congenital) or acquired. Congenital Dysfibrinogenemia is rare. About 40% of people with this form have no symptoms. About 50% have a bleeding disorder, and the remaining 10% have either a thrombotic disorder (excessive clotting) or both bleeding and thrombotic disorders. Congenital Dysfibrinogenemias may be caused by genetic changes in the FGA, FGB or FGG genes. Inheritance is most often autosomal dominant or codominant, but can also be autosomal recessive. Whether a person has no symptoms, a bleeding tendency, or an increased risk of thrombosis depends on the effect of their specific genetic change(s). Acquired Dysfibrinogenemia is more common than the congenital form and is associated with liver disease such as cirrhosis, liver tumors, or hepatitis."
Summary of Extragonadal germinoma: A germinoma that arises from the pineal gland.

The classic symptoms include abnormal skin coloring, nail abnormalities, and white patches in the mouth. People with this disorder have short telomeres (the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes), which can cause bone marrow failure. Bone marrow failure is the main cause of early death in people with this disorder. Other symptoms can include lung problems, liver problems, hair loss, osteoporosis, and learning difficulties. Men may also have testicular problems. People with dyskeratosis congenita are more likely to develop cancer. X-linked dyskeratosis congenita is caused by changes in the DKC1 gene. It follows an x-linked pattern of inheritance. There are different types of dyskeratosis congenita, and some are more severe than others."

"Summary of Dyssegmental dysplasia and glaucoma: The dyssegmental dysplasias are lethal forms of neonatal short-limbed dwarfism. Handmaker et al. (1977) coined the term 'dyssegmental dysplasia' because of the marked differences in size and shape of the vertebral bodies (anisospondyly), which he attributed to errors in segmentation. Fasanelli et al. (1985) proposed that there are different forms of dyssegmental dwarfism, a lethal Silverman-Handmaker type (224410) and a less severe Rolland-Desbuquois type. The Rolland-Desbuquois form is lethal in about 40% of patients. Although many patients survive beyond the newborn period, all exhibit neonatal distress (summary by Hennekam et al., 2010)."
"Summary of Dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type: Dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type is a rare, genetic, primary bone dysplasia disorder, and lethal form of neonatal short-limbed dwarfism, characterized by anisospondyly, severe short stature and limb shortening, metaphyseal flaring and distinct dysmorphic features (i.e. flat facial appearance, abnormal ears, short neck, narrow thorax). Additional features may include other skeletal findings (e.g. joint contractures, bowed limbs, talipes equinovarus) and urogenital and cardiovascular abnormalities."
"Summary of Early-onset generalized limb-onset dystonia: This is the most common hereditary form of dystonia. Symptoms start in one part of the body (usually an arm, foot, or leg) and are usually first apparent with actions such as writing or walking. With time, the contractions may spread to other parts of the body, causing the muscles to twist the body into unnatural positions. Symptoms can vary greatly, even among members of the same family. For some, the disorder can cause significant disability, while others may experiences only isolated writer's cramp. It is thought that only 30% of individuals who inherit the genetic change will develop DYT1 dystonia. This is known as reduced penetrance ."

"Summary of Autosomal dominant hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia: Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is characterized by hypotrichosis (sparseness of scalp and body hair), hypohidrosis (reduced ability to sweat), and hypodontia (congenital absence of teeth). The cardinal features of classic HED become obvious during childhood. The scalp hair is thin, lightly pigmented, and slow-growing. Sweating, although present, is greatly deficient, leading to episodes of hyperthermia until the affected individual or family acquires experience with environmental modifications to control temperature. Only a few abnormally formed teeth erupt, and at a later-than-average age. Physical growth and psychomotor development are otherwise within normal limits. Mild HED is characterized by mild manifestations of any or all the characteristic features."

"Summary of Blepharo-cheilo-odontic syndrome: Blepharocheilodontic (BCD) syndrome is a disorder that is present at birth. It mainly affects the eyelids (blepharo-), upper lip (-cheilo-), and teeth (-dontic).People with BCD syndrome have lower eyelids that turn out so that the inner surface is exposed (ectropion). The outside of the lower lid may sag away from the eye (euryblepharon), and the eyelids may not be able to close completely (lagophthalmia). There can be extra eyelashes (distichiasis) on the upper eyelids, ranging from a few extra eyelashes to a full extra set. These eyelashes do not grow along the edge of the eyelid with the normal lashes, but out of its inner lining. When the abnormal eyelashes touch the eyeball, they can cause damage to the clear covering of the eye (cornea). Affected individuals may also have widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a flat face, and a high forehead.Other features of BCD syndrome usually include openings on both sides of the upper lip (bilateral cleft lip) and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Affected individuals may have fewer teeth than normal (oligodontia) and their teeth are often smaller than usual and cone-shaped. The dental abnormalities affect both primary teeth (sometimes called \""baby teeth\"") and secondary (permanent) teeth. Other frequent features include sparse, fine hair and abnormal nails.Occasionally people with BCD syndrome have additional features, including an obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus); malformation or absence of the butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck called the thyroid, resulting in lack of thyroid gland function; or fused fingers or toes (syndactyly).

It can occur at any age, but typically is found in adulthood."
"Summary of Ethylmalonic encephalopathy: Ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) causes damage to the brain, nerves, and blood vessels. Symptoms are present at birth and tend to get worse over time. These include low muscle tone, spasms of the arms and legs, seizures, and developmental delay. Blood vessel damage causes tiny red spots under the skin (petechiae) and blue discoloration in the hands and feet due to reduced blood flow (acrocyanosis). Chronic bloody diarrhea and difficulty swallowing leads to poor growth. Ethylmalonic encephalopathy is caused by a variant in the ETHE1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

These growths are capped by cartilage and can cause deformities in the legs, forearms, and hands. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that a person only needs to inherit one copy of the mutated gene from one parent to develop the condition. Exostoses, multiple, type 1 is caused by gene variants in the EXT1 gene."
"Summary of Exostoses, multiple, type ii: The disorder hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO), previously called hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), is characterized by growths of multiple osteochondromas (benign cartilage-capped bone tumors that grow outward from the metaphyses of long bones). Osteochondromas can be associated with a reduction in skeletal growth, bony deformity, restricted joint motion, shortened stature, premature osteoarthrosis, and compression of peripheral nerves. The median age of diagnosis is three years; nearly all affected individuals are diagnosed by age 12 years.

"Summary of Exstrophy-epispadias complex: Exstrophy-epispadias complex (EEC) refers to a spectrum of birth defects that includes epispadias, classical bladder exstrophy, and exstrophy of the cloaca and several variants. EEC is characterized by a visible defect of the lower abdominal wall and other problems. In normal development, the cloacal membrane temporarily separates the cloaca (final part of the intestine) into urogenital and anal regions, and it ruptures after fusing with a structure known as the urogenital septum, which is made up of the tissue that will form the abdominal muscles (mesoderm). If the cloacal membrane does not fuse correctly with the urogenital septum, it does not form the mesoderm and, as a result, the abdominal muscles do not form. The exact timing of the rupture determines whether the child is born with isolated epispadias, classic bladder exstrophy, or cloacal exstrophy. Depending on severity, EEC may involve the urinary system, musculoskeletal system, pelvis, pelvic floor, abdominal wall, genitalia, and sometimes the spine and anus. There is no known cause for EEC. The University of Michigan has a webpage about the development of the embryo and its parts, including the formation of the cloaca."

"Summary of Faciocardiorenal syndrome: A very rare syndrome characterized by intellectual deficit, horseshoe kidney, and congenital heart defects."
"Summary of Congenital factor V deficiency: Congenital factor V deficiency is an inherited bleeding disorder that prevents blood clots from forming properly. This disorder is caused by genetic changes in the F5 gene, which leads to a deficiency of a protein called coagulation factor V. The reduced amount of factor V may lead to nosebleeds, easy bruising, and excessive bleeding following surgery or trauma. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This condition should not be confused with Factor V Leiden thrombophilia, a genetic risk factor for blood clots."
"Summary of Congenital factor VII deficiency: Congenital factor VII deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder. While severe cases may become apparent in infancy, very mild cases may never cause any bleeding problems. Signs and symptoms may include nosebleeds; easy bruising; bleeding gums; excessive or prolonged bleeding after injury or surgery; and heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding in women. Some people with congenital factor VII deficiency may have bleeding in the joints or blood in the urine. In very severe cases, congenital factor VII deficiency can cause bleeding inside the skull or digestive tract. Congenital factor VII deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the F7 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Tetralogy of Fallot: Tetralogy of Fallot is a complex congenital heart defect characterized by a large ventricular septal defect (hole between the right and left ventricles), pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the valve and artery that connect the heart with the lungs), an overriding aorta (the aorta - the artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the body - is shifted over the right ventricle and ventricular septal defect, instead of coming out only from the left ventricle), and right ventricular hypertrophy (the muscle of the right ventricle is thicker than usual). Tetralogy of Fallot causes low oxygen levels in the blood, which can lead to cyanosis (a bluish-purple color to the skin). The cause of this condition is unknown."
"Summary of Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection: Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection (Familial TAAD) is a rare condition that affects the aorta (the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body). In people affected by this condition, the thoracic aorta (the upper part of the aorta, near the heart) may become weakened, stretched and/or enlarged. This can lead to a sudden tear of the inner wall of the aorta that allows blood to flow between the aorta's inner and outer walls (also called a dissection). These aortic abnormalities can be serious as they can decrease blood flow to other parts of the body and/or cause the aorta to rupture. Familial TAAD can be caused by changes in several different genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."

"Summary of Non-acquired combined pituitary hormone deficiency: Combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) in man denotes impaired production of growth hormone (GH; 139250) and one or more of the other 5 anterior pituitary hormones. Mutations of the POU1F1 gene in the human and Pit1 in the mouse are responsible for pleiotropic deficiencies of GH, prolactin (PRL; 176760), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; see 188540), while the production of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH; see 176830), luteinizing hormone (LH; 152780), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; 136530) are preserved (Wu et al., 1998). In infancy severe growth deficiency from birth as well as distinctive facial features with prominent forehead, marked midfacial hypoplasia with depressed nasal bridge, deep-set eyes, and a short nose with anteverted nostrils and hypoplastic pituitary gland by MRI examination can be seen (Aarskog et al., 1997). Some cases present with severe mental retardation along with short stature (Radovick et al., 1992).Genetic Heterogeneity of Combined Pituitary Hormone DeficiencyCPHD2 (262600), associated with hypogonadism, is caused by mutation in the PROP1 gene (601538). CPHD3 (221750), which is associated with rigid cervical spine and variable sensorineural deafness, is caused by mutation in the LHX3 gene (600577). CPHD4 (262700) is caused by mutation in the LHX4 gene (602146). CPHD5 (see septooptic dysplasia, 182230) is caused by mutation in the HESX1 gene (601802). CPHD6 (613986) is caused by mutation in the OTX2 gene (600037)."
"Summary of Familial nasal acilia: Familial nasal acilia is a rare genetic otorhinolaryngologic disease characterized by respiratory morbidity due to lack of cilia on the respiratory tract epithelial cells.

"Summary of Polydactyly of an index finger: Polydactyly of an index finger or PPD3 is a form of preaxial polydactyly of fingers (see this term), a limb malformation syndrome, where the thumb is replaced by one or two triphalangeal digits with dermatoglyphic pattern specific of the index finger. Two forms of PPD3 have been characterized: unilateral and bilateral (see these terms). There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1962."
"Summary of Autosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features: Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF) is a rare form of epilepsy, a condition that is characterized by recurrent seizures. In ADPEAF, specifically, most affected people experience secondary generalized seizures and partial seizures, some of which are associated with sound-related symptoms (such as buzzing, humming, or ringing) and/or receptive aphasia (inability to understand written or spoken words). Less commonly, seizures may cause visual hallucinations, a disturbance in the sense of smell, vertigo, or other symptoms affecting the senses. Signs and symptoms of the condition generally begin in adolescence or early adulthood. ADPEAF is caused by changes in the LGI1 or RELN gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Familial porencephaly: Familial porencephaly is part of a group of conditions called the COL4A1-related disorders. The conditions in this group have a range of signs and symptoms that involve fragile blood vessels. In familial porencephaly, fluid-filled cysts develop in the brain (porencephaly) during fetal development or soon after birth. These cysts typically occur in only one side of the brain and vary in size. The cysts are thought to be the result of bleeding within the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). People with this condition also have leukoencephalopathy, which is a change in a type of brain tissue called white matter that can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).During infancy, people with familial porencephaly typically have paralysis affecting one side of the body (infantile hemiplegia). Affected individuals may also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), migraine headaches, speech problems, intellectual disability, and uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia). Some people are severely affected, and others may have no symptoms related to the brain cysts."
"Summary of Familial supernumerary nipples: Familial supernumerary nipples are a common, minor birth defect that consists of an extra nipple (and/or related tissue) in addition to the two nipples that normally appear on the chest. Most Supernumerary nipples do not cause symptoms or complications. They often are small and go undetected. Sometimes they are first noticed during puberty, menstruation, or pregnancy when hormonal changes affect breast tissue. They can be present with no other tissue (polythelia); with some related tissue; or with breast tissue and ducts (then referred to as polymastia). They are usually located along areas of the body known as the ""embryonic milk lines,"" the lines of potentially appearing breast tissue. The embryonic milk lines extend on both sides of the body from slightly above the armpit, down the chest and abdomen, to the inner thighs near the groin."
Summary of Familial ventricular tachycardia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Fanconi-Bickel syndrome: Fanconi Bickel syndrome (FBS) is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of a substance called glycogen in different parts of the body. Glycogen is created when the body needs to store glucose (sugar). When the body needs sugar again, glycogen is transformed back into glucose for use. People with Fanconi Bickel syndrome do not store the appropriate amount of glycogen. Therefore, Fanconi Bickel syndrome is known as a glycogen storage disease. Specifically, glycogen accumulates in the liver and kidneys. Signs and symptoms begin in the first few months of life and include growing slower than expected (failure to thrive), excessive urination (polyuria), and weakened bones (rickets). Later in life, children may have short stature and a swollen liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Fanconi Bickel syndrome is caused by genetic changes to the SLC2A2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis of FBS is based on a clinical examination that shows signs of FBS. The condition can be confirmed by genetic testing."

There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1983."
"Summary of Fetal akinesia syndrome, x-linked: Fetal akinesia syndrome, x-linked is a rare genetic condition that affects movement and development of fetuses. It mostly affects males. The condition can cause too much amniotic fluid around the baby and reduced movement. The brain development and facial features of babies with this syndrome may also be severely affected. Some babies may not survive or may die shortly after birth. This condition is caused by one gene on the X chromosome being different."
"Summary of Aminopterin/methotrexate embryofetopathy: A syndrome of developmental anomalies characterized by growth deficiency, facial dysmorphism and skull, limb and neural defects secondary to maternal exposure to aminopterin or methotrexate (MTX) during pregnancy."
"Summary of Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia: Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) is a blood disorder that affects pregnant women and their babies. NAIT was first reported in the literature in 1953 and is estimated to occur in as many as 1 in 1200 live births. NAIT results in the destruction of platelets in the fetus or infant due to a mismatch between the mother's platelets and those of the baby. Certain molecules (antigens) on the surface of the baby's platelets are recognized as foreign by the mother's immune system. The mother's immune system then creates antibodies that attack and destroy the baby's platelets. Though NAIT can occur whenever the mother's blood mixes with that of the baby, it is usually triggered when the mother is exposed to the baby's blood during delivery. Many cases of NAIT are mild. Signs and symptoms may include a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and signs of bleeding into the skin such as petechiae and purpura. In the most severe cases, NAIT can cause bleeding episodes that may result in death or long-term disability. Bleeding episodes can occur either during pregnancy or after birth."

"Summary of Fetal iodine syndrome: Fetal iodine syndrome refers to symptoms and signs that may be observed in a fetus or newborn when the mother was exposed during pregnancy to inappropriate (insufficient or excessive) amounts of iodine. Iodine deficiency is associated with goiter and hypothyroidism. When severe iodine deficiency occurs during pregnancy, it is associated with congenital hypothyroidism that is manifested by increased neonatal morbi-mortality and severe mental dysfunction, hyperactivity, attention disorders and a substantial decrease of IQ of an irreversible nature. Excessive iodine ingestion during the third trimester of pregnancy can result in hypothyroidism and fetal goiter due to a prolonged inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis, an increase in thyrotropin (TSH)."
"Summary of Congenital left ventricular aneurysm: Congenital left ventricular aneurysm is a rare heart condition that some people are born with. It is characterized by a bulging of the left ventricular wall, which is connected to the left ventricle by a wide neck. The size of the aneurysm can range from 0.5 cm to 8x9 cm, and it is most commonly found in the left ventricular apex (the bottom of the left ventricle) and the perivalvular area (around the heart valves). Aneurysms can have different types of movement. They can be a- or dyskinetic, which means they lack movement or move abnormally, or they can show almost normal movement. Some people with this condition may not have any symptoms, while others may experience systemic embolization (blockage of a blood vessel), congestive heart failure, valvular regurgitation (blood leaks backward when valves don't close correctly), ventricular wall rupture, ventricular tachycardia (overly fast heartbeat), or sudden stopping of the heart."
"Summary of Fetal minoxidil syndrome: Fetal minoxidil syndrome is a group of symptoms that may be found in a newborn when a mother has taken minoxidil (Loniten) during pregnancy. Minoxidil is a medication that can be used to treat hypertension (increased blood pressure) and alopecia (hair loss). A few cases of maternal use of minoxidil have been published in the medical literature with findings of neonatal (newborn) hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth) that gradually resolves during the first six months of life. Other symptoms have been reported, such as congenital heart defects; neurodevelopmental anomalies; and gastrointestinal, kidney, and limb malformations. More studies are needed to determine the potential risks to the fetus during pregnancy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides safety information on minoxidil."

People with FG syndrome type 1 frequently have intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe, hypotonia, constipation and/or anal anomalies, a distinctive facial appearance, broad thumbs and great toes, a large head compared to body size (relative macrocephaly), and abnormalities of the corpus callosum. Medical problems including heart defects, seizures, undescended testicle, and an inguinal hernia have also been reported in some affected individuals. FG syndrome type 1 is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Individualized early intervention and educational services are important so that each child can reach their fullest potential."
Summary of Congenital fibrinogen deficiency: Congenital fibrinogen deficiency is a condition that affects the blood's ability to clot properly causing mild to severe bleeding symptoms. This condition is a result of a reduced quantity and/or quality of circulating fibrinogen (a type of blood protein). Afibrinogenemia refers to a complete absence of fibrinogen in the blood. Hypofibrinogenemia refers to a reduced amount of fibrinogen in the blood. Dysfibrinogenemia refers to when the fibrinogen in the blood does not work properly. Hypodysfibrinogenemia occurs when hypofibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia occur together.
"Summary of Fibrochondrogenesis: Fibrochondrogenesis is a rare, neonatally lethal, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia. Eleven cases have been reported. The face is distinctive and characterized by protuberant eyes, flat midface, flat small nose with anteverted nares and a small mouth with long upper lip. Cleft palate, micrognathia and bifid tongue can occur. The limbs show marked shortness of all segments with relatively normal hands and feet. No internal anomalies other than omphalocele have been reported. Transmission is probably autosomal recessive. Recurrence in a consanguineous family (affecting both sexes) and concordance of affected male twins have been reported."
"Summary of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome: Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHDS) is a rare, complex, genetic disorder with three main clinical findings: non-cancerous (benign) skin tumors; lung cysts and/or history of pneumothorax (collapsed lung); and various types of renal tumors. Fibrofolliculomas are a type of benign skin tumor specific to BHDS. They typically occur on the face, neck, and upper torso. Most people with BHDS also have multiple cysts in both lungs that can be seen on high-resolution chest CT scan. While these cysts usually do not cause any symptoms, they put people at increased risk for spontaneous pneumothorax. BHDS is caused by genetic changes in the FLCN gene. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."
"Summary of Gingival fibromatosis-hypertrichosis syndrome: Gingival fibromatosis with hypertrichosis is a genetic condition that can cause profound overgrowth of hair and gums, as well as other variable features. Signs and symptoms may be present from birth or begin in later childhood to adolescence. The historical figure, Julia Pastrana and her infant son, likely had this syndrome. The underlying cause of Gingival fibromatosis with hypertrichosis is unknown, but speculated to involve a heritable contiguous gene deletion. Gingival fibromatosis with hypertrichosis can be inhertied from an affected parent or occur for the first time in a family due to a new (spontaneous) genetic change in the affected person. An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance has been demonstrated in individual families. The signs and symptoms of Gingival fibromatosis with hypertrichosis overlap with a number of other gum overgrowth syndromes, such as Laband syndrome, juvenile hyaline fibromatosis and Jones syndrome. Improved understanding regarding the cause, will likely aid in distinguishing these syndromes in the future."

"Summary of FRAXE intellectual disability: FRAXE intellectual disability is a genetic condition associated with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities with physical features differing from person to person. The characteristic features are learning difficulties, often a consequence of communication problems (speech delay, poor writing skills), hyperactivity, and a shortened attention span. Nearly all cases of FRAXE intellectual disability are caused by a specific type of genetic change, called a trinucleotide repeat expansion, in the AFF2 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. A trinucleotide repeat expansion occurs when there is an abnormally large number of repeats of a specific sequence of three nucleotides (building block of DNA) within our DNA. The repeating nucleotides in FRAXE intellectual disability are CCG. When the number of CCG repeats is over 200, people typically have the signs and symptoms seen in FRAXE intellectual disability. FRAXE intellectual disability is inherited in an X-linked manner."
"Summary of Osteochondrosis of the metatarsal bone: Osteochondrosis of the metatarsal bone is rare condition that primarily affects the second or third metatarsal (the long bones of the foot). Common signs and symptoms include pain and stiffness in the front of the foot, which often leads to a limp. Affected people may also experience swelling, limited range of motion, and tenderness of the affected foot. Symptoms are generally triggered by weight-bearing activities, including walking. The exact underlying cause of osteochondrosis of the metatarsal bone is currently unknown."
"Summary of Odontotrichomelic syndrome: Odontotrichomelic syndrome is a very rare ectodermal dysplasia affecting the hair, teeth, and nails and all four extremities.

"Summary of Frontonasal dysplasia: Frontonasal dysplasia is a rare disease that results from abnormal development of the head and face before birth. Symptoms often vary, however more common symptoms include wide spaced eyes, a widow's peak, and a broad nose. Less common features include eye abnormalities, missing the connection between the two halves of the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum), hearing loss, and undescended testicles in males (cryptorchidism). Most people with the dysplasia have normal intelligence. There are three main types of Frontonasal dysplasia that are distinguished by their genetic causes and symptoms. Other Frontonasal dysplasia syndromes have also been described. Frontonasal dysplasia is very rare, with around 100 cases reported in the literature. Type 1 Frontonasal dysplasia is caused by genetic changes (changes) in the ALX3 gene, type 2 is caused by genetic changes in the ALX4 gene, and type 3 is caused by genetic changes in the ALX1 gene. Type 1 and type 3 Frontonasal dysplasia are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, whereas Frontonasal dysplasia type 2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Diagnosis is often first suspected when a baby has features consistent with Frontonasal dysplasia. X-rays and genetic testing may be used to confirm the diagnosis."

"Summary of Fused mandibular incisors: Fused manidbular incisors is an extremely rare dental anomaly that is characterized by the union of two, normally separated, incisor tooth germs of the primary dentition. It is frequently associated with hypodontia (see this term) and an increased risk of pulp exposure."
"Summary of Galactokinase deficiency: Galactokinase deficiency (GALK), a mild type of galactosemia, is an inherited disorder that impairs the body's ability to process and produce energy from a simple sugar called galactose. If babies with GALK eat foods containing galactose, undigested sugars build up in the blood. Galactose is present in many foods, including all dairy products, many baby formulas, and some fruits and vegetables. Rarely, a child with GALK will have pseudotumor cerebri, a condition which mimics the symptoms of a large brain tumor when no brain tumor is present. This is thought to be caused by increased pressure in the brain from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) due to elevated levels of a galactose product in the CSF. The serious medical problems that occur with ""classic"" galactosemia (type 1), such as liver, kidney, and brain damage, typically are not present in people with GALK. GALK is caused by genetic changes in the GALK1 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. The disorder may be suspected in babies with an abnormal newborn screening result, or in babies with cataracts. The diagnosis can be confirmed with biochemical and molecular genetic testing."
"Summary of Galactosemia: Galactosemia, which means 'galactose in the blood,' refers to a group of inherited disorders that impair the body's ability to process and produce energy from a sugar called galactose. When people with Galactosemia injest foods or liquids containing galactose, undigested sugars build up in the blood. Galactose is present in many foods, including all dairy products (milk and anything made from milk), many baby formulas, and some fruits and vegetables. The impaired ability to process galactose can be due to the deficiency of any of 3 enzymes, caused by genetic changes in different genes. Genetic changes in the three genes cause different severity and types of symptoms.  Inheritance of all types of Galactosemia is autosomal recessive. The diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms or results of newborn screening tests, and can be confirmed by measuring enzyme activity and genetic testing."
"Summary of Growth delay-hydrocephaly-lung hypoplasia syndrome: Growth delay - hydrocephaly - lung hypoplasia, also named Game-Friedman-Paradice syndrome, is a rare developmental disorder described in 4 sibs so far and characterized by delayed fetal growth, hydrocephaly with patent aqueduct of Sylvius, underdeveloped lungs and various other anomalies such as small jaw, intestinal malrotation, omphalocele, shortness of lower limbs, bowed tibias and foot deformities."

"Summary of Gamma-sarcoglycan-related limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R5: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (LGMD2C) is a genetic condition that affects the voluntary muscles around the hips and shoulders. This condition belongs to a group of muscle disorders called limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, which are characterized by progressive loss of muscle bulk and symmetrical weakening of voluntary muscles. Symptoms may additionally include: enlargement (hypertrophy) of the calf muscle and tongue, diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), and respiratory abnormalities. LGMD2C is caused by genetic changes in the SGCG gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Ganglioglioma: A Ganglioglioma is a rare type of brain tumor, accounting for approximately 1% of all brain tumors. Gangliogliomas occur when a single cell in the brain starts to divide into more cells, forming a tumor. This can occur when the cell randomly acquires changes in genes that regulate how a cell divides. Most Gangliogliomas grow slowly and are considered benign. However, up to 10% of Gangliogliomas may grow more rapidly and become malignant, meaning the tumor affects the surrounding brain tissue."
"Summary of GM1 gangliosidosis type 3: GM1 gangliosidosis is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder that progressively destroys nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord. The condition may be classified into three major types based on the general age that signs and symptoms first appear: classic infantile (type 1); juvenile (type 2); and adult onset or chronic (type 3). Although the types differ in severity, their features may overlap significantly. GM1 gangliosidosis is caused by genetic changes in the GLB1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of X-linked Alport syndrome-diffuse leiomyomatosis: A rare renal disease characterized by the association of X-linked Alport syndrome (glomerular nephropathy, sensorineural deafness and ocular anomalies) and benign proliferation of visceral smooth muscle cells along the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and female genital tracts and clinically manifests with dysphagia, dyspnea, cough, stridor, postprandial vomiting, retrosternal or epigastric pain, recurrent pneumonia, and clitoral hypertrophy in females."
Summary of Garret Tripp syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Ménétrier disease: Menetrier disease is a gastrointestinal condition characterized by overgrowth of the mucous cells (foveola) in the mucous membrane lining the stomach, causing enlarged gastric folds. This leads to excessive mucus production, causing protein loss from the stomach and low or absent levels of stomach acid. Symptoms may include pain in the upper middle region of the stomach, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The cause of Menetrier disease is largely not known, although some cases are associated with infection, particularly pediatric cases, which can be caused by CMV infections."

"Summary of Gaucher disease type 1: Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) is the most common form of Gaucher disease. Like other types of Gaucher disease, GD1 is caused when not enough glucocerebrosidase (GBA) is made. GBA is an important enzyme that breaks down a fatty chemical called glucocerebroside. Because the body cannot break down this chemical, fat-filled Gaucher cells build up in areas like the spleen, liver and bone marrow. Unlike type 2 and 3, GD1 does not usually involve the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Symptoms of GD1 include enlarged spleen and liver, low blood cell counts, bleeding problems and bone disease. The symptoms can range from mild to severe and may appear anytime from childhood to adulthood. Gaucher disease is caused by changes in the GBA gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis is suspected by clinical symptoms and confirmed by measuring GBA enzyme activity or genetic testing."
"Summary of Gaucher disease type 2: Gaucher disease type 2 is an inherited metabolic disorder in which harmful quantities of a fatty substance called glucocerebroside accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and brain. Symptoms usually develop by 3 months of age and include brain damage, seizures, abnormal eye movements, poor ability to suck and swallow, and enlargement of the liver and spleen. Gaucher disease type 2 is caused by genetic changes in the GBA gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Gaucher disease type 3: Gaucher disease type 3 is the subacute neurological form of Gaucher disease (GD; see this term) characterized by progressive encephalopathy and associated with the systemic manifestations (organomegaly, bone involvement, cytopenia) of GD type 1 (see this term)."

"Summary of Gemignani syndrome: Gemignani syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by slowly progressive ataxia, amyotrophy of the hands and distal arms, spastic paraplegia, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, hypogonadism and short stature. Additional features include generalized cerebellar atrophy and peripheral nervous system anomalies. Small cervical spinal cord, intellectual/language disability and localized vitiligo have also been reported. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1989."
"Summary of Glaucoma-ectopia lentis-microspherophakia-stiff joints-short stature syndrome: Glaucoma-ectopia-microspherophakia-stiff joints-short stature syndrome is characterized by progressive joint stiffness, glaucoma, short stature and lens dislocation. It has been described in three members of a family (the grandfather, his daughter and grandson). It is likely to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. The acronym GEMSS (Glaucoma, Ectopia, Microspherophakia, Stiff joints, Short stature) was proposed as a name for the syndrome. This syndrome shows similarities to Moore-Federman syndrome (see this term)."
"Summary of Holoprosencephaly-craniosynostosis syndrome: Holoprosencephaly-craniosynostosis syndrome is a rare condition that primarily affects the brain and skull. Babies with this condition are generally born with semilobar holoprosencephaly, a disorder caused by failure of the developing brain to sufficiently divide into the double lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. They later develop craniosynostosis (the premature closure of one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of the skull before brain growth is complete). Holoprosencephaly-craniosynostosis syndrome also appears to be associated with other skeletal abnormalities, including those of the hands, and distinctive facial features. The underlying genetic cause of the condition is currently unknown. Some reports suggest that Holoprosencephaly-craniosynostosis syndrome may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Genetic reflex epilepsy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Genital dwarfism: Turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition that affects development in females. The most common feature of Turner syndrome is short stature, which becomes evident by about age 5. An early loss of ovarian function (ovarian hypofunction or premature ovarian failure) is also very common. The ovaries develop normally at first, but egg cells (oocytes) usually die prematurely and most ovarian tissue degenerates before birth. Many affected girls do not undergo puberty unless they receive hormone therapy, and most are unable to conceive (infertile). A small percentage of females with Turner syndrome retain normal ovarian function through young adulthood.About 30 percent of females with Turner syndrome have extra folds of skin on the neck (webbed neck), a low hairline at the back of the neck, puffiness or swelling (lymphedema) of the hands and feet, skeletal abnormalities, or kidney problems. One third to one half of individuals with Turner syndrome are born with a heart defect, such as a narrowing of the large artery leaving the heart (coarctation of the aorta) or abnormalities of the valve that connects the aorta with the heart (the aortic valve). Complications associated with these heart defects can be life-threatening.Most girls and women with Turner syndrome have normal intelligence. Developmental delays, nonverbal learning disabilities, and behavioral problems are possible, although these characteristics vary among affected individuals."

Summary of Ghose Sachdev Kumar syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Large congenital melanocytic nevus: A large congenital melanocytic nevus is a dark-colored, often hairy patch of skin that is present at birth (congenital). It grows proportionally to the child. A congenital melanocytic nevus is considered large if by adulthood it measures more than 20cm (about 8 inches) in diameter. Large congenital melanocytic nevi can occur in people of any racial or ethnic background and on any area of the body. They result from localized genetic changes in the fetus that lead to excessive growth of melanocytes, the cells in the skin that are responsible for skin color. People with large congenital melanocytic nevi may have no other symptoms or may have several symptoms such as fragile, dry, or itchy skin. In about 5% to 10% of the cases the large congenital melanocytic nevus is associated with neurocutaneous melanocytosis (excess pigment cells in the brain or spinal cord) and is characterized by neurological symptoms. They also have an increased risk of developing malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer, especially if the nevus is localized in the vertebral column or when there are multiple associated lesions (satellites)."

"Summary of Fibromatosis, gingival, 2: Fibromatosis, gingival, 2 is a condition where the gums in the mouth slowly become larger over time. It can be passed down through families, though the specific underlying genetic cause is not known."
"Summary of Fibromatosis, gingival, 4: Fibromatosis, gingival, 4 is a condition where the gums in a patient's mouth grow too much and cover their teeth. This can make it hard to brush and floss one's teeth. It can be passed down through families, though the specific underlying genetic cause is not known."
"Summary of Glanzmann thrombasthenia: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare inherited blood clotting disorder that is present at birth. It is characterized by the impaired function of specialized blood cells, called platelets, that are essential for proper blood clotting. Signs and symptoms vary greatly from person to person. Symptoms usually include abnormal bleeding, which can be severe. Other symptoms may include easy bruising, nose bleeds, bleeding from the gums, and/or heavy menstrual bleeding. Rarely, internal bleeding and blood in the urine (hematuria) can occur. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is caused by genetic changes in either the ITGA2B or ITGB3 genes."

Summary of Glaucoma type 1C: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Congenital glaucoma: Congenital glaucoma is a rare eye condition that causes high pressure inside the eye. This can make the eye bigger and cause swelling in the clear part of the eye called the cornea.
"Summary of Pediatric-onset glaucoma of genetic origin: Pediatric-onset glaucoma of genetic origin is a rare group of eye disorders that occur when a person has a genetic predisposition (increased likelihood of developing a particular disease because of their genetic make-up). It causes high pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure or IOP), which can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss and blindness. There are two types of pediatric-onset glaucoma: primary and secondary. Primary glaucoma occurs in isolation, while secondary glaucoma is found along with with other eye or systemic health problems. The symptoms of pediatric-onset glaucoma can vary depending on the person's age, the severity of the glaucoma, whether there are other eye problems present, and development of other complications based on the  increased IOP."

Symptoms include photophobia, blepharospasm, and excessive tearing. Typically, the diagnosis is made in the first year of life. Depending on when treatment is instituted, visual acuity may be reduced and/or visual fields may be restricted. In untreated individuals, blindness invariably occurs."
"Summary of Glioblastoma: Glioblastoma is a malignant (cancerous) brain tumor that develops from a specific type of brain cell called an astrocyte. These cells help support and nourish neurons (nerve cells of the brain) and form scar tissue that helps repair brain damage in response to injury. Glioblastomas are often very aggressive and grow into surrounding brain tissue. Signs and symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting and/or drowsiness, may develop when the tumor begins to put excess pressure on the brain. Affected people may also experience other features depending on the size and location of the tumor. In most cases, the exact underlying cause is unknown; however, they can rarely occur in people with certain genetic syndromes such as neurofibromatosis type 1, Turcot syndrome and Li Fraumeni syndrome."
"Summary of Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia-renal defect syndrome: Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia-renal defect syndrome is a genetic condition that affects children and gets worse over time. It has four main features: hair loss (hypotrichosis), swelling in the arms and legs (lymphedema), small red spots on the skin (telangiectasia), and problems with the kidneys (renal defect). This condition is caused by a variant in the SOX18 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that a person only needs to inherit one altered gene in order to develop the condition."
Summary of Glossopalatine ankylosis micrognathia ear anomalies: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Glucagonoma: A usually malignant, glucagon-producing neuroendocrine tumor arising from the pancreatic alpha cells.

Summary of Glucose-6-phosphate translocase deficiency: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Glucosephosphate isomerase deficiency: Glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. People with this disorder have a condition known as chronic hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Chronic hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). An enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), an excess of iron in the blood, and small pebble-like deposits in the gallbladder or bile ducts (gallstones) may also occur in this disorder.Hemolytic anemia in GPI deficiency can range from mild to severe. In the most severe cases, affected individuals do not survive to birth. Individuals with milder disease can survive into adulthood. People with any level of severity of the disorder can have episodes of more severe hemolysis, called hemolytic crises, which can be triggered by bacterial or viral infections.A small percentage of individuals with GPI deficiency also have neurological problems, including intellectual disability and difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia)."
"Summary of Glucosidase acid-1,4-alpha deficiency: Glucosidase acid-1,4-alpha deficiency, also known as Pompe disease, is classified by age of onset, organ involvement, severity, and rate of progression. Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD; individuals with onset before age 12 months with cardiomyopathy) may be apparent in utero but more typically onset is at the median age of four months with hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness, feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, respiratory distress, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Without treatment by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), IOPD commonly results in death by age two years from progressive left ventricular outflow obstruction and respiratory insufficiency. Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD; including: (a) individuals with onset before age 12 months without cardiomyopathy; and (b) all individuals with onset after age 12 months) is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency; clinically significant cardiac involvement is uncommon."
Summary of Glutamate decarboxylase deficiency: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to hepatic glycogen synthase deficiency: Glycogen storage disease due to hepatic glycogen synthase deficiency (GSD type 0a), a form of glycogen storage disease (GSD), is a rare abnormality of glycogen metabolism (how the body uses and stores glycogen, the storage form of glucose). Unlike other types of GSD, liver GSD type 0a does not involve excessive or abnormal glycogen storage, and causes moderately decreased glycogen stores in the liver. Symptoms typically begin in infancy or in early childhood and may include drowsiness, sweating, lack of attention, fasting hypoglycemia associated with hyperketonemia, seizures, and other findings. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glycogen synthetase in the liver, due to genetic changes in the GYS2 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency type Ib: Glycogen storage disease due to glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency type Ib (GSD type IB) is an inherited condition in which the body is unable to break down a complex sugar called glycogen. As a result, glycogen accumulates in cells throughout the body. In GSD type IB, specifically, glycogen and fats build up within the liver and kidneys which can cause these organs to be enlarged and not function properly. Signs and symptoms of the condition generally develop at age 3 to 4 months and may include hypoglycemia, seizures, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia (high levels of a waste product called uric acid in the body), and hyperlipidemia. Affected people may also have short stature; thin arms and legs; a protruding abdomen; neutropenia (which may lead to frequent infections); inflammatory bowel disease and oral health problems. GSD type IB is caused by changes in the SLC37A4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to glycogen branching enzyme deficiency: Glycogen storage disease due to glycogen branching enzyme deficiency (GSD type 4) is part of a group of disorders which lead to abnormal accumulation of glycogen (a storage form of glucose) in various parts of the body. Symptoms of GSD type 4 usually begin in infancy and typically include failure to thrive; enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly); and in many cases, progressive liver cirrhosis and liver failure. In rare cases individuals may have a form with non-progressive liver disease, or a severe neuromuscular form. GSD type 4 is caused by genetic changes in the GBE1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Sandhoff disease: Sandhoff disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by an accumulation of GM2 gangliosides, particularly in neurons, and is clinically indistinguishable from Tay-Sachs disease (272800)."
"Summary of GM2-gangliosidosis, B, B1, AB variant: Hexosaminidase A deficiency results in a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by intralysosomal storage of the specific glycosphingolipid, GM2 ganglioside. The prototype hexosaminidase A deficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, also known as the acute infantile variant. Tay-Sachs disease is characterized by progressive weakness, loss of motor skills, decreased attentiveness, and increased startle response beginning between ages three and six months with progressive evidence of neurodegeneration including: seizures, blindness, spasticity, eventual total incapacitation, and death, usually before age four years. The juvenile (subacute), chronic, and adult-onset variants of hexosaminidase A deficiency have later onsets, slower progression, and more variable neurologic findings, including: progressive dystonia, spinocerebellar degeneration, motor neuron disease, and, in some individuals with adult-onset disease, a bipolar form of psychosis."
"Summary of GMS syndrome: GMS syndrome describes an extremely rare syndrome involving goniodysgenesis, intellectual disability and short stature in addition to microcephaly, short nose, small hands and ears, and that has been seen in one family to date.

"Summary of XY type gonadal dysgenesis-associated anomalies syndrome: An association syndrome described only once in two sisters. They had a 46,XY karyotype, cleft lip and palate, preauricular pits and a 'squashed down' appearance because of a short columella and small nares. Other anomalies included broad hands and feet, and a hypermuscular appearance. Cardiac, renal, musculoskeletal and ectodermal anomalies were also present. Ectodermal defects included 'punched out scalp defects' and unusual positioning of hair whorls. They also had short stature, streak gonads, and mild developmental delay."
"Summary of Perrault syndrome: Perrault syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by sensorineural hearing loss in males and females, and abnormalities of the ovaries in females. Neurological problems may also occur. The condition has several genetic causes. Genetic changes in the following genes have been found in a small number of affected individuals: C10orf2, CLPP, HARS2, LARS2, or HSD17B4. It is likely that other genes are also involved. Perrault syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both copies of the gene in each cell have genetic changes. The condition should be managed by a team of specialists, including an audiologist and otolaryngologist for hearing loss, an endocrinologist for primary amenorrhea, and a reproductive specialist for issues related to infertility."
"Summary of Gonococcal conjunctivitis: A rare disorder of the anterior segment of the eye caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, characterized by a severe mucopurulent conjunctivitis associated with lid edema, often also with localized lymphadenopathy. It may be complicated by uveitis or keratitis which can eventually lead to corneal perforation. The disease most often occurs in teenagers and young adults with a male predominance, while infections are much less common in newborns, where they are typically bilateral."
"Summary of Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease: Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (anti-GBM disease) is an autoimmune disease that affects the lungs and kidneys and is characterized by pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage (bleeding in the lungs) and a kidney disease known as glomerulonephritis. Some use the term ""Goodpasture syndrome"" for the findings of glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage and the term ""Goodpasture disease"" for those patients with glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and anti-GBM antibodies. Currently, the preferred term for both conditions is anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. Circulating antibodies are directed against the collagen of the part of the kidney known as the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), resulting in acute or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Antibodies also attack the collagen of the air sacs of the lung (alveoli) resulting in bleeding of the lung (pulmonary hemorrhage). Symptoms may include general body discomfort or pain, bleeding from the nose and/or blood in the urine, respiratory problems, anemia, chest pain, and kidney failure. Anti-GBM disease is thought to result from an environmental insult (smoking, infections, exposure to certain drugs) in a person with genetic susceptibility, such as a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. Diagnosis is confirmed with the presence of anti-GBM antibody in the blood or in the kidney."
"Summary of Gordon syndrome: Gordon syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder that affects movement in the joints of the upper and lower limbs, also known as distal arthrogryposis. People with this disorder can be born with several fingers fixed in a flexed position (camptodactyly), clubfoot, and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Their joints are often very stiff or unable to move. Intelligence is usually normal. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from person to person. Gordon syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the PIEZO2 gene and can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Gordon syndrome is diagnosed by clinical examination and genetic testing."

"Summary of Gray platelet syndrome: Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by platelets that have a gray appearance, severe thrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis, and splenomegaly. About 60 cases from various populations around the world have been described in the literature to date. GPS results from the absence or reduction of alpha-granules in platelets, which store proteins that promote platelet adhesiveness and wound healing when secreted during an injury. GPS is caused by genetic changes in the NBEAL2 gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Griscelli syndrome type 1: Griscelli syndrome type 1 (GS1) represents hypomelanosis with a primary neurologic deficit and without immunologic impairment or manifestations of hemophagocytic syndrome (Menasche et al., 2002). Griscelli syndrome with immune impairment, or Griscelli syndrome type 2 (607624), is caused by mutation in the RAB27A gene (603868). Griscelli syndrome type 3 (609227), characterized by hypomelanosis with no immunologic or neurologic manifestations, can be caused by mutation in the melanophilin (MLPH; 606526) or MYO5A genes.Griscelli syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that results in pigmentary dilution of the skin and hair, the presence of large clumps of pigment in hair shafts, and an accumulation of melanosomes in melanocytes. While most patients also develop hemophagocytic syndrome, leading to death in the absence of bone marrow transplantation (Menasche et al., 2000), some show severe neurologic impairment early in life without apparent immune abnormalities. Bahadoran et al. (2003) characterized GS1 as comprising hypomelanosis and severe central nervous system dysfunction, corresponding to the 'dilute' phenotype in the mouse, and GS2 as comprising hypomelanosis and lymphohistiocytotic hemophagocytosis, corresponding to the 'ashen' phenotype in mouse.Anikster et al. (2002), Menasche et al. (2002), Huizing et al. (2002), and Bahadoran et al. (2003, 2003) suggested that Elejalde syndrome (256710) in some patients and GS1 represent the same entity."

Partial agenesis of the corpus callosum and a selective immunoglobulin IgG2 subclass deficiency have also been reported in some patients."
"Summary of Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency: Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is an inherited disease that affects the brain and muscles. People with this disease may begin showing symptoms from early infancy to age three. Signs and symptoms can vary but may include mild to severe intellectual disability, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), problems with speech, and involuntary movements. People with this disease may also have behavioral problems, including hyperactivity, autistic behaviors, and self-mutilation. GAMT deficiency is caused by changes in the GAMT gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis of the disease may be based on finding increased levels of guanidinoacetate in the urine, and the diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Osteopetrosis, autosomal recessive 1: Osteopetrosis refers to a group of rare, inherited skeletal disorders characterized by increased bone density and abnormal bone growth. Symptoms and severity can vary greatly, ranging from neonatal onset with serious complications (such as bone marrow failure) to the incidental finding of osteopetrosis on X-ray. Depending on severity and age of onset, features may include fractures, short stature, compressive neuropathies (pressure on the nerves), hypocalcemia with attendant tetanic seizures, and pancytopenia. In rare cases, there may be neurological impairment or involvement of other body systems. Osteopetrosis may be caused by genetic changes in at least 10 genes. Inheritance can be autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive with the most severe forms being autosomal recessive."
"Summary of X-linked corneal dermoid: An exceedingly rare, benign, congenital, corneal tumor characterized by bilateral opacification of the cornea with superficial grayish layers and irregular raised whitish plaques, as well as fine blood vessels covering the central cornea, and intact peripheral corneal borders.

"Summary of Trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome: Trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome (TPS) is a disorder of muscle development and function. It is characterized by short muscles and tendons resulting in limited range of motion of the hands, legs, and mouth. The most serious complications of the condition occur as a result of the limited mobility of the mouth (trismus). TPS is typically reported to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is caused by genetic changes in the MYH8 gene."
"Summary of FATCO syndrome: A rare, genetic, congenital limb malformation syndrome characterized by unilateral or bilateral fibular aplasia/hypoplasia, tibial campomelia, and lower limb oligosyndactyly involving the lateral rays. Upper limb oligosyndactyly and cleft lip/palate may also be associated."
"Summary of Hemangiopericytoma, malignant: Hemangiopericytoma is a term used to described a group of tumors that are derived from pericytes, the cells normally arranged along specific types of blood vessels called capillaries and venules. These types of tumors are typically slow-growing, may be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous), and may occur anywhere in the body."
"Summary of Isolated hemihyperplasia: Isolated hemihyperplasia is a rare overgrowth syndrome characterized by an asymmetric regional body overgrowth, involving at least one limb, and associated with an increased risk of developing embryonal tumors, principally nephroblastoma (see this term) and hepoblastoma."
"Summary of Bencze syndrome: Bencze syndrome or hemifacial hyperplasia with strabismus is a malformation syndrome involving the abnormal growth of the facial skeleton as well as its soft tissue structure and organs, and is characterized by mild facial asymmetry with unaffected neurocranium and eyeballs, as well as by esotropia, amblyopia and/or convergent strabismus, and occasionally submucous cleft palate. Transmission is autosomal dominant. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1979."
"Summary of Hemimegalencephaly: Hemimegalencephaly is a rare malformation involving one side of the brain. It may occur alone or in association with other syndromes such as Proteus syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, linear sebaceous nevus syndrome, neurofibromatosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, or Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Children with this disorder may have a large, asymmetrical head accompanied by seizures, partial paralysis, and impaired cognitive development. The cause of Hemimegalencephaly is not fully understood, but involves a disturbance of cells early in development and likely involves genes involved in patterning and symmetry."
"Summary of Hemoglobin C disease: Hemoglobin C disease is a condition affecting a protein in the blood (hemoglobin) which transports oxygen throughout the body. Symptoms of this condition can include fatigue, weakness, and anemia. The spleen can also become enlarged as a result of this disease. For many people with this condition, symptoms are relatively mild and the lifespan is normal. Some people with this condition do not exhibit any symptoms at all. Hemoglobin C disease is caused by a genetic change in the gene that provides instructions to the body to make hemoglobin. This genetic change causes a change in the shape of the red blood cells so that oxygen isn't carried as well throughout the body."
"Summary of Hemoglobin E disease: Hemoglobin E (HbE) disease is a mild, inherited blood disorder characterized by an abnormal form of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin E. People with this condition may have very mild anemia, but the condition typically does not cause any symptoms. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a genetic change in the HBB gene. The genetic change that causes Hemoglobin E disease primarily occurs in Southeast Asian populations, and rarely in Chinese populations."
"Summary of Lethal hemolytic anemia-genital anomalies syndrome: Lethal hemolytic anemia-genital anomalies syndrome is a rare genetic disease that causes severe anemia (a condition where the body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen) and differences with the external genitalia. This can include a small penis (micropenia) and an abnormal location of the urethra (hypospadias). People with this syndrome may also have unusual facial features, such as a flat back of the head, small indentations in the earlobes, deep creases on the soles of the feet, and extra space between the big toe and the second toe."

Systemic manifestations can include musculoskeletal problems (joint stiffness, contractures, scoliosis, and hip dysplasia), hearing loss, respiratory tract and sinopulmonary infections, and cardiac disease (valvular thickening, defects in the cardiac conduction system). Neurologic decline is seen in all affected individuals; however, clinical severity varies within and among the four MPS III subtypes (defined by the enzyme involved) and even among members of the same family. Death usually occurs in the second or third decade of life secondary to neurologic regression or respiratory tract infections."
Summary of Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse reaction to the drug heparin resulting in an abnormally low amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia). HIT is usually an immune response which typically occurs 4-10 days after exposure to heparin. It can lead to serious complications. This condition occurs in up to 5% of those who are exposed to heparin. Characteristic signs of HIT are a drop in platelet count of greater than 50% and/or the formation of new blood clots during heparin therapy.
"Summary of Hepatic cystic hamartoma: Hepatic cystic hamartoma, also named Mesenchyma hamartoma of liver, is a rare benign liver tumor of childhood, usually before the age of 2, of mesenchymal origin and variable clinical presentation (abdominal dissension, abdominal mass, pain, vomiting and signs of inferior vena cava compression)."
"Summary of Hepatoblastoma: Hepatoblastoma is a rare malignant (cancerous) tumor of the live, usually affecting young children. In early stages of the condition, there may be no concerning signs or symptoms. As the tumor gets larger, affected children may experience a painful, abdominal lump; swelling of the abdomen; unexplained weight loss; loss of appetite; and/or nausea and vomiting. The exact underlying cause of Hepatoblastoma is poorly understood. Risk factors for the tumor include prematurity with a very low birth weight, early exposure to hepatitis B infection, biliary atresia, and several different genetic conditions (i.e. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Aicardi syndrome, Glycogen storage disease, and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome)."
"Summary of Tyrosinemia type 1: Tyrosinemia type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated blood levels of the amino acid tyrosine, a building block of most proteins. This enzyme shortage is caused by genetic changes in the FAH gene. Symptoms usually appear in the first few months of life and include failure to thrive, diarrhea, vomiting, jaundice, cabbage-like odor, and increased tendency to bleed (particularly nosebleeds). Tyrosinemia type I can lead to liver and kidney failure, softening and weakening of the bones, problems affecting the nervous system, and an increased risk of liver cancer. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

"Summary of Herpes virus antenatal infection: A group of anomalies that may result from maternal infection and subsequent fetal infection with the Herpes virus. The virus causes recurrent cutaneous infections in adults, often involving the lips or the genitalia. Herpes infections in other organs, such as the liver or central nervous system, are less frequent. Pregnancy complications including preterm delivery, intrauterine growth retardation, and neonatal infection have been attributed to the Herpes virus. Exposure of the fetus to Herpes virus at the time of delivery carries a serious risk of infection for the newborn."

"Summary of Congenital high-molecular-weight kininogen deficiency: A rare genetic hematologic disease characterized by abnormal surface-mediated activation of fibrinolysis due to the deficiency of high-molecular-weight kininogen in plasma. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may be prolonged. Clinically, patients are typically asymptomatic and do not show increased bleeding or thrombotic tendency."
"Summary of Hip dysplasia, Beukes type: Beukes hip dysplasia (BHD) is a rare inherited skeletal dysplasia affecting the hip joint. In general, skeletal dysplasias are a group of disorders which affect the bone and cartilage. Skeletal dysplasias are more commonly known as types of dwarfism, but not all skeletal dysplasias cause a person to be short in height. In fact, BHD only affects the hip joint. A person with BHD is similar in height to other family members. There are no other health problems associated with BHD. Beukes hip dysplasia (BHD) causes severe progressive degenerative osteoarthritis of the hip joint in early adulthood. Symptoms of hip joint pain and discomfort usually begin in infancy or later childhood, but may also begin as late as the mid-30s. Severity of the condition varies even among family members. In fact some people who inherit the change in the gene which causes BHD never develop any problems with their hip joint. After symptoms begin, the characteristic signs of secondary osteoarthritis (including bone sclerosis, cyst formation and narrowing of the joint space) develop and the joint deteriorates rapidly. As of 2015, BHD has only been found in relatives of a single family in South Africa who were of European descent. BHD has affected many generations and members of this family. Family members with BHD now live in other parts of the world as well."

"Summary of Homocystinuria due to defect in methylation cbl e: Disorders of intracellular cobalamin metabolism have a variable phenotype and age of onset that are influenced by the severity and location within the pathway of the defect. The prototype and best understood phenotype is cblC; it is also the most common of these disorders. The age of initial presentation of cblC spans a wide range: In utero with fetal presentation of nonimmune hydrops, cardiomyopathy, and intrauterine growth restriction. Newborns, who can have microcephaly, poor feeding, and encephalopathy. Infants, who can have poor feeding and slow growth, neurologic abnormality, and, rarely, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Toddlers, who can have poor growth, progressive microcephaly, cytopenias (including megaloblastic anemia), global developmental delay, encephalopathy, and neurologic signs such as hypotonia and seizures. Adolescents and adults, who can have neuropsychiatric symptoms, progressive cognitive decline, thromboembolic compications, and/or subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord."
Summary of Homocystinuria due to defect in methylation cbl g: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Homocystinuria due to methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency: Homocystinuria due to methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency (MTHFR deficiency) is a genetic condition that results from poor metabolism of folate (also called vitamin B9), due to a lack of working enzyme called MTHFR. The gene that tells our body how to make the enzyme is also called MTHFR. At least 40 rare MTHFR gene variants have been found in people with decreased or no working enzyme. Very common gene variants (C677T and A1298C) can cause some decrease in enzyme function. People with Homocystinuria due to MTHFR deficiency tend to have two rare variants or sometimes a rare variant and a common variant. Very rarely people inherit a combination of three or four common variants from their parents (for example two C677T variants and two A1298C variants) and may also develop very high levels of homocystine in their body. Homocystinuria usually does not show symptoms in a newborn baby. Symptoms may include abnormal clotting, developmental delay, seizures, intellectual disability, and microcephaly. Severe homocystinuria can also be caused by gene variants in other genes besides MTHFR."

Bowing of radius may be additionally present."
"Summary of Humero-radio-ulnar synostosis: Humero-radio-ulnar synostosis is an extremely rare, genetic, congenital joint formation defect disorder characterized by uni- or bilateral fusion of the humerus, radius and ulnar bones, leading to loss of elbow motion and, in most, functional arm incapacity. It may appear as distal humeral bifurcation with absent elbow joint and shortened arm length on imaging. Hand abnormalities, namely oligoectrosyndactyly, may be associated."
"Summary of Humerus trochlea aplasia: An extremely rare familial bone deformity described only in Japanese patients to date. The deformity is bilateral in nearly half of patients (with bilateral involvement, the condition is symmetrical) and sometimes causes ulnar nerve palsy or cubitus varus."
"Summary of Hunter-McAlpine syndrome: Hunter-McAlpine syndrome is a very rare condition characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and small head size (microcephaly). Sometimes the microcephaly results from early closure of the bones in the skull, which is called craniosynostosis. This can cause a misshapen skull and is common in individuals with Hunter-McAlpine syndrome; in fact another name for the condition is Hunter-McAlpine craniosynostosis syndrome. Hunter-McAlpine syndrome is a genetic condition, meaning that it is caused by changes in the genes."
Summary of Hunter Mcdonald syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cystic echinococcosis: Cystic echinococcosis, or hydatidosis, is a cosmopolitan larval cestodosis caused principally by the Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm, the adult form of which parasitises the intestine of dogs. Cystic echinococcosis generally affects large domestic herbivores; humans are dead-end hosts, infected through contact with herding dogs or through ingestion of food contaminated with canine excrement."

"Summary of Hydrops fetalis: Hydrops fetalis is a serious condition in which abnormal amounts of fluid build up in two or more body areas of a fetus or newborn. There are two types of Hydrops fetalis: immune and nonimmune. Immune Hydrops fetalis is a complication of a severe form of Rh incompatibility. Rh compatibility causes massive red blood cell destruction, which leads to several problems, including total body swelling. Severe swelling can interfere with how the body organs work. Nonimmune Hydrops fetalis occurs when a disease or medical condition disrupts the body's ability to manage fluid. There are three main causes for this type: heart or lung problems, severe anemia (thalassemia), and genetic defects, including Turner syndrome. The exact cause depends on which form a baby has."
Summary of Hygroma cervical: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Hymenolepiasis: Hymenolepiasis is a cosmopolitan parasitosis caused by a hymenolepidid tapeworm infection, most commonly Hymenolepis nana, that is reported worldwide but particularly in tropical and subtropical countries and which is usually asymptomatic but in severe cases can also manifest with nausea, abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea and overall weakness."
"Summary of Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever: Hyper IgD syndrome is the less severe form of a metabolic disorder known as mevalonate kinase deficiency. It is considered an auto-inflammatory disease, with recurrent episodic or chronic unexplained inflammation, characterized by periodic episodes of fever, and other symptoms such as joint pain, swollen lymph nodes, skin rash, headaches, and abdominal pain. Most episodes last several days and occur periodically throughout life. The frequency of episodes and their severity vary greatly from person to person. These attacks can occur spontaneously or be triggered by vaccinations, infections, and/or emotional or physical stress. Growth and development is usually not affected. Hyper IgD syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the MVK gene which provides instructions for making the mevalonate kinase enzyme. The genetic changes result in the partial deficiency of the enzyme. A more severe form of maevalonate kinase deficiency is known as mevalonic aciduria. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Familial hyperaldosteronism type II: A heritable form of primary aldosteronism (PA) characterized by hypertension of varying severity, non-glucocorticoid remediable hyperaldosteronism, variable hypokalemia, low plasma renin activity (PRA) and increased aldosterone-to-renin ratio."
"Summary of Familial hyperaldosteronism type I: Familial hyperaldosteronism type I is one of three types of familial hyperaldosteronism. Aldosterone is a hormone manufactured by the adrenal glands which helps the body retain water and sodium and excrete potassium. It is caused by a fusion of the CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. These individuals are also at an increased risk for a certain type of stroke known as a hemorrhagic stroke. First-line therapy consists of a steroid such as prednisone, dexamethasone, or hydrocortisone. This will often correct the overproduction of aldosterone, lower the blood pressure, and correct the potassium levels."
"Summary of Transient familial neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: Transient familial neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is a rare genetic liver disease that can happen to newborn babies. It causes high levels of bilirubin in the blood, which can make the baby's skin and eyes look yellow (jaundice) during the first few days of life. Usually, the condition goes away on its own, but in some cases, it can lead to a more serious condition called kernicterus (brain damage resulting from high levels of bilirubin). This can cause symptoms like being very tired, crying in a high-pitched way, having weak muscles, missing reflexes, throwing up, or having seizures. Kernicterus can cause long-term problems or even death."
"Summary of Dubin-Johnson syndrome: Dubin-Johnson syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, an increase in the urinary excretion of coproporphyrin isomer I, deposition of melanin-like pigment in hepatocytes, and prolonged retention of sulfobromophthalein, but otherwise normal liver function (summary by Wada et al., 1998)."

"Summary of Hypereosinophilic syndrome: Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) refers to a rare group of conditions that are associated with persistent eosinophilia with evidence of organ involvement. Signs and symptoms vary significantly based on which parts of the body are affected. Although any organ system can be involved in HES, the heart, central nervous system, skin, and respiratory tract are the most commonly affected. The condition was originally thought to be ""idiopathic"" or of unknown cause. However, recent advances in diagnostic testing have allowed a cause to be identified in approximately a quarter of cases."
"Summary of Hereditary hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome: Hereditary hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome is a rare genetic disease characterized by the association of early onset cataract with consistently high ferritin levels in the blood even when there is no excess iron in the body. The severity of the condition can vary significantly from person to person, even among members of the same family. Hereditary hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome is caused by changes in the FTL gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Isolated glycerol kinase deficiency: Isolated glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is a very rare X-linked disorder of glycerol metabolism characterized biochemically by elevated plasma and urine glycerol levels, and clinically by variable neurometabolic manifestations, depending on the age of onset, and varying from a life-threatening childhood metabolic crisis to an asymptomatic adult form (infantile GKD, juvenile GKD, and adult GKD (see these terms))."
"Summary of Hypergonadotropic ovarian failure, familial or sporadic: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Combined immunodeficiency due to DOCK8 deficiency: Combined immunodeficiency due to DOCK8 deficiency (also known as autosomal recessive hyper IgE syndrome or AR-HIES) is a very rare primary immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by highly elevated blood levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), recurrent staphylococcal skin abscesses, and recurrent pneumonia. The same features are also seen in the more frequent autosomal dominant HIES syndrome. AR-HIES accounts for only a small minority of HIES cases, with about 130 affected families reported so far. In contrast to AD-HIES, the AR variant is further characterized by extreme hypereosinophilia (increase in the eosinophil count in the bloodstream); susceptibility to viral infections such as Herpes simplex and Molluscum contagiosum; involvement of the central nervous system; T-cell defects; and a high death rate. The dental, skeletal, connective tissue, and facial features present in AD-HIES are absent in AR-HIES. AR-HIES is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is caused by genetic changes in the DOCK8 gene."
"Summary of Hyperinsulinism due to glucokinase deficiency: Hyperinsulism due to glucokinase deficiency (HIGCK) is a form of diazoxide-sensitive diffuse hyperinsulinism (see this term), caused by a lowered threshold for insulin release, characterized by an excessive/ uncontrolled insulin secretion (inappropriate for the level of glycemia) and recurrent episodes of profound hypoglycemia induced by fasting and protein rich meals, requiring rapid and intensive treatment to prevent neurological sequelae."

"Summary of Epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma: A rare, non-syndromic, hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma characterized by diffuse, yellowish, thick hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles with a sharp demarcation at the volar border and an erythematous margin, and the epidermolytic pattern of changes on the skin biopsy, including perinuclear vacuolization, granular degeneration of keratinocytes in the spinous and granular layer, and tonofilament aggregates. Painful fissures and hyperhidrosis are frequently associated."
"Summary of Hyperlysinemia: Hyperlysinemia is an inherited condition characterized by elevated blood levels of the amino acid lysine. Hyperlysinemia typically causes no health problems, and most people with elevated lysine levels are unaware that they have this condition. Rarely, people with Hyperlysinemia have intellectual disability or behavioral problems. Hyperlysinemia is caused by genetic changes in the AASS gene. It has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome: A rare, genetic disorder of urea cycle metabolism characterized by either a neonatal-onset with manifestations of lethargy, poor feeding, vomiting and tachypnea or, more commonly, presentations in infancy, childhood or adulthood with chronic neurocognitive deficits, acute encephalopathy and/or coagulation defects or other chronic liver dysfunction."
"Summary of Juvenile Paget disease: Juvenile Paget disease is a very rare condition that affects bone growth. This condition causes bones to be abnormally large, misshapen, and easily broken (fractured). Signs and symptoms usually appear in infancy or early childhood. As bones grow, they become weaker and more deformed. This condition affects the entire skeleton, resulting in widespread bone and joint pain. The bones of the skull tend to grow unusually large and thick, which can lead to hearing loss. The condition also affects bones of the spine (vertebrae), leading to abnormal curvature of the spine. Additionally, weight-bearing long bones in the legs tend to bow and fracture easily, which can interfere with standing and walking. Juvenile Paget disease is caused by genetic changes in the TNFRSF11B gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Hyperostosis corticalis generalisata: Hyperostosis corticalis generalisata, also known as van Buchem disease, is a rare craniotubular hyperostosis characterized by hyperostosis of the skull, mandible, clavicles, ribs and diaphyses of the long bones, as well as the tubular bones of the hands and feet. Clinical manifestations include increased skull thickness with cranial nerve entrapment causing inconsistent cranial nerve palsies."
"Summary of Primary hyperoxaluria type 1: Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare disorder that mainly affects the kidneys. It results from buildup of a substance called oxalate, which normally is filtered through the kidneys and excreted in the urine. In people with PH1, the accumulated oxalate is deposited in the kidneys and urinary tract. It combines with calcium, forming the main component of kidney and bladder stones (calcium oxalate). Signs and symptoms of PH1 vary in severity and may begin any time from infancy to early adulthood. Symptoms may include recurrent kidney stones; blood in the urine; and urinary tract infections. PH1 is due to genetic changes in a gene called AGXT. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Primary hyperoxaluria type 2: Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is a rare condition characterized by the overproduction of a substance called oxalate (also called oxalic acid). In the kidneys, the excess oxalate combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney stones. Deposits of calcium oxalate can lead to kidney damage, kidney failure, and injury to other organs. Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is caused by the shortage (deficiency) of an enzyme called glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) that normally prevents the buildup of oxalate. This enzyme shortage is caused by genetic changes in the GRHPR gene. Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
Summary of Neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism: Neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) is characterized by severe hypercalcemia (> 3.5 mM) from birth and associated with major hyperparathyroidism.
"Summary of Pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase deficiency: Dehydratase deficiency or pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) is considered a transient and benign form of hyperphenylalaninemia due to tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (see this term), characterized by muscular hypotonia, irritability (detected by EEG), slow acquisition of psychomotor skills, age-dependent movement disorders, including dystonia and an accompanying excretion of 7-substituted pterins. Neurological developement is normal with dietary control of blood phenyalanine. PCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency: GTP-cyclohydrolase I deficiency, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, is one of the causes of malignant hyperphenylalaninemia due to tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. Not only does tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency cause hyperphenylalaninemia, it is also responsible for defective neurotransmission of monoamines because of malfunctioning tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, both tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent hydroxylases."
"Summary of Hyperprolinemia type 1: Hyperprolinemia is when there is an excess of a particular protein building block (amino acid), called proline, in the blood. This condition generally occurs when proline is not broken down properly by the body. There are two inherited forms: Hyperprolinemia type 1 and Hyperprolinemia type 2. People with Hyperprolinemia type I often do not show any symptoms, although they have proline levels in their blood between 3 and 10 times the normal level. Less commonly, affected individuals can experience seizures, intellectual disability, or other neurological or psychiatric problems. Hyperprolinemia is caused by genetic changes in the PRODH gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."

"Summary of Maternal hyperthermia-induced birth defects: Maternal hyperthermia induced birth defects is a rare maternal disease-related embryofetopathy characterized by variable developmental anomalies of the fetus due to teratogenic effect of elevated maternal body temperature (resulting from febrile illness or hot environment exposure). Reported developmental anomalies include neural tube defects (spina bifida, ecephalocele, anencephaly), cardiac defects (transposition of great vessels), urogenital defects (hypospadias), abdominal wall defects, cleft lip/palate, eye defects (cataract, coloboma) or various minor anomalies (e.g., bifid uvula, preauricular pit or tag). Consensus regarding cause-effect relationship has not been reached."
"Summary of Familial hyperthyroidism due to mutations in TSH receptor: A rare hyperthyroidism characterized by mild to severe hyperthyroidism, presence of goiter, absence of features of autoimmunity, frequent relapses while on treatment and a positive family history."
"Summary of X-linked congenital generalized hypertrichosis: X-linked congenital generalized hypertrichosis is a rare congenital (present at birth) skin disease. It is characterized by hair overgrowth on the entire body in males, and mild and asymmetric hair overgrowth in females. It is associated with mild facial abnormalities (including nasal openings that are tipped upwards and moderate protrusion of the jaw) and occasional teeth anomalies and deafness. It is caused by a specific abnormality of the X chromosome. Inheritance is X-linked. It is important to know if the disease occurs alone (is an isolated form), or if it is part of a genetic syndrome."
"Summary of Acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa: A rare cutaneous paraneoplastic disease characterized by the presence of excessive lanugo-type hair on the glabrous skin of face, neck, trunk and limbs that can be associated with additional clinical features such as burning glossitis, papillary hypertrophy of the tongue, diarrhea, dysgeusia, and/or weight loss. It is associated with lymphoma or cancer of the gastrointestinal system, urinary tract, lung, breast, uterus or ovary."
"Summary of Hypertrichosis lanuginosa congenita: Hypertrichosis lanuginosa congenita is a congenital (present from birth) skin disease characterized by excessive lanugo (very fine, soft, unpigmented) hair covering the entire body, with the exception of the palms, soles, and mucous membranes. The hair can grow to be 3 to 5 cm in length. This condition appears to follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Hypertryptophanemia: Hypertryptophanemia is a rare condition that likely occurs due to abnormalities in the body's ability to process the amino acid (a building block of proteins), tryptophan. People affected by this condition may experience intellectual disability and behavioral problems (i.e. periodic mood swings, exaggerated emotional responses and abnormal sexual behavior). The underlying genetic cause of Hypertryptophanemia is currently unknown; however, it appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Apolipoprotein A-I deficiency: Apolipoprotein A-I deficiency (also known as Familial HDL deficiency) is a rare genetic condition that causes low levels of ""good"" cholesterol (HDL) in the blood. HDL helps remove excess cholesterol and fats from your blood. This condition is caused by changes in the ABCA1 or the APOA1 genes. The deficiency is passed through families in an autosomal dominant pattern. More severely reduced levels of HDL in the blood is a characteristic feature of a related disorder called Tangier disease."
"Summary of Hypoaldosteronism: Hypoaldosteronism is a condition characterized by the shortage (deficiency) or impaired function of a hormone called aldosterone. The symptoms of this condition include low sodium (hyponatremia), too much potassium (hyperkalemia), and a condition where the body produces too much acid (metabolic acidosis). These symptoms may cause muscle weakness, nausea, heart palpitations, irregular heartbeat, and abnormal blood pressure. Hypoaldosteronism may be described as hyporeninemic (low renin level) or hyperreninemic (high renin level) based on the amount of another chemical produced in the kidneys called renin. Hypoaldosteronism can be caused by other health conditions or medications. Individuals with diabetes, kidney disease, primary adrenal insufficiency, lead poisoning, or severe illness can develop Hypoaldosteronism. Certain medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, heparin or medications used to treat heart failure can cause Hypoaldosteronism. There are rare forms of congenital Hypoaldosteronism that can be inherited in families. This condition is diagnosed based on the symptoms and confirmed by various blood tests (plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone, and serum cortisol) The exact incidence of Hypoaldosteronism is unknown."
"Summary of Hypobetalipoproteinemia, familial, 1: Hypobetalipoproteinemia, familial, 1 is a disorder that impairs the body's ability to absorb and transport fats, causing low levels of cholesterol in the blood. The severity of the condition varies widely. Mildly affected people may have no signs or symptoms. Many affected people develop an abnormal buildup of fats in the liver (called hepatic steatosis, or fatty liver). In severe cases, this may progress to cirrhosis. Some people also have digestive problems in childhood, resulting in failure to thrive. Hypobetalipoproteinemia, familial, 1 is usually caused by genetic changes in the APOB gene. In a few cases, it may be caused by genetic changes in other genes, or the cause may be unknown. It is inherited in an autosomal codominant manner; a genetic change in one copy of the APOB gene can cause the condition, but changes in both copies of the gene cause more severe symptoms."
Summary of Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia: A rare disorder of calcium homeostasis characterized by variable degrees of hypocalcemia with abnormally low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and persistant normal or elevated calciuria.
"Summary of Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) type 3 is one of three recognized types of FHH, an inherited condition that causes abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). FHH also causes high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and low levels of calcium in the urine (hypocalciuria). In most cases, FHH does not cause signs or symptoms. However, some people with FHH do report symptoms. Signs and symptoms that may occur in some people with FHH type 3 include high magnesium in addition to calcium, general symptoms of hypercalcemia (such as weakness, fatigue, muscle pain, constipation, depression, confusion, and excessive thirst), lower bone mineral density, behavioral disorders, and learning disabilities. FHH type 3 is caused by a genetic change in the AP2S1 gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Achondrogenesis: Achondrogenesis is a group of severe disorders that are present from birth and affect the development of cartilage and bone. Infants with Achondrogenesis usually have a small body, extremely short arms and legs, other skeletal abnormalities, and underdeveloped lungs. There are at least three forms of Achondrogenesis, type 1A, type 1B and type 2. Achondrogenesis is usually diagnosed during pregnancy by ultrasound and genetic testing is used to distinguish between the three types. Type 1A and 1B Achondrogenesis are both inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Type 1A is caused by genetic changes in the TRIP11 gene. Type 1B is caused by genetic changes in the SLC26A2 gene. Type 2 Achondrogenesis is caused by new (de novo) genetic changes in the COL2A1 gene. Because of the severity of this condition, most infants with Achondrogenesis die before or shortly after birth."

"Summary of Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 7 with or without anosmia: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 7 with or without anosmia is a condition where a person's sexual development remains incomplete or absent by the age of 18. This happens because the body doesn't produce enough hormones that are needed for sexual development. This disease is caused by gene variants in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR). It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Some people with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 7 may also have other problems like difficulty smelling, a cleft palate, or hearing loss. When a person has difficulty smelling, the condition is called Kallmann syndrome (KS). When a person has a normal sense of smell, it is called normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH)."

The limb anomalies varied from postaxial polydactyly to severe upper limb hypoplasia with split hand. The mode of transmission is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Familial isolated hypoparathyroidism: Familial isolated hypoparathyroidism (FIH) is a rare heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders characterized by abnormal calcium metabolism due to deficient secretion of parathormone (PTH), without other endocrine disorders or developmental defects."
"Summary of Hypoparathyroidism-sensorineural deafness-renal disease syndrome: Hypoparathyroidism-sensorineural deafness-renal disease syndrome (HDR syndrome), also known as Barakat syndrome, is a rare, genetic syndrome characterized by hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal (kidney) disease. However, specific symptoms and severity can vary. About 65% of people with Barakat syndrome have all three of these features, while the others have various combinations of these features. Some people with Barakat syndrome have one or more of these as well as additional features. Hypoparathyroidism leads to low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia), which can cause symptoms such as muscle pain, muscle spasms, seizures, and rarely, cardiomyopathy. Hearing loss is the most consistent feature of Barakat syndrome. It is usually bilateral and can range from moderate to profound. The type of kidney disease present can vary from person to person. For example, some people with Barakat syndrome are born with structural kidney or urinary tract abnormalities (underdeveloped or abnormally-formed), while others may have functional abnormalities (such as nephrotic syndrome, hematuria, renal tubular acidosis, or chronic kidney disease). Various additional features have been reported in some people with Barakat syndrome such as polycystic ovaries, distinctive facial features, ischemic stroke, retinitis pigmentosa, intellectual disability, growth failure, congenital heart disease, and other birth defects. Most cases of Barakat syndrome are caused by genetic changes in the GATA3 gene, or by a missing piece (deletion) of genetic material on chromosome 10 that includes the GATA3 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. In some cases, the genetic cause is unknown. Barakat syndrome can be clinically diagnosed (without genetic testing) in a person with the complete triad of hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal disease; or, in a person with two of these features who also has a positive family history. For those who have only deafness or renal disease, and for others who do not fit this criteria, genetic testing that identifies a GATA3 genetic change is needed to confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Hypoparathyroidism, x-linked: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Hypopituitarism: Hypopituitarism occurs when the body has low levels of certain hormones made by the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland normally makes several hormones (including growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, vasopressin, and oxytocin). These hormones are important for directing body growth and development, and for regulating blood pressure and metabolism. Symptoms of this condition vary and depend on which hormones are affected."
"Summary of Hypoplastic right heart syndrome: Hypoplastic right heart syndrome is a rare heart defect, present at birth (congenital), that results in low blood oxygen levels. It is caused by underdevelopment of the structures on the right side of the heart (tricuspid valve, right ventricle, pulmonary valve, and pulmonary artery) and commonly associated with atrial septal defect. The underdeveloped right side of the heart is unable to provide enough blood flow to the body, leading to low blood oxygen and cyanosis. It differs from hypoplastic left heart syndrome which involves the underdevelopment of the structures on the left side of the heart."
"Summary of Congenital factor II deficiency: Congenital factor II deficiency is a blood disorder that affects the ability of the blood to clot properly. Symptoms of the deficiency include prolonged bleeding, especially after an injury or after surgery. Women with Congenital factor II deficiency may have heavy menstrual bleeding. The severity of the disease can vary, with some people experiencing severe bleeding without any known cause, and others only experiencing increased bleeding after a surgery or serious injury. Congenital factor II deficiency is caused by changes in the F2 gene. There are two types of inherited Congenital factor II deficiency. Type I or hypoprothrombinemia and type II or dysprothrombinemia. Inheritance of both types is autosomal recessive. Diagnosis is based on laboratory test results that are consistent with the deficiency. A form of the disease that is not inherited (acquired) can be caused by vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, or an autoimmune response."

"Summary of Hypothalamic hamartomas: Hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are rare, tumor-like malformations that occur during fetal development and are present at birth. The lesions usually do not change in size or spread to other locations. Both the type and severity of symptoms vary greatly among patients with Hypothalamic hamartomas. Common symptoms include frequent gelastic seizures (spontaneous laughing, giggling and/or smirking) or dacrystic seizures (crying or grunting); developmental delays; and/or precocious puberty. Additional symptoms may include cognitive impairment; emotional and behavioral difficulties; and endocrine disturbances. These symptoms often start early in life but are frequently misdiagnosed. For some patients, endocrine (hormonal) disturbances such as central precocious puberty may be the only symptom. Though Hypothalamic hamartomas can occur in patients with certain genetic disorders (such as Pallister-Hall syndrome), the majority of cases are sporadic."

Binocular vision and color vision are normal and visual acuity is typically better than 6/12. An abnormal head posture is seen in approximately 15% of affected individuals. The eyes are structurally normal and electrophysiologic studies (e.g., visual evoked potential, electroretinogram) are normal. Affected females report slightly better visual acuity than affected males; however, no differences between males and females in the amplitude, frequency, and waveform of nystagmus are observed."
"Summary of Anterior segment dysgenesis 3: Anterior segment dysgenesis 3 is a rare condition that affects the eyes. People with this condition are born with malformations of the iris (the colored part of the eye) and cornea, which eventually lead to early-onset glaucoma. The irides of affected people are unusually dark. For example, studies of the condition often describe 'brown' irides as a dark, chocolate color and 'blue' irides as a very dark, slate gray. The iris also lacks the usual pattern and has a smooth appearance. Anterior segment dysgenesis 3 is caused by changes in the FOXC1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."

"Summary of Immune deficiency, familial variable: Familial variable immune deficiency is a condition where the body's immune system doesn't work properly. This can cause people to get sick more often. Symptoms can include high levels of a protein called IgM, and low levels of other proteins called IgG and IgA. Some people only have high levels of IgM. The condition runs in families and appears to follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Short-limb skeletal dysplasia with severe combined immunodeficiency: Achondroplasia with severe combined immunodeficiency is an extremely rare type of SCID. The condition is characterized by the classic signs of SCID, including severe and recurrent infections, diarrhea, failure to thrive, and absence of T and B lymphocytes along with skeletal anomalies like short stature, bowing of the long bones and other abnormalities affecting the ends of the long bones (metaphyseal abnormalities). Achondroplasia with severe combined immunodeficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Imperforate oropharynx-costovertebral anomalies syndrome: Imperforate oropharynx-costovertebral anomalies syndrome is a dysostosis with predominant vertebral and costal involvement characterized by oropharyngeal atresia, mild mandibulofacial dysostosis, auricular malformations, and costovertebral anomalies (hemivertebrae, block vertebra, partial fusion of the ribs, absent ribs).

Summary of Infundibulopelvic dysgenesis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 4: Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 4, also known as congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), is an inherited disease where there is an inability to feel pain and temperature, and decreased or absent sweating (anhidrosis). The signs and symptoms of CIPA usually appear at birth or during infancy. The inability to feel pain and temperature often leads to repeated, severe injuries and unintentional self-injury is common. People with CIPA may also heal slowly from skin and bone injuries, which can lead to chronic bone infections (osteomyelitis) or a condition called Charcot joints. Absent sweating can cause recurrent, high fevers (hyperpyrexia) and seizures brought on by high temperature (febrile seizures). Other features may include dental caries, difficulty controlling urine and defecating (urine and fecal incontinence), behavioral or emotional problems and intellectual disability. CIPA is caused by changes in the NTRK1 gene. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome: Mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome is a very rare condition characterized by problems with cell division (specifically during mitosis) that results in a high number of cells with missing (monosomy) or extra (trisomy) genetic material in multiple chromosomes and tissues (mosaic aneuploidies). Only about 50 cases have been described in the medical literature. Features include severe microcephaly, growth deficiency and short stature, mild physical abnormalities, eye abnormalities, problems with the brain and central nervous system, seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. The risk for cancer is increased, with rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilm's tumor, and leukemia reported in several cases. MVA syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition. It can be caused by changes in the BUB1B gene or the CEP57 gene. The BUB1B gene encodes BubR1, a key protein in mitotic spindle checkpoint function. The CEP57 gene is involved in microtubule stabilization. Both play a role in the process of cell division."
"Summary of Insulin-resistance syndrome type A: Type A insulin-resistance syndrome belongs to the group of extreme insulin-resistance syndromes (which includes leprechaunism, the lipodystrophies, Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome and type B insulin resistance syndrome; see these terms) and is characterized by the triad of hyperinsulinemia, acanthosis nigricans (skin lesions associated with insulin resistance), and signs of hyperandrogenism in females without lipodystrophy and who are not overweight."
Summary of Insulin-resistance syndrome type B: A rare genetic disease that belongs to the group of extreme insulin-resistance syndromes and is due to autoantibodies directed against insulin receptor.
"Summary of Insulinoma: Insulinoma is a type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pancreatic NET), which refers to a group of rare tumors that form in the hormone-making cells of the pancreas. Insulinomas, specifically, produce too much insulin, a hormone that reduces the level of sugar in the blood by helping it move into cells. As a result, people with Insulinomas generally have very low blood sugar levels which can be associated with anxiety, confusion, hunger, a fast heart rate, and sweating. In severe cases, it can lead to seizures, coma or even death. Ninty percent of Insulinomas are benign (noncancerous). In most cases, the underlying cause of Insulinoma is unknown. However, people with specific genetic syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type I, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis are at risk of Insulinomas and other endocrine tumors."
"Summary of Interferon gamma, receptor 1, deficiency: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Internal carotid absence: Internal carotid absence (also known as internal carotid agenesis) occurs when one or both of the blood vessels that supply blood to the brain (internal carotid arteries) do not develop (agenesis). The missing carotid artery can be on either side of the body. People missing one or both of the internal carotid arteries may not have any symptoms, because the body develops other blood vessel pathways to carry blood to the head. Some people do have symptoms including headaches, blurred vision, paralysis of some of the nerves in the head (palsy), recurrent seizures (epilepsy), or muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis). People who have internal carotid absence have an increased risk for enlargement of the other blood vessels (aneurysm) in the brain. The exact cause of internal carotid absence is not known. Diagnosis of internal carotid absence often occurs accidentally when a person is having a brain MRI or CT scan. The diagnosis can be confirmed with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Due to a higher risk of brain aneurysms seen in people who have internal carotid absence, screening for aneurysms may be recommended."
"Summary of Multiple intestinal atresia: Multiple intestinal atresia is a rare form of intestinal atresia characterized by the presence of numerous atresic segments in the small bowel (duodenum) or large bowel and leading to symptoms of intestinal obstruction: vomiting, abdominal bloating and inability to pass meconium in newborns."
"Summary of Intestinal pseudoobstruction, neuronal, chronic idiopathic, x-linked: Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a condition characterized by impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract. The condition may arise from abnormalities of the gastrointestinal muscles themselves (myogenic) or from problems with the nerves that control the muscle contractions (neurogenic). When intestinal pseudo-obstruction occurs by itself, it is called primary or idiopathic (unknown cause) intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The disorder can also develop as a complication of another medical condition; in these cases, it is called secondary intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Individuals with this condition have symptoms that resemble those of an intestinal blockage (obstruction) but without any obstruction. It may be acute or chronic and is characterized by the presence of dilation of the bowel on imaging. The causes may be unknown or due to alterations in the FLNA gene, other genes or are secondary to other conditions. It may be inherited in some cases. Intestinal pseudoobstruction neuronal chronic idiopathic X-linked is caused by alterations in the FLNA gene which is located in the X chromosome."
"Summary of Cerebral arteriovenous malformation: Cerebral arteriovenous malformation, also known as intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), are abnormal connections between the arteries and veins in the brain. Most people with brain or spinal AVMs experience few, if any, major symptoms. About 12 percent of people with this condition experience symptoms that vary greatly in severity. Seizures and headaches are the most common symptoms of AVMs but individuals can also experience a wide range of other neurological symptoms. AVMs can cause hemorrhage (bleeding) in the brain, which can be fatal. Symptoms can appear at any age, but are most often noticed when people are in their twenties, thirties, or forties. The cause of AVMs is not yet well understood but it is believed that AVMs result from mistakes that occur during embryonic or fetal development."
"Summary of Congenital intrinsic factor deficiency: Congenital intrinsic factor deficiency is a rare condition that is characterized by pernicious anemia and neurological abnormalities. Symptoms may include failure to thrive and symptoms related to anemia (i.e. fatigue, pale skin, etc.). Nervous system damage may occur which can be associated with confusion; depression; and numbness or tingling in the hands and/or feet. Congenital intrinsic factor deficiency is caused by changes in the GIF gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Iodine antenatal exposure: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Anterior segment dysgenesis 4: Anterior segment dysgenesis 4 is a rare condition that affects the eyes. The irides of affected people are unusually dark. For example, studies of the condition often describe 'brown' irides as a dark, chocolate color and 'blue' irides as a very dark, slate gray. The iris also lacks the usual pattern and has a smooth appearance. Anterior segment dysgenesis 4 is caused by changes in the PITX2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Coxopodopatellar syndrome: Coxopodopatellar syndrome, also known as small patella syndrome (SPS), is a rare syndrome that mainly affects the way certain bones are formed (developed). A person with SPS usually has very small kneecaps (hypoplastic patella) or may have no kneecaps at all (aplastic). The hip (pelvic) bones may be weak, and the bones of the feet may not have formed correctly. Occasionally, bones in the face may also be affected. SPS is caused by a change (pathogenic variant) in the TBX4 gene. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Diagnosis of the syndrome is suspected based on features that can be seen in a physical exam and on imaging tests such as X-rays. Diagnosis of SPS can be confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Isosporiasis: Isosporiasis (also known as cystoisosporiasis) is an exclusively human parasitosis occurring mainly in the tropics and subtropics, due to infection with Isospora belli (through ingestion of contaminated food), that is frequently asymptomatic or that can cause fever and diarrhea, but that is usually a self-limiting condition in the immunocompetent. HIV-positive individuals are particularly at risk of suffering from symptomatic isosporiasis and can manifest with a more severe clinical course of chronic diarrhea and severe weight loss."
Summary of Jaffer Beighton syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of CLN2 disease: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 2 (CLN2) is a type of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a group of severe diseases that affect the nervous system. Children with CLN2 may experience speech delay, seizures that do not respond to medications, loss of muscle coordination (ataxia), muscle twitches (myoclonus), loss of vision, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. CLN2 is caused by changes (pathogenic variations) in the TPP1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. All types of NCL also belong to a larger group of diseases known as lysosomal storage disorders."
"Summary of Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type: Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type is a bone disease characterized by short stature involving the trunk. Spondylorefers to the spine (vertebrae), ""metaphysis"" refers to the wide part of the bone that contains the growth plate (the part of the bone that grows during childhood), and ""dysplasia"" means abnormal growth. It usually starts in early childhood when poor growth with uneven stature and a waddling gait with bow legs (genu varum) is noticed. Early osteoarthritis of the joints is also common. Other signs and symptoms include small hands and fingers, spine deformities, and X-ray showing short vertebra, mild metaphyseal changes, severe delay in ossification, square, short, flared iliac wings (the broadest part of the pelvic bone) and a flat and irregular hipbone. Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type is caused by genetic changes in the TRPV4 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome: Jervell Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is an inherited disorder characterized by deafness present at birth and abnormalities of the electrical system of the heart. It is a form of long QT syndrome. This refers to the QT interval measurement seen on the electrocardiogram. The severity of cardiac symptoms seen in individuals varies from no apparent symptoms to increasing heartbeat (tachycardia), fainting, and cardiac arrest. There are two different types of JLNS type: 1, caused by genetic changes in the KCNQ1 gene, and type 2, caused by genetic changes in the KCNE1 gene. Both types are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Jeune syndrome: Jeune syndrome is a rare condition that primarily affects the bones. Common signs and symptoms include a small chest and short ribs which restrict the growth and expansion of the lungs, often causing serious breathing difficulties. Other symptoms may include shortened bones in the arms and legs, unusually shaped pelvic bones, and extra fingers and/or toes. People who survive the breathing challenges of infancy, may later develop severe kidney or heart problems. In many cases the cause of Jeune syndrome is unknown; however, changes in several different genes (IFT80, DYNC2H1, WDR19, IFT140 and TTC21B) have been identified in some families with the condition. Jeune syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Aphalangy-hemivertebrae-urogenital-intestinal dysgenesis syndrome: An extremely rare congenital limb malformation syndrome, described in only 3 patients to date,characterized by the association of hypoplasia or aplasia of the hand and foot phalanges, hemivertebrae and various urogenital and/or intestinal abnormalities (i.e. dysgenesis of the urogenital tract and rectum).

"Summary of Juvenile polyposis syndrome: Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a disorder characterized by having a susceptibility to developing hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A hamartomatous polyp is a benign (noncancerous) tumor-like malformation made up of an abnormal mixture of cells and tissues. In JPS, these polyps can occur in the stomach, small intestine, colon, and rectum. The number of polyps in affected people vary. While some people may have only four or five polyps over their lifetime, others (even in the same family) may have more than 100. Most juvenile polyps are benign, although over time they can become cancerous. In families with JPS, the risk for developing a GI cancer ranges from 9% to 50%. Most of this risk is due to colon cancer. Cancers of the stomach, upper GI tract, and pancreas have also been observed. To date, genetic changes in two genes are known to cause JPS: BMPR1A and SMAD4."

"Summary of Juvenile temporal arteritis: Juvenile temporal arteritis is a rare form of vasculitis, a group of conditions that cause inflammation of the blood vessels. Unlike the classic form of temporal arteritis, this condition is generally diagnosed in late childhood or early adulthood and only affects the temporal arteries (located at the lower sides of the skull, directly underneath the temple). Affected people often have no signs or symptoms aside from a painless nodule or lump in the temporal region. The exact underlying cause of the condition is unknown. It generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 2 with or without anosmia: Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (IGD) is characterized by inappropriately low serum concentrations of the gonadotropins LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) in the presence of low circulating concentrations of sex steroids. IGD is associated with a normal sense of smell (normosmic IGD) in approximately 40% of affected individuals and an impaired sense of smell (Kallmann syndrome) in approximately 60%. IGD can first become apparent in infancy, adolescence, or adulthood. Infant boys with congenital IGD often have micropenis and cryptorchidism. Adolescents and adults with IGD have clinical evidence of hypogonadism and incomplete sexual maturation on physical examination. Adult males with IGD tend to have prepubertal testicular volume (i.e., <4 mL), absence of secondary sexual features (e.g., facial and axillary hair growth, deepening of the voice), decreased muscle mass, diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. Adult females have little or no breast development and primary amenorrhea. Although skeletal maturation is delayed, the rate of linear growth is usually normal except for the absence of a distinct pubertal growth spurt."

"Summary of Keratoderma hereditarium mutilans: Keratoderma hereditarium mutilans is an inherited condition that affects the skin. People with the ""classic form"" generally have honeycomb-patterned calluses on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (palmoplantar keratoses); constricting bands of tissue on the fingers and toes which can cause amputation; starfish-shaped, thickened skin on the tops of the fingers and knees; and hearing loss. A ""variant form"" of keratoderma hereditarium mutilans has also been identified which is characterized by ichthyosis in addition to the classic skin abnormalities and is not associated with hearing loss. Classic keratoderma hereditarium mutilans is caused by changes in the GJB2 gene and the variant form is caused by genetic changes in the LOR gene. Both are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Palmoplantar keratoderma-deafness syndrome: Palmoplantar keratoderma-deafness syndrome is a keratinization disorder characterized by focal or diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma. A patchy distribution is observed with accentuation on the thenars, hypothenars and the arches of the feet. The disease becomes apparent in infancy and is associated with sensorineural hearing loss that shows a variable age of onset. Due to genetic and clinical similarities, it has been proposed that palmoplantar keratoderma-deafness syndrome, knuckle pads-leukonychia-sensorineural deafness-palmoplantar hyperkeratosis syndrome and keratoderma hereditarium mutilans may represent variants of one broad disorder of syndromic deafness with heterogeneous phenotype. The disease is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance."
"Summary of Palmoplantar keratoderma-spastic paralysis syndrome: A rare, genetic punctate palmoplantar keratoderma disease characterized by discrete, focal, punctate keratoderma on the palms and soles and/or slowly progressive spastic paralysis, predominantly affecting the lower limbs.

"Summary of Palmoplantar keratoderma-esophageal carcinoma syndrome: Palmoplantar keratoderma-esophageal carcinoma syndrome (also known as Tylosis with esophageal cancer or TOC) is an inherited condition that increases the risk for esophageal cancer. The symptoms of TOC include thickening of the skin on the palms and soles of the feet (palmoplantar keratoderma) and white lesions inside the mouth. People with TOC are at very high risk to develop esophageal cancer. The palmoplantar keratoderma usually occurs in childhood, and esophageal cancer usually occurs in adulthood. TOC is caused by a variant in the RHBDF2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and family history. The diagnosis may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type 1: Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I is a rare condition that affects the skin. It is a sub-type of punctate palmoplantar keratoderma. Signs and symptoms typically begin in early adolescence or later and include hard, round bumps of thickened skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. These bumps can cause pain in some people. The condition is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and can be caused by a genetic change in the AAGAB gene. Some people have used surgical approaches consisting of excision and skin grafting."
"Summary of Tyrosinemia type 2: Tyrosinemia type 2 is a genetic disorder in which individuals have elevated blood levels of the amino acid tyrosine, a building block of most proteins. This condition can affect the eyes, skin, and intellectual development. Symptoms of Tyrosinemia type 2 often begin in early childhood and include excessive tearing, abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia), eye pain and redness, and painful skin lesions on the palms and soles (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis). About 50 percent of individuals with this condition have an intellectual disability. Tyrosinemia type 2 is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase, one of the enzymes required for the multi-step process that breaks down tyrosine. This enzyme shortage is caused by genetic changes in the TAT gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Seborrheic keratosis: Seborrheic keratosis is a benign (non cancerous) tumor found on the skin. Seborrheic keratoses are the most common benign tumor in older individuals. They usually appear as multiple small, flat or raised growths that range in color from white to black and are commonly found on the face, neck, chest, shoulders, and hands. They usually do not cause symptoms, but occasionally can itch and rub or catch on clothing, causing irritation. Scratching seborrheic keratoses or trying to pick them off the skin can result in a secondary infection. The cause of Seborrheic keratosis is not well understood; however, a combination of environmental factors, such as sun exposure and genetic factors may play a role."
"Summary of Kerion celsi: A rare inflammatory and suppurating type of tinea capitis, a skin infection caused by Trichophyton or Microsporum fungi, that predominantly affects the scalp and that is characterized by the development of painful crusty lesions covered with follicular pustules and surrounded by erythematous alopecic areas, that can later evolve into abscesses and leave permanent cicatricial alopecia. Lesions can be associated with regional lymphadenopathy."
"Summary of Anaplastic large cell lymphoma: Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare type of Non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymph system, part of our immune system. Non-Hodgkins lymphoma involves abnormal growth of white blood cells, either T cells or B cells. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is an aggressive cancer that usually involves the T-cells. Cancer cells in ALCL can be identified by their appearance under the microscope and by the presence of a tumor marker called CD30 or Ki-1. There are two types of ALCL, a type that affects mainly the skin (cutaneous ALCL) and a type that affects other body organs (systmic ALCL). Systemic ALCL also has two types, ALK-positive (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and ALK-negative. ALK-positive ALCL occurs more often in children and young adults. ALK-negative ALCL tends to occur in older adults. The symptoms of cutaneous ALCL include red skin lesions that break open and do not heal. Sometimes cutaneous ALCL is also found in the lymph nodes. The symptoms of systemic ALCL include fever, night sweats, and weight loss (B symptoms). The cancer can be found in the bone, soft tissue, spleen, liver and skin. The cause of ALCL is unknown. One type of ALK-negative ALCL has been associated with breast implants. ALCL is diagnosed by a biopsy of the tumor or abnormal skin and examination of the tumor cells under a microscope. Additional testing including PET scans, CT scans, MRI and a bone marrow biopsy can tell doctors if the cancer has spread to other organs.[15060"
"Summary of KID syndrome: Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare disorder that causes skin abnormalities, eye problems, and hearing loss. Skin abnormalities include thick, hard skin on the underside of the hands and feet (palmoplantar keratoderma); thick, red patches of skin (erythrokeratoderma); and dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis). Eye problems are caused by keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) which can lead to pain; sensitivity to light; extra blood vessel growth; scarring; and eventual vision loss or blindness. KID syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the GJB2 gene. Most cases are sporadic but familial cases with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported."
"Summary of Kleeblattschaedel syndrome: A form of craniosynostosis involving multiple sutures (coronal, lambdoidal, sagittal and metopic) characterized by a trilobular skull of varying severity (frontal towering and bossing, temporal bulging and a flat posterior skull), dysmorphic features (downslanting palpebral fissures, midface hypoplasia, and extreme proptosis) and that is complicated by hydrocephalus, cerebral venous hypertension, developmental delay/intellectual disability and hind brain herniation."
"Summary of Kleine-Levin syndrome: Kleine Levin syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive sleep (hypersomnia) along with cognitive and behavioral changes. Affected individuals may sleep for up to 20 hours per day during an episode. These episodes usually last for a few days to a few weeks. An episode may start abruptly and is sometimes preceded by an upper-respiratory-type infection. During an episode, people with Kleine Levin syndrome can also display abnormal behavior, such as excessive food intake (hyperphagia), irritability, childishness, disorientation, hallucinations, and an abnormally uninhibited sex drive. Affected individuals are symptom-free between episodes. The time between episodes varies. Kleine Levin syndrome primarily affects adolescent males, but it also affects females and individuals of other ages. The underlying cause of this condition is unknown. Episodes tend to decrease with advancing age. There are no consistently effective therapies, although stimulants (modafinil, methylphenidate, amphetamine) and mood stabilizers (lithium) may be prescribed with varying results."

There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1980."
"Summary of Angioosteohypertrophic syndrome: Angioosteohypertrophic syndrome is a syndrome that affects the development of blood vessels, soft tissues, and bones. This syndrome has three characteristic features: a red birthmark called a port-wine stain, overgrowth of soft tissues and bones, and vein malformations such as varicose veins or malformations of deep veins in the limbs. The overgrowth of bones and soft tissues usually begins in infancy and is most often only affects one leg. However, it can also affect the arms or sometimes the upper body area (torso). The overgrowth can cause pain, a feeling of heaviness, and make the affected leg (or arm) hard to move. Most, if not all, cases of angioosteohypertrophic syndrome are caused by somatic genetic changes in the PIK3CA gene."
"Summary of Klumpke paralysis: ""Klumpke paralysis is a rare type of birth injury to the nerves around a newborn's shoulder, known as the brachial plexus. Most types of brachial plexus injuries affect the shoulder and upper arm. Klumpke paralysis affects the movement of the lower arm and hand. Signs and symptoms include weakness and loss of movement of the lower arm and hand. Some babies experience drooping of the eyelid on the opposite side of the face as well. This symptom may also be referred to as Horner syndrome. Klumpke paralysis is caused by an injury to the nerves of the brachial plexus that which may result during birth due to a a difficult delivery. This injury can cause a stretch injury (neuropraxia), scarring, or tearing of the brachial plexus nerves. Tearing is called an """"avulsion' when the tear is at the spine, and 'rupture' when it is not. Diagnosis of Klumpke paralysis is made at birth by physical examination. Sometimes x-rays and other tests are done to determine the extent of the nerve damage. Most infants with Klumpke paralysis have the more mild form of injury (neuropraxia) and often recover within 6 months. Some infants will require surgery. Rarely, infants with Klumpke paralysis will have some permanent damage. """

"Summary of Familial partial lipodystrophy, Dunnigan type: Familial partial lipodystrophy, Dunnigan type (FPLD2) is a rare, genetic disorder that affects the amount and distribution of fat (adipose tissue) in the body. Symptoms typically develop around puberty, after having normal adipose tissue in childhood. FPLD2 causes a loss of adipose tissue from the limbs, torso, buttocks and hips, while causing a buildup of adipose tissue in the face, neck, and upper back. It may also cause increased musculature. Some people with FPLD2 have areas of dark, thick skin (acanthosis nigricans), and females may have excessive hairiness (hirsutism) and menstrual abnormalities. Metabolic abnormalities develop in adolescence or adulthood, leading to signs and symptoms that may include insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, diabetes, pancreatitis (or recurrent acute pancreatitis), liver steatosis, atherosclerosis, and an increased risk of heart disease. FPLD2 is caused by genetic changes in the LMNA gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Amelocerebrohypohidrotic syndrome: KohlschÃ¼tter-TÃ¶nz syndrome (KTS) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by the triad of amelogenesis imperfect, infantile onset epilepsy, intellectual disability with or without regression and dementia."
"Summary of Hereditary hyperekplexia: Hereditary hyperekplexia is a nervous system disorder (neurological disorder), that is usually noticed shortly after birth. Symptoms in a newborn include generalized muscle stiffness while awake (hypertonia) and exaggerated startle reflex to unexpected loud noises, visual stimuli, or touch. Following the startle reaction, infants experience a brief period in which they are very rigid and are unable to move. During these rigid periods, some infants may stop breathing (apnea), which can be fatal and has been associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). However the exaggerated startle reflex and periods of rigidity may continue throughout a person's life. Depending on the severity of the continued symptoms, a child or adult with Hereditary hyperekplexia may have an increased risk of falling or otherwise injuring themselves. In some cases, children with Hereditary hyperekplexia may have mild developmental delays. Abdominal hernias and congenital dislocation of the hip have also been associated with Hereditary hyperekplexia. Diagnosis of Hereditary hyperekplexia requires the three main features: generalized stiffness immediately after birth, excessive startle reflex to unexpected stimuli, and a short period of generalized stiffness following the startle response. Of note, the results of routine blood tests, urinalysis, brain imaging studies, or EEG are usually normal. Hereditary hyperekplexia has different inheritance patterns and is associated with changes in at least five genes. Genetic testing is available to detect the genetic changes."

"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to lactate dehydrogenase deficiency: A rare genetic glycogen storage disease characterized by either lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) M- or H-subunit deficiency. Main features of LDH M-subunit deficiency are exertional fatigue and muscle pain potentially accompanied by myoglobinuria. Some patients may develop pustular psoriasis-like skin lesions. Complications of pregnancy, such as frequent abdominal pains and increased uterine tone with a risk of dystocia have also been described. LDH H-subunit deficiency manifests with low serum LDH activity of unclear clinical relevance."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to lactate dehydrogenase M-subunit deficiency: Glycogen storage disease due to lactate dehydrogenase M-subunit deficiency is a condition that affects how the body breaks down sugar to use as energy in muscle cells. People with this condition experience fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during exercise (exercise intolerance). In some people, high-intensity exercise or other strenuous activity leads to the breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis), which can lead to myoglobinuria (rust-colored urine indicating breakdown of muscle tissue) and kidney damage. A skin rash may also develop. The severity of the signs and symptoms varies greatly among affected individuals. Glycogen storage disease due to lactate dehydrogenase M-subunit deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the LDHA gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to lactate dehydrogenase H-subunit deficiency: Glycogen storage disease due to lactate dehydrogenase H-subunit deficiency is a condition that affects how the body breaks down sugar to use as energy in muscle cells. Unlike people with glycogen storage disease due to lactate dehydrogenase H-subunit deficiency, people with this condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms. It is unclear why this condition does not cause any health problems. Affected people are usually diagnosed when routine blood tests reveal reduced activity of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Glycogen storage disease due to lactate dehydrogenase H-subunit deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the LDHB gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Fatal infantile lactic acidosis with methylmalonic aciduria: Fatal infantile lactic acidosis with methylmalonic aciduria is a rare neurometabolic disease that affects infants. It is characterized by severe encephalomyopathy (a disease that affects the brain and spnal cord and muscles), high lactic acid levels, and elevated methylmalonic acid in urine. Signs and symptoms include severe psychomotor delay and low muscle tone. It can also cause failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, and involuntary muscle contractions. Epilepsy and multiple congenital anomalies may also be present."
"Summary of Lambdoid synostosis: Familial lambdoid synostosis is a rare, genetic cranial malformation characterized by unilateral or bilateral synostosis of the lambdoid suture in multiple members of a single family.

"Summary of Ichthyosis, congenital, autosomal recessive 1: Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) is a type of skin disorder. This condition causes abnormal scaling of the skin all over the body. There are two main types of ARCI: lamellar ichthyosis (LI) and nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE). Both types can cause severe symptoms, but NCIE is more likely to cause redness and fine white scales that stick to the skin. LI causes larger, dark, and pigmented scales with no redness. Both types can cause nail problems, and NCIE can also affect the eyelids, lips, and scalp. ARCI can also cause scales to cover the entire body surface, including the folds of the skin, and can cause scarring hair loss and difficulty sweating. Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis-1 is caused by changes in the TGM1 gene and follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."

"Summary of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is the most common blood cancer. Lymphomas occur when cells of the immune system, known as B lymphocytes, grow and multiply uncontrollably. DLBCL occurs mostly in adults and is a fast-growing (aggressive) lymphoma. It can start in the lymph nodes or outside of the lymphatic system in the gastrointestinal tract, testes, thyroid, skin, breast, bone, or brain. Often, the first sign of DLBCL is a painless rapid swelling in the neck, armpit, abdomen, or groin caused by enlarged lymph nodes. For some people, the swelling may be painful. Other symptoms include night sweats, unexplained fevers, and weight loss."
"Summary of Lethal Larsen-like syndrome: A rare developmental defect with connective tissue involvement characterized by multiple joint dislocations, flattened facial appearance, abnormal palmar creases, laryngotracheomalacia, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Additional signs may include a bifid tongue, micrognathia, non-immune hydrops fetalis, and brain dysplasia. The disease is lethal shortly after birth due to respiratory insufficiency."
"Summary of Laryngotracheoesophageal cleft: A laryngotracheoesophageal cleft (also known as laryngeal cleft) is a rare malformation involving the larynx (known as the voice box) and the esophagus (known as the food pipe). Normally, when the larynx develops, it is completely separate from the esophagus so that swallowed foods travel directly through the esophagus into the stomach. A laryngotracheoesophageal cleft occurs when these structures do not develop normally in an embryo, and there is an opening connecting the larynx (and sometimes trachea) and the esophagus. This enables food and liquid that is swallowed to pass through the opening to the larynx, and into the lungs. Signs and symptoms may appear in the first few months of life and may include feeding problems, trouble swallowing, failure to thrive, reflux, coughing, wheezing, stridor, aspiration, respiratory distress, and recurrent lung infections. There are several different types of laryngotracheoesophageal clefts (types I through IV), which are classified based on the specific location and extent (severity) of the cleft. A cleft can occur as an isolated abnormality, as part of an underlying syndrome or condition (such as Opitz-Frias, VACTERL, Pallister-Hall, CHARGE), or with other associated malformations."
"Summary of Laryngocele: A rare congenital laryngeal anomaly characterized by an abnormal dilation of the laryngeal saccule that is filled with air, maintains communication with the laryngeal lumen, and is either confined to the false vocal fold or extends upward, protruding through the thyrohyoid membrane to the neck. Symptoms may include cough, hoarseness, stridor, sore throat and uni- or bilateral swelling of the neck. Blockage of the laryngocele neck can result isn laryngomucocele, and forms laryngopyocele when infected."
"Summary of Larynx, congenital partial atresia of: A congenital malformation of the larynx in which there is failure of recanalization of the laryngotracheal tube during gestation."
"Summary of Larynx atresia: A rare larynx anomaly characterized by complete absence of the laryngeal lumen resulting in congenital upper airway obstruction syndrome which, without fetal or neonatal intervention, is incompatible with life. Fetal sonography shows a dilated trachea, hyperechoic lungs, pleural effusion, minimal fetal abdominal ascites or hydrops, and amniotic fluid abnormalities."
"Summary of Graham Little-Piccardi-Lassueur syndrome: Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lassueur syndrome (GLPLS) is a rare type of scarring hair loss. It is most commonly found in otherwise healthy adult woman. GLPLS is characterized by three features: progressive patchy scarring hair loss of the scalp (cicatricial alopecia), non-scarring thinning of the hair in the armpits and groin (noncicatricial alopecia), and spiky rough bumps based around hair follicles (follicular lichen planus). Sometimes individuals with GLPLS experience itching around affected areas, which can be severe."
"Summary of Retinal cone dystrophy 1: Retinal cone dystrophy 1 is a disease that affects the cells in the eye that help people see color and detail. People with this disease may have trouble seeing clearly, be sensitive to light, and have difficulty telling colors apart. Unlike other eye diseases, people with this disease usually don't have problems seeing in the dark or losing their side vision. The disease can be passed down in families and can be caused by changes in genes. There are different types of cone dystrophy, and some may affect the cells in the center of the eye more than the cells on the edges."

"Summary of Early-onset parkinsonism-intellectual disability syndrome: A rare X-linked syndromic intellectual disability characterized by infantile-onset non-progressive intellectual deficit (with psychomotor developmental delay, cognitive impairment and macrocephaly) and early-onset parkinsonism (before 45 years of age), in male patients."
"Summary of Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome: Branchiooculofacial syndrome (BOFS) is a very rare genetic disorder that is apparent at birth. Only about 50 cases of BOFS had been reported in the medical literature. Like its name implies, BOFS is characterized by skin defects, eye abnormalities, and distinctive facial features. Among the reported cases thus far, the symptoms may vary from mild to severe. BOFS is caused by genetic changes in the TFAP2A gene and inherited as an autosomal dominant trait."

"Summary of Lenz-Majewski hyperostotic dwarfism: An extremely rare syndrome associating dwarfism, characteristic facial appearance, cutis laxa and progressive bone sclerosis."
"Summary of Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis: Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD) is a skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature and an abnormality of the wrist bones called Madelung deformity. Short stature is present from birth due to shortening of the long bones in the legs. Madelung deformity typically develops during mid-to-late childhood and may progress during puberty. People with this condition often experience pain in their wrists or arms. The severity of Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis varies among affected individuals, although the signs and symptoms of this condition are generally more severe in females. Other features of Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis can include increased muscle size, bowing of a bone in the leg called tibia, elbow abnormalities, scoliosis, and high-arched palate. Intelligence is not affected by this condition. Most cases of Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis are caused by genetic changes in or near the SHOX gene. The cause of the disorder remains unknown in those cases not related to the SHOX gene. Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis follows a pseudoautosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which is similar to the autosomal dominant inheritance. LWD is part of a group of diseases caused by deficiency of the SHOX gene, which includes a form or SHOX related short stature without additional problems."

"Summary of Lethal congenital contracture syndrome type 1: Lethal congenital contracture syndrome type 1 is a rare, genetic arthrogryposis syndrome characterized by total fetal akinesia (detectable since the 13th week of gestation) accompanied by hydrops, micrognathia, pulmonary hypoplasia, pterygia and multiple joint contractures (usually flexion contractures in the elbows and extension in the knees), leading invariably to death before the 32nd week of gestation. Lack of anterior horn motoneurons, severe atrophy of the ventral spinal cord and severe skeletal muscle hypoplasia are characteristic neuropathological findings, with no evidence of other organ structural anomalies."
"Summary of Maple syrup urine disease: Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) occurs when the body is unable to breakdown certain parts of proteins. This leads to the build-up of toxic substances that can cause organ and brain damage. There are several forms of MSUD. The most common is the classic or infantile form. Symptoms of the classic form of MSUD start in early infancy and include poor feeding, irritability, extra sleepiness, and muscle spasms. The earwax and urine of infants with MSUD smells like maple syrup. The symptoms of other forms of MSUD start in adolescence or adulthood. MSUD is caused by genetic variants in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, or DBT genes. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis of MSUD is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and blood and urine testing. MSUD is often diagnosed based on the results of a newborn screening test."
"Summary of Metachromatic leukodystrophy: Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an inherited condition characterized by the accumulation of fats called sulfatides in cells, especially cells of the nervous system. This accumulation results in progressive destruction of white matter of the brain, which consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Affected individuals experience progressive deterioration of intellectual functions and motor skills, such as the ability to walk. They also develop loss of sensation in the extremities, incontinence, seizures, paralysis, inability to speak, blindness, and hearing loss. Eventually they lose awareness of their surroundings and become unresponsive. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by genetic changes in the ARSA and PSAP genes."
"Summary of Leukoencephalopathy-palmoplantar keratoderma syndrome: Leukoencephalopathy-palmoplantar keratoderma syndrome is a rare, genetic epidermal disease characterized by early childhood-onset of punctate palmoplantar keratoderma in association with adult-onset leukoencephalopathy manifested by progressive tetrapyramidal syndrome and cognitive deterioration."
"Summary of Ophthalmoplegia-intellectual disability-lingua scrotalis syndrome: Ophthalmoplegia-intellectual disability-lingua scrotalis syndrome is a rare, genetic, syndromic intellectual disability disorder characterized by congenital, external, nuclear ophthalmoplegia, lingua scrotalis, progressive chorioretinal sclerosis and intellectual disability. Bilateral ptosis, bilateral facial weakness, Parinaud's syndrome, convergence paresis and myopia may be associated. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1975."
"Summary of Leydig cell hypoplasia: Leydig cell hypoplasia (LCH) is a disorder that impairs male sexual development. It causes incomplete development of Leydig cells, which are cells in the testicles (testes) that secrete male sex hormones (androgens). These hormones are needed for normal male sexual development as reproductive organs are forming (before birth), as well as during puberty. A genetic male with LCH has typical male chromosomes (46, XY), but due to low androgen levels, may have a range of genital differences. In a genetic male with LCH, the external genitalia may not look clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia). Specific features of LCH may include a small penis (micropenis), a urethra opening (hole) on the underside of the penis rather than at the tip (hypospadias), and a scrotum that is divided into two halves (bifid scrotum). A person with a severe form of LCH may have only female external genitalia, and small undescended testes (located in the pelvis, abdomen, or groin). Males with severe LCH may not develop secondary sex characteristics during puberty, such as increased body hair, facial hair, and a deeper voice. LCH is caused by genetic changes in the LHCGR gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. Of note: Genetic females (46, XX) can also inherit the genetic changes that cause LCH in males. Females with these genetic changes have normal female external genitalia and normal female development during puberty, but may have amenorrhea (absent periods) and infertility."
"Summary of Lichen planopilaris: Lichen planopilaris (LPP) affects the scalp and hair. It is a form of lichen planus, an inflammatory condition affecting the skin and mucous membranes. Symptoms may include scaly skin and redness around hair follicles, bald patches, and pain, burning, or itching on the scalp. Tiny, red bumps (papules) may appear around hair clusters. LLP can cause scarring which leads to permanent hair loss (cicatricial alopecia). There are 3 forms of LPP which differ by the pattern and location of symptoms: classic LPP, frontal fibrosing alopecia, and Lassueur Graham-Little Piccardi syndrome. The cause of LPP is unknown. It is thought to be an auto-immune disorder of the hair follicles. A diagnosis of LPP is made based on a clinical exam and microscopic examination of a piece of tissue from the affected area."
"Summary of Lichtenstein syndrome: A rare genetic disease characterized by frequent infections associated with neutropenia and IgA deficiency, in combination with osteoporosis and skeletal anomalies, such as posterior spinal arch fusion defect, metacarpal subluxation, syndactyly, and camptodactyly. Reported dysmorphic features include synophrys, anteverted nostrils, and single palmar crease. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1972."
Summary of Iida Kannari syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Limb body wall complex: Limb-body wall complex (LBWC) is a condition characterized by multiple, severe congenital abnormalities in a fetus. It typically results in openings in the anterior body wall (chest and belly) and defects of the limbs (arms and legs). Other features of LBWC may include facial clefts; a short or missing umbilical cord; scoliosis; neural tube defects; and abnormalities of the urogenital organs (i.e. kidney, bladder, and/or genitals). The exact cause of LBWC is unclear. The majority of affected pregnancies end in fetal demise."
"Summary of Distal limb deficiencies-micrognathia syndrome: The distal limb deficiencies-micrognathia syndrome is characterized by the combination of symmetric severe distal limb reduction deficiencies affecting all four limbs (oligodactyly), microretrognathia, and microstomia with or without cleft palate."
"Summary of Linear verrucous nevus syndrome: A rare skin disease characterized by a hamartomatous epidermal lesion presenting as a linear array of verrucous, hyperkeratotic papules that often coalesce into plaques and are formed along the lines of Blaschko. The condition is associated with involvement of other organ systems, mainly brain, eye, and skeletal system. It is the result of mosaic post-zygotic mutations and most commonly presents at birth, but may occur anytime during childhood, rarely also in adulthood."
Summary of Neutral lipid storage disease: Neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) refers to a group of diseases characterized by a deficit in the degradation of cytoplasmic triglycerides and their accumulation in cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles in most tissues of the body. The group is heterogeneous: currently cases of NLSD with icthyosis (NLSDI/Dorfman-Chanarin disease; see this term) and NLSD with myopathy (NLSDM/neutral lipid storage myopathy; see this term) can be distinguished.
Summary of Pyruvate dehydrogenase E3 deficiency: Signs and symptoms may include lactic acidosis shortly after birth; hypotonia and lethargy in infancy; feeding difficulties; seizures; and various other health issues. Liver problems can range from hepatomegaly to liver failure. Symptoms often occur in episodes that may be triggered by illness or other stresses on the body. DLD deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the DLD gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
"Summary of Lipoid proteinosis: Lipoid proteinosis (LP) of Urbach and Wiethe is a rare condition that affects the skin and the brain. The signs and symptoms of this condition and the disease severity vary from person to person. The first sign of LP is usually a hoarse cry during infancy. Damage to the temporal lobes (the portions of the brain that process emotions and are important for short-term memory) occurs over time and can lead to seizures and intellectual disability. Other signs and symptoms may include hair loss, oligodontia, speech problems, frequent upper respiratory infections, difficulty swallowing, dystonia, and learning disabilities. LP is caused by changes in the ECM1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Cobblestone lissencephaly: Cobblestone lissencephaly is an inherited condition characterized by classical lissencephaly in association with certain abnormalities of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, such as a low, sloping forehead; abnormal prominence of the back portion of the head (occiput); a broad, prominent nasal bridge; and widely set eyes (ocular hypertelorism). Additional symptoms and findings typically include severe or profound intellectual disability, seizures, abnormally increased muscle tone (hypertonia), exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), and severe growth failure. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Genetic changes in the RELN gene have been identified in some affected individuals."
"Summary of Loiasis: Loiasis is a form of filariasis (see this term), caused by the parasitic worm Loa loa, endemic to the forest and savannah regions of Central and Western Africa. Loiasis may either be asymptomatic or manifest as a large, transient area of localized, non-erythematous subcutaneous edema (Calabar swellings), adult worm migration through the sub-conjunctiva (''African eye worm'') and pruritus. Generalized itching, hives, muscle pains, arthralgias, fatigue, and adult worms visibly migrating under the surface of the skin may be observed. Severe complications such as encephalopathy have been reported in highly infected individuals receiving ivermectin during mass drug administration programs for the control of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (see these terms)."
"Summary of Romano-Ward syndrome: Romano-Ward syndrome is the most common form of inherited long QT syndrome. Symptoms include arrhythmia, fainting, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. There are six different types of this syndrome, long QT 1 through 6. Each type is caused by a change in a different gene. The most prevalent form of long QT syndrome is long QT type 1. Long QT type 1 is caused by changes in the KCNQ1 gene. Romano-Ward syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."
"Summary of Long qt syndrome 2: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac electrophysiologic disorder, characterized by QT prolongation and T-wave abnormalities on the ECG that are associated with tachyarrhythmias, typically the ventricular tachycardia torsade de pointes (TdP). TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Such cardiac events typically occur during exercise and emotional stress, less frequently during sleep, and usually without warning. In some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated) or sudden death. Approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one to a few syncopal events. While cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, they are most common from the preteen years through the 20s. Some types of LQTS are associated with a phenotype extending beyond cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to the prolonged QT interval, associations include muscle weakness and facial dysmorphism in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (LQTS type 7); hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features in Timothy syndrome (LQTS type 8); and profound sensorineural hearing loss in Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome."

Most of the cases occur in males. Lujan-Fryns syndrome is caused by changes in the MED12 gene and is inherited in an X-linked manner."
"Summary of Cerebellar ataxia-hypogonadism syndrome: Cerebellar ataxia-hypogonadism syndrome is a very rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the combination of progressive cerebellar ataxia with onset from early childhood to the fourth decade, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (delayed puberty and lack of secondary sex characteristics). Cerebellar ataxia-hypogonadism syndrome belongs to a clinical continuum of neurodegenerative disorders along with clinically overlapping disorders such as ataxia-hypogonadism-choroidal dystrophy syndrome (see this term)."
"Summary of Hennekam syndrome: Hennekam syndrome is a rare condition that affects the lymphatic system. Signs and symptoms of the condition are generally noticeable at birth and vary significantly from person to person, even within the same family. Affected people generally experience lymphangiectasia (lymphatic vessels that are abnormally expanded), lymphedema, and distinctive facial features (i.e. a flattened appearance to the middle of the face, puffy eyelids, widely spaced eyes, small ears, and a small mouth). Other common features include intellectual disability, growth delay, respiratory problems, camptodactyly (permanently bent fingers and toes) and cutaneous syndactyly (fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes). Hennekam syndrome is caused by changes in the CCBE1 or FAT4 genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Lymphangioleiomyomatosis: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (lim-FAN-je-o-LI-o-MI-o-ma-TO-sis), or LAM, is a rare cystic lung disease that mostly affects women in their mid-forties. In LAM, an unusual type of cell begins to grow out of control throughout the body, including in the lungs, lymph nodes and vessels, and kidneys. Over time, these LAM cells form cysts and clusters of cells, which grow throughout the lungs and slowly block the airways. They also destroy the normal lung tissue and replace it with cysts. As a result, air cannot move freely in and out of the lungs, and the lungs cannot supply enough oxygen to the body's other organs. Some people also develop growths called angiomyolipomas (AMLs) in the kidneys. There are two forms of LAM - a sporadic form, which occurs for unknown reasons, and a form that occurs in people with a rare, inherited disease called tuberous sclerosis complex. LAM may be difficult to diagnosis in the early stages because symptoms may be similar to other lung diseases. A high resolution CT scan is the most accurate imaging test for diagnosing LAM. Additional testing may include an abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, a VEGF-D blood test (measuring the VEGF-D hormone, which would typically be high), and a lung biopsy."
"Summary of Lymphatic filariasis: Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease caused by microscopic, thread-like worms that only live in the human lymph system, which maintains the body's fluid balance and fights infections. It is spread from person to person by mosquitoes. Most infected people are asymptomatic and never develop clinical symptoms."
"Summary of Meige disease: Meige disease is a primary lymphedema that results from abnormal transport of lymph fluid. Individuals with this condition usually develop swelling in the lower legs and feet during puberty. Some affected individuals develop a non-contagious skin infection called cellulitis, which can further damage the lymphatic vessels (the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid). While the cause of Meige disease is unknown, it is thought to be genetic because it tends to run in families. It appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Lymphatic malformation 1: Lymphatic malformation 1 is a disease that causes chronic swelling of body parts due to problems with the lymphatic system. This can happen from birth or in early childhood, but it can also occur later. The severity of the swelling can vary, and there may be changes in the nails and skin, such as nail dysplasia or papillomatosis. There are different types of primary lymphedema that are caused by changes in different genes. Additionally, lympatic malformations can also be a feature of other diseases like lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome and nonimmune hydrops fetalis."
Summary of Lymphoblastic lymphoma: A lymphoma composed of immature small to medium-sized precursor lymphoid cells (lymphoblasts). It includes the B- and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.
"Summary of Lysinuric protein intolerance: Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is a genetic condition that is caused by the body's inability to digest the amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine. These are some of the building blocks of protein. Because the body cannot effectively break down these amino acids, which are found in many protein-rich foods, individuals experience nausea and vomiting after ingesting protein. Symptoms usually develop after infants are weaned and begin to eat solid foods. Symptoms associated with protein intolerance may also occur, including short stature, muscle weakness, impaired immune function, and weak brittle bones (osteoporosis). The most serious symptoms involve the lung, kidney and heart. Lysinuric protein intolerance is caused by genetic changes in the SLC7A7 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms, laboratory and genetic testing."
"Summary of Macroglossia: Macroglossia is the abnormal enlargement of the tongue in proportion to other structures in the mouth. It usually occurs secondary to an underlying disorder that may be present from birth (congenital) or acquired. In rare cases, it is an isolated, congenital feature. Symptoms associated with Macroglossia may include drooling; speech impairment; difficulty eating; stridor; snoring; airway obstruction; abnormal growth of the jaw and teeth; ulceration; and/or dying tissue on the tip of the tongue. The tongue may protrude from the mouth. Inherited or congenital disorders associated with Macroglossia include Down syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, primary amyloidosis, and congenital hypothyroidism. Acquired causes may include trauma, cancer, endocrine disorders, and inflammatory or infectious diseases. Isolated, congenital Macroglossia can be genetic, inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a growth disorder that can affect several parts of the body. Babies and children are larger than normal usually until age 8, when growth slows down, resulting in an average height in adults. Symptoms may include one side or area of the body growing more than the other side (asymmetric growth or hemihyperplasia), omphalocele or other abdominal wall defect at birth, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), abnormally large abdominal organs, creases or pits in the skin near the ears, and kidney abnormalities. Affected children have an increased risk to develop tumors, particularly a rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor, a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma, and a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Some people only have one symptom while others may have many of the symptoms. The cause of BWS is complex and is different for different people, but involves genes that control body growth. The genes, including the CDKN1C, H19, IGF2, and KCNQ1OT1 genes, are located on chromosome 11. In most cases BWS is caused by problems with the genomic imprinting of these genes. Genomic imprinting refers to having some genes that are active (expressed) only when inherited from the father and others that are active only when inherited from the mother. Less commonly, changess in the CDKN1C gene or larger changes to chromosome 11, such as a translocation, deletion, or duplication, may cause BWS. Diagnosis of BWS is based on symptoms with the support of genetic testing. At present however, there is no clearly accepted diagnostic criteria as doctors are trying to understand the full spectrum of possible symptoms."
"Summary of Hypo- and hypermelanotic cutaneous macules-retarded growth-intellectual disabili: Hypo- and hypermelanotic cutaneous macules-retarded growth-intellectual disability syndrome is a rare, genetic pigmentation anomaly of the skin disorder characterized by congenital hypomelanotic and hypermelanotic cutaneous macules associated with, in some patients, retarded growth and intellectual disability.

Summary of Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome: Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is a rare congenital condition characterized by abdominal distension caused by a largely dilated non-obstructed urinary bladder (megacystis); very small colon (microcolon); and decreased or absent intestinal movements (intestinal peristalsis). Usual clinical presentation is similar to other neonatal intestinal obstructions: bile stained vomiting and failure to pass meconium (the first bowel movement the baby has). Other intestinal anomalies may be present like intestinal malrotation. Many problems with the urinary tract result from the bladder dysfunction. It is part of a group of conditions caused by changes in the ACTG2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However medical scientists believe that many cases of MMIHS are caused by de novo genetic changes in the ACTG2 gene (meaning the genetic change in the gene happened by mistake during the making of the sperm or egg).

Summary of Megaepiphyseal dwarfism: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts: Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a condition that affects brain development and function. Individuals with this condition have an enlarged brain (megalencephaly) and an abnormality of the white matter in the brain (leukoencephalopathy). White matter consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin that promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. In MLC, the myelin is swollen and contains numerous fluid-filled pockets (vacuoles). Over time, the swelling decreases and the myelin begins to waste away (atrophy). Leukoencephalopathy can lead to abnormal muscle tensing (spasticity), difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), cysts in the brain (subcortical cysts), abnormal muscle tone (dystonia), swallowing difficulties, mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, speech difficulties, seizures, and difficulties walking. There are three types of MLC, which are distinguished by their signs and symptoms and genetic cause. Type 1 is caused by genetic changes in the MLC1 gene. Types 2A and 2B are caused by genetic changes in the HEPACAM gene. MLC types 1 and 2A are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, while type 2B is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In some cases of MLC, the cause is unknown."

"Summary of Meningoencephalocele: Meningoencephalocele is a type of encephalocele, which is an abnormal sac of fluid, brain tissue, and meninges (membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord) that extends through a defect in the skull. There are two main types of Meningoencephalocele, which are named according to the location of the sac. The frontoethmoidal type is located at the frontal and ethmoid bones while the occipital type is located at the occipital bone. Hydrocephalus, abnormalities of the eyeball and tear duct, and other findings have been associated with the condition. Some affected individuals have intellectual or physical disabilities while others have normal development and abilities. The condition is typically congenital (present at birth) but has been reported to develop by chance in older individuals in rare cases. The underlying cause of the condition is uncertain, but environmental factors are thought to play a role."
"Summary of Myelomeningocele: Myelomeningocele occurs when the spine and spinal cord do not form correctly during early development, causing a condition known as spina bifida. Myelomeningocele is the most serious form of spina bifida. It happens when parts of the spinal cord and nerves pop out through the open part of the spine. This leads to spinal cord and spinal nerve damage and other disabilities. Symptoms of a Myelomeningocele include a decreased ability to feel sensation below the opening in the spine. Other symptoms include decreased leg movement and the inability to control the bladder and bowels. Many children with this condition develop too much fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus). The cause of Myelomeningocele is unknown. Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to be involved. Low levels of folic acid during early pregnancy are known to contribute to the occurrence of spina bifida and Myelomeningocele. During pregnancy, Myelomeningocele is often diagnosed due to an abnormal alpha fetoprotein screening test. Imaging studies such as a fetal ultrasound done during pregnancy or an MRI or CT scan done after birth are also used."
"Summary of Cerebrooculonasal syndrome: A multisystem malformation syndrome that has been reported in about 10 patients.

"Summary of Methylcobalamin deficiency type cblG: Methylcobalamin deficiency cbl G type is a rare condition that occurs when the body is unable to process certain amino acids (building blocks of protein) properly. In most cases, signs and symptoms develop during the first year of life; however, the age of onset can range from infancy to adulthood. Common features of the condition include feeding difficulties, lethargy, seizures, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental delay, microcephaly (unusually small head size), and megaloblastic anemia. Methylcobalamin deficiency cbl G type is caused by changes in the MTR gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria: Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to properly process certain nutrients from food including amino acids, lipids and cholesterol. People with this disorder have a combination of features from two separate conditions: methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria. When the condition begins early in life, babies have difficulty gaining weight (failure to thrive), feeding difficulties, and a pale appearance. Babies may also have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and seizures. Most babies and children with this condition have an unusually small head size (microcephaly), intellectual disability and developmental delay. Less common features of the condition include eye problems and a blood disorder called megaloblastic anemia. When the disorder begins in adolescence or adulthood, the signs and symptoms usually include behavior and personality changes and cognitive problems (issues with learning, memory, perception etc). In some cases, abilities are lost, resulting in a decline of performance, memory and speech problems, dementia and lethargy.[12470 Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria can be caused by genetic changes in one of several genes: MMACHC, MMADHC, LMBRD1, ABCD4, or HCFC1. Genetic changes in these genes account for the different types of the disorder, cblC, cblD, cblF, cblJ, and cblX, respectively."
"Summary of Vitamin B12-unresponsive methylmalonic acidemia: Vitamin B12-unresponsive methylmalonic acidemia (MCM deficiency) is a type of methylmalonic acidemia caused by having too little methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) is one of the special proteins (enzymes) needed to breakdown certain amino acids found in the food we eat. It is needed to breakdown certain fats too. When the amino acids and fats are not broken down normally, substances which are harmful to the body (including methylmalonic acid) build up and can damage the nervous system, kidneys and other organs. Symptoms of MCM deficiency usually begin in infancy or early childhood and may include tiredness (fatigue), vomiting, dehydration, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), fever, breathing trouble, frequent illnesses and infections, and increased bleeding and bruising. Long term complications include developmental delay, intellectual disability, enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), chronic kidney disease, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), and in severe cases coma and death. Vitamin B12-unresponsive methylmalonic acidemia is caused by changes in the MUT gene which can cause no enzyme to be produced (MUT0) or less than normal amounts of the enzyme to be made (MUT-). The more working enzyme that is made, the less severe the symptoms will be. MCM deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis is made based on symptoms, special blood tests and genetic testing. Unlike some types of methylmalonic acidurias, B12 supplements are not helpful."
"Summary of Mevalonic aciduria: Mevalonic aciduria is the severe form of mevalonate kinase deficiency, a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever that typically begin during infancy. During these fever episodes, people with Mevalonic aciduria may have an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, diarrhea, joint pain (arthralgia), and skin rashes. Additional ongoing issues include developmental delay, progressive ataxia, progressive problems with vision, an unusually small, elongated head, and failure to thrive. Mevalonic aciduria is caused by deficiency of mevalonate kinase, the first committed enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. This deficiency occurs as a result of inherited genetic changes in the MVK gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The less severe type of mevalonate kinase deficiency is called hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS)."
"Summary of Multiple benign circumferential skin creases on limbs: Multiple benign circumferential skin creases on limbs (CSC-KT) is a rare congenital disorder that affects the skin, but can also affect other areas of the body. Babies with CSC-KT are born with excess skin that folds over to form thin rings (creases) that circle the arms and legs. CSC-KT was originally called the 'Michelin tire baby syndrome' because of the similarity of the rings on the arms and legs to the cartoon mascot of the French company.  The rings on the arms and legs are usually found on both sides of the body. These skin folds do not cause any problems and typically disappear naturally as the child grows. In some cases other features are associated with CDC-KT including cleft palate, delayed growth, development delay, intellectual disability, genital abnormalities, seizures, changes in the way the brain developed (brain malformations), and/or changes in the way other organs of the body developed. Some people may have unusual facial features including narrow eye openings (blepharophimosis), very small eyes (microphthalmia) wide spaced eyes (hypertelorism), skin of the upper eyelid covering the inner corner of the eye (epicanthal folds), crossed eyes (strabismus), broad nasal bridge, low-set ears, and a very small mouth. In some cases, CSC-KT is caused by changes in the TUBB gene or in the MAPRE2 gene. CSC-KT is very rare, and there are fewer than 50 cases reported in the medical journals. Diagnosis is made based on the presence of multiple rings of folded excess skin on the arms and/or legs and other common features. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. CSC-KT caused by genetic changes in the TUBB and MAPRE2 gene may be classified under the group of diseases known as tubulinopathies, because like the genetic changes causing other tubulinopathies, genetic changes in the TUBB and MAPRE2 gene affect a cell structure known as microtubule. Problems with the development of the brain (brain malformations) are common to all the tubulinopathies. Cases of CSC-KT caused by genetic changes in the MAPRE2 gene may be more specifically called congenital symmetric circumferential skin creases-2 (CSCSC2)."
"Summary of Microbrachycephaly-ptosis-cleft lip syndrome: Microbrachycephaly-ptosis-cleft lip syndrome is characterised by the association of intellectual deficit, microbrachycephaly, hypotelorism, palpebral ptosis, a thin/long face, cleft lip, and anomalies of the lumbar vertebra, sacrum and pelvis.

"Summary of Isolated congenital microcephaly: Isolated congenital microcephaly is a rare neurological condition in which a person's head is significantly smaller than expected based on standardized charts. Some children with isolated congenital microcephaly have normal intelligence and development. However, isolated congenital microcephaly can be associated with seizures; developmental delay; intellectual disability; problems with movement and balance; feeding difficulties; hearing loss; and/or vision problems depending on the severity of the condition. Because the growth of the skull is determined by brain growth, the condition often occurs when the brain fails to grow at a normal rate. This may be caused by a variety of genetic abnormalities; exposure to certain viruses (i.e. rubella, toxoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus), drugs, alcohol, or toxic chemicals during pregnancy; untreated maternal PKU during pregnancy; and/or severe malnutrition during pregnancy."
"Summary of Microcephaly-albinism-digital anomalies syndrome: Microcephaly - albinism - digital anomalies syndrome is a very rare syndrome associating microcephaly, micrognathia, oculocutaneous albinism, hypoplasia of the distal phalanx of fingers and agenesia of the distal end of the right big toe."

"Summary of Congenital microcoria: Congenital microcoria is a rare eye disorder affecting the development of the irises. It is characterized by absence or incomplete development of the iris dilator muscles (also called the pupil dilator muscles), making the pupils unable to dilate (widen). People with Congenital microcoria have small pupils (with a diameter less than 2 millimeters) that dilate poorly or not at all, even when pupil-dilating medicines (eye drops) are put on the eye. The disorder is also often associated with nearsightedness, and glaucoma in childhood or early adulthood. Congenital microcoria that is not associated with an underlying syndrome is caused by a small, missing piece of genetic material (deletion) around a region of chromosome 13 designated as 13q32. This region contains several genes, although it appears the exact gene or genes in the region responsible for Congenital microcoria are still under investigation. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Congenital microcoria is also a feature of autosomal recessive Pierson syndrome, caused by genetic changes in the LAMB2 gene."

"Summary of Microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome: Microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome (MLS syndrome) is a genetic condition that affects the eyes and skin. It is mainly found in females and is characterized by small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia) and characteristic linear skin markings on the head and neck. The signs and symptoms of this condition may include abnormalities of the brain, heart, and genitourinary system. Other symptoms may include short stature, developmental delay, and finger and toenails that do not grow normally (nail dystrophy). MLS syndrome is typically caused by either a deletion of certain genetic material on the p (short) arm of the X chromosome or by a genetic change in the HCCS gene. In some cases, it may be caused by genetic changes in the COX7B and NDUFB11 genes, (also located on the X chromosome). This condition is inherited in an X-linked manner and is thought to result in serious early developmental concerns in males, leading to almost no males with this condition surviving to delivery."
Summary of Midline cleft of lower lip: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Miller Fisher syndrome: Miller Fisher syndrome is a rare acquired nerve disease considered to be a variant of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. The main features are lack of muscle coordination (ataxia), eye muscle weakness resulting in the inability to move the eyes in several directions (ophthalmoplegia), and the absence of tendon reflexes. Symptoms often start several days after a viral illness. Other symptoms include generalized muscle weakness and respiratory failure. The cause is not known, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease in which there are autoantibodies that attack the nerves. In most people with Miller Fisher syndrome an antibody (anti-GQ1b) is identified. The presence of these autoantibodies helps confirm the diagnosis of the syndrome."
"Summary of Miller-Dieker syndrome: Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) is a genetic condition characterized by a specific brain malformation (lissencephaly); distinctive facial features; and severe neurologic abnormalities including intellectual disability and seizures. Very few affected children survive beyond childhood. MDS is caused by a deletion (missing piece) of genetic material on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p). Most cases are not inherited and occur randomly. In some cases, it is caused by inheriting a chromosome rearrangement (balanced translocation) from an unaffected parent."
Summary of Milner Khallouf Gibson syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome: Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome is a progressive brain disorder that usually appears in infancy or early childhood. Affected children may experience vomiting, seizures, delayed development, muscle weakness, and problems with movement. Heart disease, kidney problems, and difficulty breathing can also occur in people with this disorder. Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome is a subtype of Leigh syndrome and is caused by changes in mitochondrial DNA. Genetic changes in at least 11 mitochondrial genes have been found to cause mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome. This condition has an inheritance pattern known as maternal or mitochondrial inheritance. Because mitochondria can be passed from one generation to the next only through egg cells (not through sperm cells), only females pass Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome to their children."
"Summary of Non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency: Nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency (NSHA due to HK1 deficiency) is a very rare condition mainly characterized by severe, chronic hemolysis, beginning in infancy. Approximately 20 cases of this condition have been described to date. Signs and symptoms of hexokinase deficiency are very similar to those of pyruvate kinase deficiency but anemia is generally more severe. Some affected individuals reportedly have had various abnormalities in addition to NSHA including multiple malformations, panmyelopathy, and latent diabetes. It can be caused by genetic changes in the HK1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Mirror polydactyly segmentation and limbs defects: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, encephalomyopathic form with methylmalonic: Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, encephalomyopathic form with methylmalonic aciduria (MTDPS9) affects the brain, nervous system, and muscles. Symptoms are different from person to person. They may include muscle weakness, hearing loss, and difficulty feeding and breathing. Other symptoms may include severe low muscle tone, developmental delay, and cognitive impairment. Symptoms usually begin in early infancy and get worse over time, often leading to death in infancy. MTDPS9 is caused by genetic variants in the SUCLG1 gene (also known as the SUCLA1 gene) and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, imaging studies, and the removal of a small piece of muscle for examination (muscle biopsy). The diagnosis may also be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Mitochondrial myopathy-lactic acidosis-deafness syndrome: Mitochondrial myopathy-lactic acidosis-deafness is a type of metabolic myopathy described only in two sisters to date, presenting during childhood, and characterized clinically by growth failure, severe muscle weakness, and moderate sensorineural deafness and biochemically by metabolic acidosis, elevated serum pyruvate concentration, hyperalaninemia and hyperalaninuria.

"Summary of Mitral atresia: A rare congenital non-syndromic heart malformation characterized by an imperforate or absent mitral valve. In most cases, there is a univentricular atrioventricular connection to a dominant right ventricle via a tricuspid valve, and a hypoplastic left ventricle. Morphologic heterogeneity is considerable, and hemodynamic picture and clinical manifestation depend on the type and severity of associated cardiovascular anomalies (such as ventricular septal defect or aortic atresia)."
"Summary of Familial mitral valve prolapse: A rare familial congenital mitral malformation characterized by systolic displacement of one or both mitral leaflets >2 mm beyond the annular plane into the left atrium. Typical histological findings include myxomatous degeneration and degradation of collagen and elastin. Patients may remain asymptomatic or develop complications such as severe mitral regurgitation, endocarditis, and heart failure."
"Summary of Mitral valve prolapse 1: Mitral valve prolapse 1 (MVP1) is a condition where the mitral valve in the heart doesn't work properly. It is diagnosed when the movement of the mitral leaflets exceeds 2 mm and can cause a midsystolic click and/or a late systolic murmur (both refer to specific sounds that occur during a specific phase of the heartbeat cycle). Most people with MVP1 have a normal life expectancy, but some may develop complications such as congestive heart failure, bacterial endocarditis (an infection of the inner heart lining or valves), atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rate), thromboembolism (a blood vessel blockage caused by a clot that has traveled through the blood stream), and even sudden death. MVP1 follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and is caused by changes on chromosome 16p."
"Summary of Melorheostosis with osteopoikilosis: Melorheostosis with osteopoikilosis is a rare sclerosing bone dysplasia, combining the clinical and radiological features of melorheostosis and osteopoikilosis (see these terms), that has been reported in some families with osteopoikilosis and that is characterized by a variable presentation of limb pain and deformities."

"Summary of Fryns syndrome: Fryns syndrome is a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body. Signs and symptoms vary widely among affected individuals. Many indiivduals with this condition have defects of the diaphragm such as a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (a hole in the diaphragm present at birth). This may allow the stomach and intestines to move into the chest, which can result in pulmonary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the lungs). Other signs and symptoms may include abnormalities of the fingers and toes; distinctive facial features; severe developmental delay and intellectual disability; and abnormalities of the brain, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, and genitalia. survival beyond the neonatal period is rare. The cause of Fryns syndrome is not known, but it is thought to be genetic and appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

"Summary of Distal monosomy 10q: Distal monosomy 10q is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 10. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with distal monosomy 10q include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children."
"Summary of Chromosome 14q deletion: Chromosome 14q deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing (deleted) copy of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 14. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 14q deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation, where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a deletion."
Summary of Mosaic monosomy 18: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Chromosome 1p deletion: Chromosome 1p deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 1. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 1p deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children."
"Summary of 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome: Chromosome 1q41-q42 deletion syndrome is characterized by a small, but variable deletion in a particular place on the long arm of one copy of chromosome 1, usually spanning several genes. There have been variable features described in the literature, and individuals have ranged from being mildly to severely affected. Features may include poor feeding in infancy; developmental delay including delayed or absent speech; and moderate to severe intellectual disability. Other features may include hypotonia; short stature; seizures; heart defects; structural brain anomalies (most commonly underdevelopment of the corpus callosum); genitourinary abnormalities; cleft palate; microcephaly; vision problems; hearing loss; and other abnormalities. Some may have characteristic facial features."
"Summary of Chromosome 20p deletion: Chromosome 20p deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing (deleted) copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 20. The severity and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Extremely small deletions (microdeletions) involving the distal end of chromosome 20p are relatively common and in some cases are passed from parent to child without causing any health problems (called a familial variant). In other cases, a 20p deletion causes signs and symptoms such as developmental delay, growth delay, learning difficulties, distinctive facial features, birth defects, and/or various medical problems. Some 20p deletions are not inherited and occur randomly during the formation of egg or sperm cells, or very early in fetal development. Other 20p deletions are present because a parent has a rearrangement of genetic material on his/her chromosomes. This rearrangement is usually a balanced translocation, which typically does not cause any health problems. Occasionally, a parent has the same deletion as his/her child. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide information about whether the deletion was inherited. If a parent has the same deletion as the child and does not have signs or symptoms, a genetics doctor usually assumes that the 20p deletion is not the cause of the child's signs and symptoms."
"Summary of Chromosome 2q deletion: Chromosome 2q deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 2. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved.

"Summary of Mucopolysaccharidosis type 4A: Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA, also called Morquio syndrome, type A) is a metabolic condition that primarily affects the skeleton. The severity, age of onset, and associated symptoms vary significantly from person to person and range from a severe and rapidly progressive, early-onset form to a slowly progressive, later-onset form. The more severe form is usually diagnosed between ages 1 and 3, while the milder form may not become evident until late childhood or adolescence. Symptoms include various skeletal abnormalities such as short stature, knock knees, pectus carinatum, and malformations of the spine, hips and wrists. There may be involvement of other organ systems such as respiratory problems, valvular heart disease, hearing impairment, corneal clouding, dental abnormalities, hepatomegaly, and spinal cord compression. MPS IVA is caused by changes in the GALNS gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Mucopolysaccharidosis type 4B: GLB1-related disorders comprise two phenotypically distinct lysosomal storage disorders: GM1 gangliosidosis and mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB (MPS IVB). GM1 gangliosidosis includes phenotypes that range from severe to mild. Type I (infantile) begins before age one year; progressive central nervous system dysfunction leads to spasticity, deafness, blindness, and decerebrate rigidity. Life expectancy is two to three years. Type II can be subdivided into the late-infantile form and juvenile form. Type II, late-infantile form begins between ages one and three years; life expectancy is five to ten years. Type II, juvenile form begins between ages three and ten years with insidious plateauing of motor and cognitive development followed by slow regression. Type II may or may not include skeletal dysplasia. Type III begins in the second to third decade with extrapyramidal signs, gait disturbance, and cardiomyopathy; and can be misidentified as Parkinson disease. Intellectual impairment is common late in the disease; skeletal involvement includes short stature, kyphosis, and scoliosis of varying severity. MPS IVB is characterized by skeletal changes, including short stature and skeletal dysplasia. Affected children have no distinctive clinical findings at birth. The severe form is usually apparent between ages one and three years, and the attenuated form in late childhood or adolescence. In addition to skeletal involvement, significant morbidity can result from respiratory compromise, obstructive sleep apnea, valvular heart disease, hearing impairment, corneal clouding, and spinal cord compression. Intellect is normal unless spinal cord compression leads to central nervous system compromise."

Summary of MSBD syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Mucolipidosis type III: Mucolipidosis III (ML III) is a rare and progressive metabolic disorder that involves our body's ability to break down certain fats (mucolipids). Symptoms typically present around age 3 and include developmental delay, joint pain, thickened skin, heart valve abnormalities, and intellectual disabilities or learning problems. Many individuals with ML III develop low bone density (osteoporosis), which causes pain and may lead to bone fractures. Heart deformities and repeated respiratory infections can reduce the individual's ability to breathe effectively and may result in death during mid-adulthood. ML III is caused by genetic change in the GNPTAB gene, and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Mucolipidosis III is diagnosed by testing the blood or urine for high levels of mucolipids, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Mucopolysaccharidosis type 3: Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III) is a genetic disorder that makes the body unable to break down large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs, formerly called mucopolysaccharides).

"Summary of Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1) causes the growth of tumors in both the endocrine system (the body's network of hormone-producing glands) and non-endocrine system. Symptoms of MEN1 include tumors of the parathyroid gland, the pituitary gland, and the pancreas, although other glands may be involved as well. These tumors are often ""functional"" and secrete excess hormones, which can cause a variety of health problems. Additional signs and symptoms of MEN1 may depend on the type of tumor present and which hormones are being secreted. The most common symptoms are cause by an overactive parathyroid gland and may include kidney stones; thinning of bones; nausea and vomiting; high blood pressure (hypertension); weakness; and fatigue. MEN1 is caused by genetic variants in the MEN1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is diagnosed based on the presence of two or more endocrine tumors in one person. The results of genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an inherited disorder in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or form a tumor. Endocrine glands most commonly involved include: Adrenal (about half the time)      Parathyroid (20% of the time)      Thyroid (almost all of the time)   MEN2 is caused by a defect in the RET gene. This defect causes many tumors to appear in the same person, but not necessarily at the same time. The adrenal tumor is called a pheochromocytoma, and the thyroid tumor is a medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The condition is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The features of this disorder are relatively consistent within any one family."

"Summary of Lethal multiple pterygium syndrome: Lethal multiple pterygium syndrome (LMPS) is a very rare genetic condition affecting the skin, muscles and skeleton. It is characterized by minor facial abnormalities, prenatal growth deficiency, spine defects, joint contractures, and webbing (pterygia) of the neck, elbows, back of the knees, armpits, and fingers. Fetuses with this condition are usually not born. Some of the prenatal complications include cystic hygroma, hydrops, diaphragmatic hernia, polyhydramnios, underdevelopment of the heart and lungs, microcephaly, bone fusions, joint dislocations, spinal fusion, and bone fractures. Both X-linked and autosomal recessive inheritance have been proposed. Genetic changes in the CHRNG, CHRNA1, and CHRND genes have been found to cause this condition."

Other symptoms may include calf hypertrophy (enlarged calf muscles), cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), respiratory impairment (difficulty breathing), tendon contractures (stiff joints), scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and exercise-induced myoglobinuria (muscle pain and weakness after exercise)."
Summary of Muscular dystrophy white matter spongiosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Muscular dystrophy, congenital, merosin-positive: The congenital muscle dystrophies are currently classified according to the genetic defects. Historically, congenital muscular dystrophies were classified in two broad groups: Classic CMD (which included the Merosin-deficient CMD and the Merosin-positive CMD) and the CMD with central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities (Fukuyama CMD, muscle-eye-brain disease and Walker-Warburg syndrome). Therefore, merosin-positive congenital muscle dystrophy (CMD) is now considered an old term which refers to a group of diseases without structural brain abnormalities that are caused by a variety of genetic changes, resulting in protein defects that do not affect the merosin protein. It usually has a milder phenotype than the merosin-negative CMD dystrophy group and includes, among others: Classic CMD without distinguishing features Rigid spine syndrome associated with genetic changes in the selenoprotein N1 gene (SEPN1) CMD with hyperextensible distal joints (Ullrich type) CMD with intellectual disability or sensory abnormalities. The pattern of muscle weakness and wasting in the patients within this group of congenital muscular dystrophy conditions is worse in the proximal upper limb-girdle and trunk muscles. Lower limb muscles may be mildly involved. Muscle biopsy shows a dystrophic pattern with normal staining for dystrophin, laminin alpha-2 of merosin and the sarcoglycans."

Classic FD is characterized by onset in the first weeks of life of painful, progressive deformity of the major joints; palpable subcutaneous nodules of joints and mechanical pressure points; and a hoarse cry resulting from granulomas of the larynx and epiglottis. Life expectancy is usually less than two years. In the other less common types of FD, onset, severity, and primary manifestations vary. SMA-PME is characterized by early-childhood-onset progressive lower motor neuron disease manifest typically between ages three and seven years as proximal lower-extremity weakness, followed by progressive myoclonic and atonic seizures, tremulousness/tremor, and sensorineural hearing loss. Myoclonic epilepsy typically begins in late childhood after the onset of weakness and can include jerking of the upper limbs, action myoclonus, myoclonic status, and eyelid myoclonus. Other findings include generalized tremor, and cognitive decline. The time from disease onset to death from respiratory complications is usually five to 15 years."
"Summary of Progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1: Progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1 (also known as Unverricht-Lundborg disease or ULD) is an inherited form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy, a neurodegenerative disorder. Early symptoms include involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (stimulus-sensitive myoclonus) and tonic-clonic seizures. Episodes of myoclonus may be brought on by exercise, stress, light, or other stimuli (triggers). Over time, people with ULD develop ataxia, lack of coordination, intention tremor, and difficulty speaking (dysarthria). People with ULD may also develop emotional sensitivity, depression, and a mild impairment of intellectual performance over time. ULD is caused by genetic changes in the CSTB gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing."

Mitochondria are specialized compartments in cells that create more than 90% of the energy needed by the body. In mitochondrial diseases, the mitochondria don't work correctly resulting in less energy in the cell, cell injury and cell death. Complex I is the first step in a chain reaction in mitochondria leading to energy production. Features may include macrocephaly (large head) with progressive leukodystrophy, encephalopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leigh syndrome, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson disease. The disease is caused by genetic changes in any of many genes and the inheritance pattern depends on the responsible gene."

"Summary of Neuronal intestinal pseudoobstruction: Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a condition characterized by impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract. It can occur at any time of life, and its symptoms range from mild to severe. The condition may arise from abnormalities of the gastrointestinal muscles themselves (myogenic) or from problems with the nerves that control the muscle contractions (neurogenic).Intestinal pseudo-obstruction leads to a buildup of partially digested food in the intestines. This buildup can cause abdominal swelling (distention) and pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation or diarrhea. Affected individuals experience loss of appetite and impaired ability to absorb nutrients, which may lead to malnutrition. These symptoms resemble those of an intestinal blockage (obstruction), but in intestinal pseudo-obstruction no blockage is found.Depending on the cause of intestinal pseudo-obstruction, affected individuals can have additional signs and symptoms. Some people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction have bladder dysfunction such as an inability to pass urine. Other features may include decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) or stiffness (spasticity) of the torso and limbs, weakness in the muscles that control eye movement (ophthalmoplegia), intellectual disability, seizures, unusual facial features, or recurrent infections.When intestinal pseudo-obstruction occurs by itself, it is called primary or idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The disorder can also develop as a complication of another health problem; in these cases, it is called secondary intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The condition can be episodic (acute) or persistent (chronic)."

"Summary of Congenital isolated hyperinsulinism: Congenital hyperinsulinism is a disease where there are abnormally high levels of insulin, a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas that helps control blood sugar levels. Because of the high levels of insulin, people with this disease have frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) that can even occur after eating. In babies and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma. Congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by genetic changes in at least 11 different genes, including ABCC8 (responsible for about 45 % of the cases), KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HK1, HADH, HNF4A, HNF1A, SLC16A1, UCP2, and PGM1. Inheritance may be autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant. Some cases are caused by loss of genetic material in a region of chromosome 11 (11p15) that comes from the mother (maternal chromosome). According to the extent of abnormal beta cells, the disease can be focal (when abnormal beta cells are limited to 1 or a few areas in the pancreas) and diffuse (where the abnormal beta cells are spread throughout the pancreas)."

"Summary of Visceral neuropathy familial: Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a condition characterized by impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract. It can occur at any time of life, and its symptoms range from mild to severe. The condition may arise from abnormalities of the gastrointestinal muscles themselves (myogenic) or from problems with the nerves that control the muscle contractions (neurogenic).Intestinal pseudo-obstruction leads to a buildup of partially digested food in the intestines. This buildup can cause abdominal swelling (distention) and pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation or diarrhea.

"Summary of Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a slowly progressive, neurodegenerative disease. NIID may affect any part of the nervous system (central, peripheral, and/or autonomic), as well as various organs. Therefore, people with NIID may have impairment of balance, movement, cognition, communication, behavior, and the ability to function independently. In general, limb weakness and ataxia are more common in children with NIID, while dementia is more common in people diagnosed in adulthood. The features of NIID result from the presence of eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions inside neurons and glial cells (abnormal masses of substances in the nuclei of cells of the nervous system). Recently, a genetic change in the NOTCH2NLC gene has been found to cause NIID."

"Summary of Maternally-inherited diabetes and deafness: Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) is a form of diabetes that is often accompanied by hearing loss, especially of high tones. MIDD is caused by genetic changes in the MT-TL1, MT-TK, or MT-TE gene. These genes are found in mitochondrial DNA, which is part of cellular structures called mitochondria. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the cell nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). Because the genes involved with MIDD are found in mitochondrial DNA, this condition is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only females pass mitochondrial conditions to their children. Mitochondrial disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass mitochondrial traits to their children."
"Summary of Progressive epilepsy-intellectual disability syndrome, Finnish type: Progressive epilepsy-intellectual disability syndrome, Finnish type is a rare condition that affects the nervous system.

They may include wedge-shaped calcium deposits at the base of the skull (occipital horns), loose skin and joints, and dysfunction of the nerves that regulate nonvoluntary body functions (dysautonomia). Other symptoms may include bladder diverticula, coarse hair, low muscle tone, and mild intellectual disability. This condition is a milder form of Menkes disease, which affects copper levels in the body. OHS is caused by genetic changes (DNA variants) in the ATP7A gene, and it is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. It can be diagnosed based on the symptoms, genetic testing, and other blood tests."
"Summary of Primary tethered cord syndrome: Tethered cord syndrome is a rare neurological condition. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary from person to person. Features of the condition may include foot and spinal abnormalities; weakness in the legs; loss of sensation (feeling) in the lower limbs; lower back pain; scoliosis; and urinary incontinence. Infants and children with congenital Tethered cord syndrome may also have tufts of hair, dimples, skin discoloration, or benign fatty tumors on the lower back. Tethered cord syndrome occurs when tissue attachments limit the movement of the spinal cord within the spinal column. In some cases, it may be the result of improper growth of the neural tube during fetal development, which is closely linked to spina bifida. Other potential causes include narrowing of the spinal column (with age), spinal cord injury, tumors, and infection."

"Summary of Oculocutaneous albinism type 1: Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 is a condition that affects the coloring of the skin, hair, and eyes. Signs and symptoms include very fair skin, white hair, an increased risk for skin damage with sun exposure, reduced vision (sharpness), light colored irises, nystagmus, and photophobia (eyes are sensitive to light). It is caused by changes in the TYR gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Oculocutaneous albinism type 2: Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 is a genetic condition that affects the coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Affected individuals typically have very fair skin and white or light-colored hair. Long-term sun exposure greatly increases the risk of skin damage and skin cancers, including an aggressive form of skin cancer called melanoma, in people with this condition. This condition also reduces pigmentation of the colored part of the eye (the iris) and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). People with this condition usually have vision problems such as reduced sharpness; nystagmus and strabismus; and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). This condition is caused by genetic changes in the OCA2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Oculocutaneous albinism type 3: Oculocutaneous albinism is a group of conditions that affect coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Affected individuals typically have very fair skin and white or light-colored hair. Long-term sun exposure greatly increases the risk of skin damage and skin cancers, including an aggressive form of skin cancer called melanoma, in people with this condition. Oculocutaneous albinism also reduces pigmentation of the colored part of the eye (the iris) and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). People with this condition usually have vision problems such as reduced sharpness; rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia).Researchers have identified multiple types of oculocutaneous albinism, which are distinguished by their specific skin, hair, and eye color changes and by their genetic cause. Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 is characterized by white hair, very pale skin, and light-colored irises. Type 2 is typically less severe than type 1; the skin is usually a creamy white color and hair may be light yellow, blond, or light brown. Type 3 includes a form of albinism called rufous oculocutaneous albinism, which usually affects dark-skinned people. Affected individuals have reddish-brown skin, ginger or red hair, and hazel or brown irises. Type 3 is often associated with milder vision abnormalities than the other forms of oculocutaneous albinism. Type 4 has signs and symptoms similar to those seen with type 2.Several additional types of this disorder have been proposed, each affecting one or a few families."

"Summary of Cloacal exstrophy: OEIS complex, also known as cloacal exstrophy, is the most severe birth defect within the exstrophy-epispadias complex. It is characterized by Omphalocele, Exstrophy, Imperforate anus and Spinal defects. A child with this condition will have the bladder and a portion of the intestines exposed outside the abdomen with the bony pelvis open like a book. In males, the penis is either flat and short or sometimes split. In females, the clitoris is split and there may be two vaginal openings. Also, frequently the intestine is short and the anus is not open (anus imperforate). There is a high association with other birth defects, especially spina bifida, which occurs in up to 75% of cases. Omphalocele, a defect of the abdominal wall in the region of the umbilicus, is also common, as are kidney abnormalities. The defect occurs when the baby is developing inside the uterus during the first trimester of pregnancy, and seems to be due to the rupture of a tissue known as the cloacal membrane which results in the abnormal development of the abdominal wall and other malformations. The timing of the rupture determines the severity of the disorder. The cause for this malformation is unknown."

"Summary of Orofaciodigital syndrome type 1: Orofaciodigital syndrome 1 (OFD1), also called orofaciodigital syndrome type 1, is a condition that affects the development of the oral cavity (the mouth and teeth), facial features, and digits (fingers and toes). This condition also causes polycystic kidney disease. Orofaciodigital syndrome 1 is caused by a change in a gene called OFD1 which appears to play an important role in the early development of many parts of the body including the brain, face, limbs, and kidneys. The syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The diagnosis of OFD1 is sometimes made at birth, but it may be suspected only after polycystic kidney disease is found in later childhood or adulthood. OFD1 is the most common form of orofaciodigital syndrome and differs from the other types mainly by its association with polycystic kidney disease."

(2008) and Ralston and Albagha (2014).Genetic Heterogeneity of Paget Disease of BoneAlso see PDB2 (602080), caused by mutation in the TNFRSF11A gene (603499) on chromosome 18q21; PDB4 (606263), mapped to chromosome 5q31; PDB5 (239000), caused by mutation in the TNFRSF11B gene (602643) on chromosome 8q24; and PDB6 (616833), caused by mutation in the ZNF687 gene (610568) on chromosome 1q21.Suggestive linkage of a form of PDB to chromosome 6p (PDB1) was reported by Fotino et al. (1977); however, further studies did not confirm linkage to this site (Moore and Hoffman, 1988; Nance et al., 2000; Good et al., 2001)."
"Summary of Extramammary Paget disease: Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is characterized by a chronic eczema-like rash of the skin around the genital regions of males and females. Under the microscope, this condition looks very similar to a condition that occurs on the breast called mammary Paget disease. The primary difference between the two is the location of the rash. While the location of the rash for individuals with mammary Paget disease is around the nipple and areolar skin, EMPD may occur in the vulva, perianal region, scrotum, penis, and axilla. About 25 percent of Extramammary Paget disease is associated with an underlying cancer."

"Summary of Hydrocephaly-low insertion umbilicus syndrome: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized by congenital hydrocephalus involving the lateral ventricles, low-set umbilicus, bilateral inguinal hernia, and mild facial dysmorphism (such as epicanthal folds, broad, flat nasal bridge, and small, bulbous nose). Additional reported manifestations include unilateral cryptorchidism, vesicoureteral reflux, and tetralogy of Fallot. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1993."
Summary of Partial pancreatic agenesis: Partial agenesis of the pancreas is characterized by the congenital absence of a critical mass of pancreatic tissue.
"Summary of Adenoma of pancreas: A rare, benign tumor of the pancreas characterized by variable number and size of the cysts lined with glycogen rich epithelial cells. Clinical manifestation may include epigastric or abdominal pain, weight loss, diabetes, jaundice and palpable abdominal mass. Some patients have no symptoms and the tumor is discovered incidentally."
"Summary of Familial pancreatic carcinoma: Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) is the occurrence of pancreatic cancer in two or more first-degree relatives (parent and child, or two siblings). It is sometimes referred to as FPC only when there is not a known hereditary cancer syndrome in an affected family. In 60% of cases it occurs within the head of the pancreas. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer are generally non-specific and may include pain in the upper abdomen that radiates to the back; loss of appetite; significant weight loss; and jaundice due to bile duct obstruction. Pancreatic cancer often goes undetected until the advanced stages of the disease, and rapid tumor growth and metastasis are common. A specific genetic cause of FPC (in the absence of a known syndrome) has not been identified. Familial cases of pancreatic cancer due to hereditary conditions may be caused by genetic changes in any of several genes. Individuals who carry a genetic change in one of these genes are often at an increased risk of other types of cancers as well. In many cases, inheritance of a predisposition to develop FPC is autosomal dominant. In some cases, is may be multifactorial."

Summary of Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Papilloma of choroid plexus: Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) ia a non-cancerous (benign) tumor of the choroid plexus, a network of blood vessels in the brain which surrounds the ventricles and produces the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF). CPPs most commonly occur in children but may occur in adults. Symptoms are generally due to increased secretion of CSF by tumor cells, causing hydrocephalus and subsequent intracranial pressure. Affected individuals may experience headaches, nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, ocular or gaze palsies, optic nerve swelling (papilledema), visual disturbances, and possible blindness. Infants, especially those with a tumor in the third ventricle, can present with hydrocephalus or macrocephaly. Some cases of CPP may result from a genetic change in the TP53 gene."
"Summary of Parainfluenza virus type 3: Parainfluenza virus type 3 is one of a group of common viruses known as human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) that cause a variety of respiratory illnesses. Symptoms usually develop between 2 and 7 days from the time of exposure and typically resolve in 7-10 days.  Symptoms may include fever, runny nose, and cough. HPIV-3 can also cause bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Infants and young children are particularly susceptible to HPIV-3 infections, though older adults and those with a weakened immune system are also at risk for complications. HPIVs are usually spread from an infected person to others through coughing, sneezing, and/or touching. Most adults have antibodies against parainfluenza but can get repeat infections."

"Summary of Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia: Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia (TCPT) is a contiguous gene syndrome characterized by mild bleeding tendency, variable thrombocytopenia (THC), dysmorphic facies, abnormal giant alpha-granules in platelets and dysmegakaryopoiesis."
"Summary of Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, non Brugada type: A rare, genetic, cardiac rhythm disease characterized by ventricular fibrillation in the absence of any structural or functional heart disease, or known repolarization abnormalities. The presence of J waves is associated with a higher risk of nocturnal ventricular fibrillation events and a higher risk of recurrence."
"Summary of Neuralgic amyotrophy: Parsonage Turner syndrome (PTS) is characterized by the sudden onset of shoulder and upper arm pain followed by progressive (worsening over time) weakness and/or atrophy of the affected area. The pain is felt along the path of one or more nerves and often has no obvious physical cause. The network of nerves involved in this syndrome is called the brachial plexus and it controls movement and sensation in the shoulders and arms. The cause is still unknown (idiopathic). Suspected triggers include viral and bacterial infections, surgery, vaccinations, injury, childbirth, strenuous exercise, certain medical procedures, and various health conditions. PTS is one of two forms of neuralgic amyotrophy. The other form is hereditary and is caused by genetic changes in the SEPT9 gene in about 85% of cases."
"Summary of Partial atrioventricular septal defect: A rare congenital cardiac malformation that is a variant of an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) with an interatrial communication (ostium primum defect) just above the common atrioventricular (AV) valve, no interventricular communication just below the atrioventricular valve, a common atrioventricular junction but separate right and left atrioventricular valvar orifices, and a three-leaflet, left-sided component of the common atrioventricular valve (''cleft''). Shunting is restricted to the atrial level because of fusion of the leaflets of the common AV valve with the crest of the ventricular septum."
"Summary of Partial deletion of Y: A severe deficiency of spermatogenesis. Chromosome Y deletions are a frequent genetic cause of male infertility. The mode of transmission follows a Y-linked pattern, with incomplete penetrance, but as deletions are often associated with infertility, they generally occur de novo. Molecular diagnosis is made by PCR amplification of STS type sequences (sequence-tagged sites) from the AZFa, b, and c regions. All chromosome Y deletions do not necessarily lead to infertility: firstly, some deletions (especially some partial deletions) do not result in spermatogenesis defects; secondly, among men with severe oligospermia, some can father children without infertility treatment. Finally, when mature spermatozoa are found in the sperm or in the testicles, the infertility problem can be solved with medically assisted procreation techniques. However, there is a risk of transmitting the microdeletion to every male infant."
"Summary of Partington syndrome: Partington syndrome is a rare neurological condition that is primarily characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability and dystonia of the hands. Other signs and symptoms may include dysarthria, behavioral abnormalities, recurrent seizures and/or an unusual gait (style of walking). Partington syndrome usually occurs in males; when it occurs in females, the signs and symptoms are often less severe. It is caused by changes in the ARX gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner."
"Summary of Fetal parvovirus syndrome: Fetal parvovirus syndrome is a fetopathy likely to occur when a pregnant woman is infected by parvovirus B19. In adults, the virus causes a butterfly erythema infectiosum (also called Fifth Disease; 'slapped cheek disease') and flu-like symptoms with symmetric polyarthralgias, which usually do not warrant prenatal diagnosis."

"Summary of Patterson-Stevenson-Fontaine syndrome: Patterson-Stevenson-Fontaine syndrome is a very rare syndrome characterized by abnormal development of the bones and tissues of the face (mandibulofacial dysostosis) and limb abnormalities. Physical features of this condition may include a recessed jaw (retrognathism), cleft palate, and anomalies of the external ears. Limb abnormalities may include the absence of toes, clefts in the feet, and fusion of toes together (syndactyly). These limb abnormalities together are known as split-foot deformity or ectrodactyly. Patterson-Stevenson-Fontaine syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Diagnosis of the condition may be based on seeing symptoms in an individual that are consistent with the syndrome."
Summary of Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: A rare inflammatory rheumatic disease characterized by juvenile onset arthritis that affects fewer than 5 joints during the first 6 months after disease onset.
"Summary of PEHO syndrome: PEHO (Progressive encephalopathy with Edema, Hypsarrhythmia and Optic atrophy) syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disorder belonging to the group of infantile progressive encephalopathies."
"Summary of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is a disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord.

"Summary of Pendred syndrome: Pendred syndrome is a condition usually characterized by sensorineural hearing loss in both ears (bilateral) and euthyroid goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland with normal thyroid gland function). The amount of hearing loss varies among affected people. Some people have problems with balance caused by dysfunction of the part of the inner ear that helps with balance and orientation (the vestibular system). Pendred syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Genetic changes in 3 genes are currently known to cause the condition (SLC26A4, FOXI1, and KCNJ10) and are found in about half of affected people. Other genes responsible for the condition have not yet been identified."
"Summary of Penile agenesis: Penile agenesis is a rare urogenital tract malformation characterized by complete congenital absence of the phallus. It is usually accompanied by a well-developed scrotum and presence of a skin tag at the anal verge (with or without a urethral meatal opening within it). Often, other genitourinary (e.g. cryptorchidism, renal agenesis and dysplasia, urinary reflux, prostate agenesis) as well as non-genitourinary abnormalities (including skeletal and neural disorders, anal stenosis, imperforate anus, cardiac defects) are associated."
"Summary of Penoscrotal transposition: A rare congenital genital anomaly in which the scrotum is positioned superior and anterior to the penis. PST may present with a broad spectrum of anomalies ranging from simple shawl scrotum (doughnut scrotum) to very complex extreme transposition with craniofacial, central nervous system, cardiac, gastrointestinal, urological, and other genital (undescended testicles, hypospadias, chordee) malformations. Growth deficiency and intellectual disability may also be noticed (60% of cases)."

Craniofacial features include a thin calvarium, delayed closure of the anterior fontanel, flat occiput, shallow orbits, malar hypoplasia and narrow nose."
"Summary of Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase deficiency, cytosolic: PEPCK1 deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism disorder, characterized by the deficiency of the enzyme PEPCK1, one of the enzymes needed for gluconeogenesis, the process by which organisms produce sugars (namely glucose) from non-carbohydrate precursors (such as amino acids). In severe cases, symptoms may include persistent and very low levels of blood's sugar in newborns (neonatal hypoglycemia), failure to thrive, build-up of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis), liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) and liver failure leading to neurological degeneration. Milder cases present during childhood with fewer and less serious liver problems. Infections and fasting may trigger the symptoms. PEPCK1 deficiency inheritance is autosomal recessive. It is caused by genetic changes in the PEPCK1 gene. PEPCK1 is the cytosolic form of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) enzyme, the other being the mitochondrial (PEPCK2)."
"Summary of Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase deficiency, mitochondrial: This section is currently in development."

"Summary of Phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica: Phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica (PPK) is a very rare epidermal nevus disorder characterized by the association of speckled lentiginous nevi with epidermal sebaceous nevi, and extracutaneous anomalies."
"Summary of Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis: Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) is a disorder characterized by the co-existence of vascular and pigmentary birthmarks. Signs and symptoms may include port wine stain, melanocytic nevi (commonly known as moles), epidermal nevi, dermal melanocytosis (areas of blue-gray discoloration), nevus spilus, and patches of hyperpigmentation (areas of darker skin). Other skin features may include nevus anemicus (areas of lighter skin) and cafÃ© au lait spots. About half of people with PPV have systemic involvement, which means they have features affecting other areas of the body. People with systemic involvement may have neurologic, ocular (eye), or muscular abnormalities. Isolated PPV is typically a sporadic disorder that occurs for the first time in people with no family history of PPV. PPV can be caused by a somatic genetic change in the GNA11 or GNAQ gene that is present only in the affected tissues of the body. These genetic changes are not present in the blood or in unaffected tissues, which means the disorder is likely due to non-inherited genetic changes that are randomly acquired after conception. In some cases of isolated PPV, the underlying cause remains unknown."
"Summary of Phenobarbital embryopathy: A teratologic disorder associated with intrauterine exposure of phenorbarbital during the first trimester of pregnancy. Infants are usually asymptomatic but an increased risk of intellectual disability, tetralogy of Fallot, unilateral cleft lip, hypoplasia of the mitral valve and some other mild abnormalities such as hypertelorism, epicanthus, hypoplasia and low insertion of the nose, low insertion of the ears, prognathism, ï¬nger hypoplasia, brachydactyly and hypospadias have been reported in rare cases."
"Summary of Dihydropteridine reductase deficiency: Dihydropteridine reductase deficiency (DHPR) is a severe form of hyperphenylalaninemia (high levels of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood) due to impaired renewal of a substance known as tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Tetrahydrobiopterin normally helps process several amino acids, including phenylalanine, and it is also involved in the production of neurotransmitters. If little or no tetrahydrobiopterin is available to help process phenylalanine, this amino acid can build up in the blood and other tissues and the levels of neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin) and folate in cerebrospinal fluid are also decreased. This results in neurological symptoms such as psychomotor delay, low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, abnormal movements, too much salivation, and swallowing difficulties. DHPR deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the QDPR gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Pheochromocytoma-islet cell tumor syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Phocomelia-ectrodactyly-deafness-sinus arrhythmia syndrome: Phocomelia-ectrodactyly-deafness-sinus arrhythmia syndrome is characterised by phocomelia (involving arms more severely), ectrodactyly, ear anomalies (bilateral anomalies of the pinnae), conductive deafness, dysmorphism (long and prominent philtrum, mild maxillary hypoplasia) and sinus arrhythmia. It has been described in four patients (a father and his son and a mother and her daughter) from two unrelated families."
"Summary of PGM1-CDG: There are many steps in glycosylation, each of which is controlled by a different gene. The type of CDG a person has depends on which gene is involved. The signs and symptoms of PGM1-CDG can be different from person to person. They may include cleft palate or bifid uvula; low blood sugar (hypoglycemia); endocrine disorders; muscle disease, leading to muscle weakness or death of muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis); liver disease; blood clotting problems; and a weak and enlarged heart chamber (dilated cardiomyopathy). Some people with PGM1-CDG have central nervous system involvement such as seizures, development delay, or intellectual disability. PGM1-CDG is caused by genetic changes in the PGM1 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. The diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms and specific blood test results, and it is confirmed with genetic testing. The course of the disorder and whether symptoms or complications may affect the lifespan are difficult to predict and vary among people with PGM1-CDG."
"Summary of PGM3-CDG: IMD23 is an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by recurrent respiratory and skin infections beginning in early childhood. Laboratory studies are notable for increased serum IgE. Affected individuals also show developmental delay or cognitive impairment of varying severity (summary by Zhang et al., 2014)."
Summary of Phosphomannoisomerase deficiency: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity: Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity is a rare genetic disorder that affects how the body processes purines. Purines are substances that are found in many foods and are also made by the body. The disorder is caused by problems with an enzyme called phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRS1). Changes in the PRS1 gene can cause the enzyme to be overactive, underactive or unstable, which can lead to problems with purine metabolism. The condition is more common in males. There are two forms of the disorder. An early-onset severe form is characterized by gout, which is a type of arthritis caused by a buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints. This form can also cause urolithiasis, which is the formation of kidney stones, and neurodevelopmental anomalies, which are problems with the development of the nervous system. A mild late-onset form does not involve the nervous system and is less severe than the early-onset form. It can cause hyperuricemia, which is a high level of uric acid in the blood, and hyperuricosuria, which is a high level of uric acid in the urine."
"Summary of Piebaldism: Piebaldism is a rare inherited condition characterized by a white forelock (a patch of white hair directly above the forehead). The name Piebaldism is derived from the words âpieâ (from magpie, which is a black and white bird) and âbaldâ (from the bald eagle, the US national bird that has a white feathered head). Other features include a white patch on the central portion of the forehead; white eyebrow and eyelash hair; and white patches of skin on the face (particularly the chin), trunk and extremities (hands and feet are not usually affected). This condition is present at birth and usually remains unchanged throughout life. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is caused by genetic changes in the KIT gene."
Summary of Piepkorn Karp Hickok syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: Although the signs and symptoms vary depending on the specific type, the most common symptom of ADCA is poor movement coordination (ataxia) especially a jerky, unsteady walking style (gait). Coordination of hands and clearness of speech (dysarthria) are also affected. The area of the brain controlling balance and movement decreases in size (cerebellar atrophy). This can be seen on brain imaging. ADCAs include the autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), all of the episodic ataxias (EAs) and the one dominant type of spastic ataxia (SPAX1). Genetic changes or changes in many different genes are known to cause many of the different types of ADCA, but more genes are still being discovered. Inheritance is autosomal dominant . Diagnosis of ADCA is based on clinical history, physical examination, genetic testing, and ruling out other diseases."
"Summary of Isolated Pierre Robin syndrome: Pierre Robin sequence is a condition present at birth, in which the infant has a smaller than normal lower jaw (micrognathia), a tongue that is placed further back than normal (glossoptosis), and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). This combination of features can lead to difficulty breathing and problems with eating early in life. Pierre Robin sequence may occur alone (isolated) or be associated with a variety of other signs and symptoms (described as syndromic). In about 20 to 40 percent of cases, the condition occurs alone. The exact causes of Pierre Robin syndrome are unknown. Changes in the DNA near the SOX9 gene are the most common genetic cause of isolated cases of Pierre Robin sequence."

Summary of Pierre Robin syndrome skeletal dysplasia polydactyly: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pigment-dispersion syndrome: Pigment-dispersion syndrome is an eye disorder that occurs when pigment granules that normally adhere to the back of the iris (the colored part of the eye) flake off into the clear fluid produced by the eye (aqueous humor). These pigment granules may flow towards the drainage canals of the eye, slowly clogging them and raising the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure or IOP). This rise in eye pressure can cause damage to the optic nerve (the nerve in the back of the eye that carries visual images to the brain). If the optic nerve becomes damaged, Pigment-dispersion syndrome becomes pigmentary glaucoma. This happens in about 30% of cases. While men and women are affected in equal numbers, men develop pigmentary glaucoma up to 3 times more often than women. Myopia (nearsightedness) appears to be an important risk factor in the development of Pigment-dispersion syndrome and is present in up to 80% of affected individuals. The condition may be sporadic or follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with reduced penetrance . At least one gene locus on chromosome 7 has been identified."
"Summary of Late-onset retinal degeneration: Late-onset retinal degeneration is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by delayed dark adaptation and nyctalopia and drusen deposits presenting in adulthood, followed by cone and rod degeneration that presents in the sixth decade of life, which leads to central vision loss. Anterior segment features such as peripupillary iris transillumination defects and abnormally long anterior zonular insertions are also observed. Choroidal neovascularization and glaucoma may occur in the late stages of the disease."
"Summary of Severe combined immunodeficiency due to FOXN1 deficiency: A rare, genetic, primary immunodeficiency due to a defect in adaptive immunity characterized by the triad of congenital athymia (resulting in severe T-cell immunodeficiency), congenital alopecia totalis and nail dystrophy. Patients present neonatal or infantile-onset, severe, recurrent, life-threatening infections and low or absent circulating T cells. Additional features reported include erythroderma, lymphoadenopathy, diarrhea and failure to thrive."
"Summary of Ringed hair disease: Ringed hair disease is a hair disorder. In Ringed hair disease, affected hair has a pattern of light and dark banding. People with Ringed hair disease may describe their hair as """"striped"""" or as having silvery beads. Ringed hair disease typically involves 20-80% of scalp hair, however it can involve facial and body hair as well. Affected hairs may be more prone to breakage. It can be seen with the naked eye, however it may be more difficult to see in people with dark hair. Diagnosis is confirmed by polariscopic and/or electron microscopic examination of affected hairs. The condition runs in an autosomal dominant fashion in some families. Reduced penetrance and variable expression has been described. Sporadic cases have also been reported."
"Summary of Pili torti: Pili torti is a rare hair condition characterized by fragile hair. In Pili torti hair has a flattened shaft with clusters of narrow twists at irregular intervals. Some cases may be inherited in autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive patterns, while others are acquired. In the inherited form, symptoms tend to be present from early childhood. It can occur alone or as part of other diseases like ectodermal dysplasias, Menke disease, Bjornstand syndrome, or Bazex syndrome. If Pili torti is detected, it is necessary to investigate possible neurological disorders, hearing loss, and defects in the hair, nails, sweat glands and teeth."
"Summary of Pili torti-developmental delay-neurological abnormalities syndrome: Pili torti-developmental delay-neurological abnormalities syndrome is characterized by growth and developmental delay, mild to moderate neurologic abnormalities, and pili torti.

Mild palmoplantar keratosis, cafÃ©-au-lait spots on back, mild dystrophy of nails, and tibial deflection of toes are also associated. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1986."
Summary of Refsum disease with increased pipecolic acidemia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome: Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a genetic syndrome that causes developmental delays, moderate to severe intellectual disability, behavioral differences, distinctive facial features, and breathing problems such as episodes of rapid breathing (hyperventilation) and breath-holding. Other features may include symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, sleep disturbances, seizures, constipation, nearsightedness, and minor skeletal abnormalities. PTHS is caused by a genetic change in the TCF4 gene, or by a loss (deletion) of the part of chromosome 18 that contains the TCF4 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, but PTHS typically is not inherited from a parent, occurring sporadically due to a new genetic change in people with no family history of PTHS. The diagnosis may be suspected based on signs and symptoms and can be confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Thumb stiffness-brachydactyly-intellectual disability syndrome: A rare, genetic, congenital limb malformation syndrome characterized by bilateral thumb ankylosis, type A brachydactyly and mild to moderate intellectual disability. Patients present thumb stiffness and abnormalities of the metacarpal bones, frequently associated with mild facial dysmorphism and signs of obesity.

"Summary of Hypoplasminogenemia: Hypoplasminogenemia deficiency is a genetic condition associated with inflammed growths on the mucous membranes, the moist tissues that line body openings such as the eye, mouth, nasopharynx, trachea, and female genital tract. The growths may be triggered by local injury and/or infection and often recur after removal. The growths are caused by the deposition of fibrin (a protein involved in blood clotting) and by inflammation. The most common clinical finding is ligneous ('wood-like') conjunctivitis, a condition marked by redness and subsequent formation of pseudomembranes of part of the eye that progresses to white, yellow-white or red thick masses with a wood-like consistency that replace the normal mucosa. This can lead to vision loss. Growths in other areas can also lead to medical problems; those that occur in the gastrointestinal tract can cause ulcers, and growth in the windpipe can lead to breathing problems. Hydrocephalus may be present at birth in a small number of individuals. Type 1 plasminogen deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the PLG gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Congenital plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 deficiency: Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI1) deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder that causes excessive or prolonged bleeding due to blood clots being broken down too early. PAI1 is a protein in the body needed for normal blood clotting. When the body does not have enough functional PAI1, the body's ability keep blood clots intact is impaired. Some people with PAI1 deficiency have some functional PAI1 (partial PAI1 deficiency), while others do not have any (complete PAI1 deficiency). Therefore, the severity of symptoms depends on how much functional PAI1 a person has. People with complete PAI1 deficiency may have symptoms in infancy, while those with partial PAI1 deficiency may not have symptoms until later in life, after an injury or surgery. Symptoms of PAI1 deficiency include excessive or prolonged bleeding after an injury, or after a medical or dental procedure. The bleeding may be delayed if clots initially form but are broken down too early. Internal bleeding after an injury can be serious, particularly if it occurs around the brain. Other symptoms may include delayed wound healing, nosebleeds that last a long time, easy bruising, bleeding in the joints, and excessive bleeding in females during menstruation, pregnancy or childbirth. Some people with PAI1 deficiency may have scar tissue in the heart (cardiac fibrosis). PAI1 deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the SERPINE1 gene and inheritance typically is autosomal recessive. The specific genetic changes present determine whether a person has complete or partial PAI1 deficiency. In rare cases partial PAI1 deficiency has appeared to be autosomal dominant, but the genetic causes in these cases were not determined. In general, people with one SERPINE1 genetic change (carriers) will not develop significant symptoms, if any. A diagnosis of PAI1 deficiency may be made based on evaluation of symptoms, various blood tests, and genetic testing of the SERPINE1 gene."
"Summary of Platyspondylic dysplasia, Torrance type: Platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia (PLSD), Torrance type (PLSD-T) is a skeletal dysplasia characterised by severe limb shortening (short and broad long bones), platyspondyly with wafer-like vertebral bodies, short ribs with anterior cupping, severe hypoplasia of the lower ilia and radial bowing. Histological findings include slightly enlarged chondrocytes and hypercellularity. The prevalence is unknown. The disorder is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait and is caused by mutations in the C-propeptide domain of the COL2A1 gene. Although PLSD-T is generally lethal, survival to adulthood has been reported in two families."
"Summary of Pneumocystosis: Human pneumocystosis is caused by an infectious agent, which (after recent nomenclature and taxonomy revisions) is now classed as the fungus Pneumocystis jiroveci. The prevalence is unknown. Pneumocystis jiroveci is an opportunistic infectious agent, developing in immunosuppressed patients. It is an air-borne infection, localised to the lungs. However, extrapulmonary involvement is seen in AIDS patients. The disease manifests progressively with coughing, respiratory problems (dyspnea) and fever, followed by acute respiratory insufficiency and death within a few weeks in untreated cases. The most reliable diagnostic method is bronchoalveolar lavage. The treatment of choice is cotrimoxazole."
Summary of Podder-Tolmie syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Kindler epidermolysis bullosa: Kindler epidermolysis bullosa is a rare type of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of inherited conditions that cause fragile and blistering skin.

Summary of Aminolevulinate dehydratase deficiency porphyria: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Congenital erythropoietic porphyria: Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is the rarest type of porphyria and is commonly seen in infancy. It is characterized by severe skin photosensitivity that may lead to scarring, blistering, and increased hair growth at the face and back of the hands. Photosensitivity and infection may cause the loss of fingers and facial features. Symptoms of CEP range from mild to severe and may include excessive hair growth throughout the body (hypertrichosis), reddish discoloration of the teeth, anemia, and reddish-colored urine. In CEP, there is a defect in the synthesis of heme within the red blood cells of bone marrow. This defect leads to an increase in the buildup and, therefore, waste of porphyrin and its precursors, which leads to the signs and symptoms. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. It is caused by genetic changes in the UROS gene."
Summary of Positive rheumatoid factor polyarthritis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Postpoliomyelitis syndrome: Symptoms and severity vary among affected people and may include muscle weakness and a gradual decrease in the size of muscles (atrophy); muscle and joint pain; fatigue; difficulty with gait; respiratory problems; and/or swallowing problems.

Summary of Posterior uveitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Potassium-aggravated myotonia: Potassium aggravated myotonia is a group of diseases that causes tensing and stiffness (myotonia) of skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. The three types of potassium-aggravated myotonia include myotonia fluctuans, myotonia permanens, and acetazolamide-sensitive myotonia. Potassium aggravated myotonia is different from other types of myotonia because symptoms get worse when an affected individual eats food that is rich in potassium. Symptoms usually develop during childhood and vary, ranging from infrequent mild episodes to long periods of severe disease. Potassium aggravated myotonia is an inherited condition that is caused by changes in the SCN4A gene."
"Summary of Potter sequence: Potter sequence refers to a group of features that can result when there is too little amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) surrounding a baby while in the uterus. This can cause distinct facial features (Potter facies), which may include a flattened nose, recessed chin, skin folds covering the corners of the eyes (epicanthal folds), and low-set abnormal ears. Having low amniotic fluid can also result in underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia). Other associated features may include eye malformations and heart defects. There are various causes of Potter sequence including failure of the kidneys to develop (bilateral renal agenesis), polycystic kidney diseases, prune belly syndrome, rupture of membranes surrounding the baby, and other kidney abnormalities. The underlying cause of the sequence is often undetermined, but it may be genetic in some cases. The inheritance pattern depends on the specific genetic cause. Diagnosis is based on ultrasound findings or the presence of characteristic symptoms such as kidney malfunction and difficulty breathing."

"Summary of Precocious puberty, gonadotropin-dependent: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Familial male-limited precocious puberty: Familial male-limited precocious puberty is a form of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in which boys experience early onset and progression of puberty. Patients have accelerated growth, early development of secondary sexual characteristics and reduced adult height. Familial male-limited precocious puberty is caused by an activating genetic change of the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHCGR) gene, which leads to increased levels of sex steroids in the context of low luteinizing hormone. The condition may be sporadic or transmitted as a dominant trait. It is only expressed in males."
"Summary of Congenital prekallikrein deficiency: A rare genetic coagulation disorder characterized by the usually incidental laboratory finding of a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) but normal prothrombin time, due to a deficiency of normal prekallikrein or the presence of nonfunctional prekallikrein.

"Summary of Griscelli syndrome type 2: Griscelli syndrome type 2 (GS2) is a rare, inherited condition that affects the skin, hair, and immune system. People with GS2 have unusually light skin and silver-colored hair. They are also prone to recurrent infections and develop an immune condition called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH can damage organs and tissues throughout the body, causing complications. GS2 is caused by changes in the RAB27A gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Primary ciliary dyskinesia: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder which affects the movement of tiny hair-like structures on body cells, known as cilia. Cilia are present on many types of cells, and particularly on those in the respiratory tract. In PCD, the cilia are abnormal, and don't move correctly. People with this disorder cannot clear the mucous and fluid in their lungs and airways. This leads to frequent respiratory infections, and continuous nasal congestion and coughing. In addition, because cilia are involved in how the organs form and develop, many people with PCD may have abnormal placement of the organs in the body, known as situs abnormalities. For example, their heart may be on the right side of their chest instead of the left. Almost all males with PCD are infertile. PCD is caused by genetic changes in one of over 30 different genes involved in the formation of cilia, and is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern in families. It is diagnosed based on the clinical symptoms. Other diagnostic tests may include ciliary analysis and genetic testing."
"Summary of Juvenile primary lateral sclerosis: Juvenile primary lateral sclerosis is a rare disorder characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness of muscles in the arms, legs, and face.

"Summary of Progressive external ophthalmoplegia: Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) is a condition characterized mainly by a loss of the muscle functions involved in eye and eyelid movement. Signs and symptoms tend to begin in early adulthood and most commonly include weakness or paralysis of the muscles that move the eye (ophthalmoplegia) and drooping of the eyelids (ptosis). Some affected individuals also have general weakness of the skeletal muscles (myopathy), which may be especially noticeable during exercise. Muscle weakness may also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). CPEO can be caused by genetic changes in any of several genes, which may be located in mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA. It has different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved in the affected individual. CPEO can occur as part of other underlying conditions, such as ataxia neuropathy spectrum and Kearns-Sayre syndrome. These conditions may not only involve CPEO, but various additional features that are not shared by most individuals with CPEO."
"Summary of Deafness, x-linked 2: Deafness, x-linked 2 (DFNX2), also known as DFN3, is a genetic disorder that affects hearing. It is caused by changes in the POU3F4 gene. It follows an x-linked pattern of inheritance. In some cases, the disorder is caused by deletions, inversions, or duplications in a specific region of the X chromosome. DFNX2 causes a gradual loss of hearing and a specific bone deformity in the ear. This bone deformity can cause a fluid leak during the surgery used to fix hearing loss (stapes surgery)."
"Summary of Progressive kinking of the hair, acquired: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Atypical progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome: Atypical progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disease. It affects the brain and symptoms begin late in life. It is a form of progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSP), but it does not follow the usual pattern of PSP. Atypical PSP can cause problems with movement, speech, and thinking. There are different types of atypical PSP, including: PSP with predominant Parkinsonism (PSP-P), PSP with progressive gait freezing (PSP-PGF), PSP with predominant corticobasal syndrome (PSP-CBS), PSP with predominant speech/language disorder (PSP-SL), PSP with predominant frontal presentation (PSP-F), PSP with predominant ocular motor dysfunction (PSP-OM), and PSP with predominant postural instability (PSP-PI)."
"Summary of Prolactinoma: Prolactinoma is a tumor of the pituitary gland that causes increased levels of the hormone prolactin. This hormone normally stimulates breast development and milk production in women. Prolactinoma can affect men or women. In women, the symptoms may include unusual milk production (galactorrhea) when not pregnant or nursing and having no menstrual cycles (amenorrhea). In men, the most common symptoms are decreased sex drive and infertility. Most Prolactinomas occur by chance (sporadically) in people with no family history. In a small number of cases, Prolactinoma may be caused by a genetic condition such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or familial isolated pituitary adenoma."
"Summary of Proliferating trichilemmal cyst: Proliferating trichilemmal tumor (PTT) is a benign tumor originating from the hair follicle. Although it is a benign tumor, PTT may be locally aggressive and in very rare cases the tumor may become malignant. In most cases there is only one lesion and occur in elderly women. The tumor is not painful but sometimes they may grow very large and pressure and damage the skin around it resulting in wounds and foul-smelling discharge. About 90% of the cases are on the scalp, but they have also been found on the forehead, nose, back, chest, abdomen, buttocks, elbow, wrist and genitalia."
"Summary of Properdin deficiency: Properdin deficiency is a rare, hereditary, primary immunodeficiency due to a complement cascade protein anomaly characterized by significantly increased susceptibility to Neisseria species infections. It only affects males, typically presenting with severe or fulminant meningococcal disease."
"Summary of Familial prostate cancer: Familial prostate cancer is a cluster of prostate cancer within a family. Most cases of prostate cancer occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. However, approximately 5% to 10% of prostate cancer cases are believed to be primarily caused by a genetic predisposition to the condition. In many families, the underlying genetic cause is unknown; however, some of these cases are caused by changes in the BRCA1, BRCA2, HOXB13, or several other genes. Other cases are likely due to a combination of gene(s) and other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle. High-risk cancer screening at an earlier age is typically recommended in men who have an increased risk for prostate cancer based on personal and/or family histories."
Summary of Protein C deficiency: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Protein S deficiency: Protein S deficiency is a disorder that causes abnormal blood clotting. When someone bleeds, the blood begins a complicated series of rapid chemical reactions involving proteins called blood coagulation factors to stop the bleeding. Other proteins in the blood, such as protein S, usually regulate these chemical reactions to prevent excessive clotting. When protein S is missing (deficient), clotting may not be regulated normally and affected individuals have an increased risk of forming a blood clot called a thrombosis. People at risk to have Protein S deficiency are those with an individual or family history of multiple blood clots in the veins."
"Summary of Autosomal erythropoietic protoporphyria: Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a type of porphyria. Porphyrias are caused by an abnormality in the heme production process. Heme is essential in enabling our blood cells to carry oxygen and in breaking down chemical compounds in the liver. Erythropoietic protoporphyria is caused by pathogenic variants in the FECH gene which lead to an impaired activity of ferrocheletase (FECH), an important enzyme in heme production. This results in the build-up of protoporphyrin in the bone marrow, red blood cells, blood plasma, skin, and eventually liver. Build up of protoporphyrin can cause extreme sensitivity to sunlight, liver damage, abdominal pain, gallstones, and enlargement of the spleen. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Corpus callosum agenesis-abnormal genitalia syndrome: Corpus callosum agenesis-abnormal genitalia syndrome is a rare neurological condition that is primarily characterized by severe intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum, seizures, and spasticity. It usually occurs in males; when it occurs in females, the signs and symptoms are often less severe. Corpus callosum agenesis-abnormal genitalia syndrome is caused by changes in the ARX gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner."

(Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, p984)"
"Summary of Pseudopelade of Brocq: Pseudopelade of Brocq (PBB) is a slowly progressive, chronic condition characterized by scarring hair loss (cicatricial alopecia). PBB is classified into two categories depending on whether a scarring alopecia is present (burnt-out or end-stage scarring) or not (idiopathic). The patches of hair loss present in PBB may be single or multiple. They are usually small, discrete, round or oval, and asymmetrical. The underlying skin is typically smooth, soft, and flesh-colored or white, with little, if any, inflammation. Although the exact cause of PBB has not been identified, it is believed to be an autoimmune disease. Other factors that may be involved include infections with Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease and issues with the cells involved in hair growth (stem cell failure)."
Summary of Pseudo-Turner syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Bifunctional enzyme deficiency: Bifunctional enzyme deficiency, also known as D-bifunctional protein deficiency (DBP deficiency), is a genetic disorder that affects the ability of the body to effectively break down fat from our diet. It is typically characterized by hypotonia (low muscle tone) and seizures in the newborn period. Other symptoms include unusual facial features and an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly). Bifunctional enzyme deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the HSD17B4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Pseudoachondroplasia: Pseudoachondroplasia is an inherited disorder of bone growth which is characterized by short stature. Other features include short arms and legs, a waddling walk, early-onset joint pain (osteoarthritis), and a limited range of motion at the elbows and hips.

Craniofacial peculiarities (coarse features, deep set eyes), spina bifida, imperforate anus, and sensorineural hearing loss were also described. No new cases have been reported since 1994."
"Summary of Generalized pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1: Generalized pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is a disorder of electrolyte metabolism characterized by excess loss of salt in the urine and high concentrations of sodium in sweat, stool, and saliva. The disorder involves multiple organ systems and is especially dangerous in the newborn period. Laboratory tests may show hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and increased plasma renin activity with high levels of aldosterone in the blood. Respiratory tract infections are common in affected children. Generalized pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by genetic changes in the genes coding for the subunits of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (SCNN1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G)."
"Summary of Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2: Psuedohypoaldosteronism type 2 is an inborn error of metabolism. It is characterized by high blood pressure, high levels of potassium in the body, and metabolic acidosis. It is caused by genetic changes in the WNK1 or WNK4 gene."
"Summary of Acrootoocular syndrome: A very rare disorder associating pseudopapilledema (optic disc swelling not secondary to increased intracranial pressure), mixed hearing loss, facial dysmorphism and limb extremity anomalies."
"Summary of Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), formerly known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a condition that affects the brain. Pseudotumor cerebri literally translates to ""false brain tumor."" This term was used because symptoms of IIH resemble those of brain tumors depsite no tumor being present. Symptoms of IIH may include severe headache, nausea and vomiting, altered vision, and pulsating sounds within the head. A person with IIH may also have symptoms such as a stiff neck, back or arm pain, eye pain, and memory problems. While the exact underlying cause of IIH is not known (idiopathic), it is likely due to high fluid pressure within the skull that is due to buildup, or poor absorption, of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). IIH most often (but not always) occurs in young, overweight, females. When symptoms of intracranial pressure have an identifiable cause such as another underlying disease or medication, the condition is instead referred to as secondary IH."
"Summary of Familial pterygium of the conjunctiva: Pterygium of the conjunctiva and cornea is a benign (non-cancerous) pink lesion that grows from the conjunctiva onto the cornea.

"Summary of Hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: Hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare form of respiratory failure that is present from birth. In this condition, a substance made up of fat and protein (surfactant) builds up in the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs, making breathing difficult. Hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is caused by genetic changes in one of several different genes. It is inherited in either an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive pattern depending on the gene involved. If the gene involved is the ABCA3 gene, the CSF2RB gene, or the SFTPB gene, inheritance is autosomal recessive. If the gene involved is the SFTPC gene, inheritance is autosomal dominant. If the gene involved is the CSF2RA gene, inheritance is X-linked recessive. Hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is diagnosed based on the symptoms, imaging studies and genetic testing."

"Summary of Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency: Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency is a disorder of the immune system (primary immunodeficiency) characterized by recurrent infections, neurologic symptoms, and autoimmune disorders. PNP deficiency causes a shortage of white blood cells, called T-cells, that help fight infection. Some people with this condition develop neurologic symptoms, such as stiff or rigid muscles (spasticity), uncoordinated movements (ataxia), developmental delay, and intellectual disability. In addition, PNP deficiency is associated with an increased risk to develop autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune neutropenia, thyroiditis, and lupus.

TTP causes blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels throughout the body. These clots can cause medical problems if they block vessels and decrease or stop blood flow to organs such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. Complications may include neurological problems (such as personality changes, headaches, confusion, and slurred speech), fever, abnormal kidney function, abdominal pain, and heart problems. Hemolytic anemia can lead to paleness, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. Acquired TTP usually begins in adulthood, but can affect children. An episode of TTP usually occurs suddenly and lasts for days or weeks, but it may continue for months. Relapses (or flareups) can occur in up to 60 percent of people who have the acquired TTP. Acquired TTP is caused when a person's body mistakingly makes antibodies that block the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme. THe ADAMTS13 enzyme normally helps control the activity of certain blood clotting factors."

"Summary of Infantile Refsum disease: Infantile Refsum disease is the mildest of a group of disorders known as peroxisome biogenesis disorders, Zellweger syndrome spectrum (PBD-ZSS). PBD-ZSS is a group of inherited genetic disorders that damage the white matter of the brain and affect motor movements. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders, in turn, are part of a larger group of disorders called leukodystrophies. IRD can cause low muscle tone (hypotonia), retinitis pigmentosa (a visual impairment that can lead to blindness), developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss, and liver dysfunction. IRD usually presents at birth or in infancy. Most individuals with IRD can achieve motor milestones, though they may be delayed, and most individuals can communicate with a few words or signs. Leukodystrophy with loss of acquired skills can occur at any age and may stabilize or progress. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders are caused by genetic changes in one of the PEX genes and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

Additional features of rhythmic shaking (static tremor) in the hands and an unsteady gait (gait ataxia) are specific to Roussy Levy syndrome. This disorder is caused by issues with nerve conduction and sensory dysfunction. Roussy Levy syndrome may result from a duplication of the PMP22 gene (which is also associated with CMT1A) or a genetic change in the myelin protein zero (MPZ) gene (genetic changes in this gene are also associated with CMT1B). Roussy Levy syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."

"Summary of Congenital rubella syndrome: Congenital rubella refers to the group of birth defects that occur in an infant whose mother is infected with the virus that causes German measles (rubella) during pregnancy. Congenital rubella occurs when the rubella virus in the mother affects the developing baby in the first 3 months of pregnancy. After the fourth month, if the mother has a rubella infection, it is less likely to harm the developing baby. The most common problems are hearing loss due to damage to the nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain (sensorineural hearing loss), ocular abnormalities (cataract, infantile glaucoma, and pigmentary retinopathy) and heart problems. Other symptoms and signs may include intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, stillbirth, miscarriage, neurological problems (intellectual disability, low muscle tone, very small head), liver and spleen enlargement (hepatosplenomegaly), jaundice, skin problems, anemia, hormonal problems, and other issues. The number of babies born with Congenital rubella is much less since the rubella vaccine was developed. Pregnant women who are not vaccinated for rubella and who have not had the disease in the past risk infecting themselves and their unborn baby."

"Summary of Benign schwannoma: Benign schwannoma is a tumor of the peripheral nervous system or nerve root. A Benign schwannoma develops from cells called Schwann cells, a type of cell that wraps itself around peripheral nerves and provides protection and support. Benign schwannomas are almost always benign (not cancerous), but rarely, may become cancerous (a malignant Schwannoma). Symptoms of a Benign schwannoma may be vague and will vary depending on its location and size, but may include a lump or bump that can be seen or felt, pain, muscle weakness, tingling, numbness, hearing problems, and/or facial paralysis. Sometimes Benign schwannomas do not cause any symptoms. Benign schwannomas usually develop in otherwise healthy people for unknown reasons. In some cases, a Benign schwannoma is caused by a genetic disorder such as neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), Schwannomatosis, or Carney complex. People with these genetic disorders usually have more than one Benign schwannoma. Benign schwannomas may be diagnosed using imaging studies. A biopsy may confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Schwannomatosis: Schwannomatosis is a rare form of neurofibromatosis that is primarily characterized by multiple schwannomas (benign tumors of the nervous system) in the absence of bilateral (affecting both sides) vestibular schwannomas. Signs and symptoms of the condition vary based on the size, location and number of schwannomas but may include pain; numbness; tingling; and/or weakness in the fingers and toes. Inherited forms of the disorder account for only 15 percent of all cases. In some of these families, Schwannomatosis is caused by changes in the SMARCB1 or LZTR1 genes; in other cases, the exact underlying cause is unknown. When inherited, the condition is passed down in an autosomal dominant manner with highly variable expressivity and reduced penetrance."
"Summary of Congenital muscular dystrophy, Ullrich type: Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy is a condition that mainly affects skeletal muscles (the muscles used for movement). Affected individuals show severe muscle weakness soon after birth, develop stiff joints (contractures) in their knees and elbows, and may have an unusual range of movement (hypermobility) in their wrists and ankles. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 genes. Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In rare cases, this condition may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
"Summary of Sclerosteosis: Sclerosteosis is a very rare serious sclerosing hyperostosis syndrome characterized clinically by variable syndactyly and progressive skeletal overgrowth (particularly of the skull), resulting in distinctive facial features (mandibular overgrowth, frontal bossing, midfacial hypoplasia), cranial nerve entrapment causing facial palsy and deafness, and potentially lethal elevation of intracranial pressure."
"Summary of Succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase deficiency: Succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase deficiency (SCOT deficiency) is a metabolic disease that is caused by reduced or missing levels of an enzyme called succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT). This enzyme is necessary for the body to use ketones. Ketones are substances produced in the liver when fats are broken down. Ketones are an important source of energy, especially when there is a shortage of carbohydrates (sugar). SCOT deficiency is characterized by episodes of ketoacidosis (build-up of ketones in the body). Symptoms of ketoacidosis may vary but can include trouble breathing, poor feeding, vomiting, and lethargy. In some cases, the symptoms can progress to include loss of consciousness and a coma. In between these episodes, individuals with SCOT deficiency do not have any symptoms. SCOT deficiency is caused by genetic changes (changes) in the OXCT1 gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. SCOT deficiency can be diagnosed by ruling out other causes of ketoacidosis and measuring the level of SCOT enzyme. Genetic testing of the OXCT1 gene can be used to confirm the diagnosis."

"Summary of Shigellosis: Shigellosis is a disease caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella. Shigella is very contagious. Shigella germs are present in the stools of infected individuals for up to two weeks after symptoms have resolved. Individuals may be exposed through direct contact with an infected person or through contaminated food, water (both drinking and recreational water), or surfaces. Though anyone can get Shigellosis, young children are most at risk. Symptoms of Shigellosis usually begin one to two days after exposure and include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. In otherwise healthy individuals, the symptoms usually resolve in 5-7 days. Most people make a full recovery, though it may take several months for bowel habits to return to normal. Complications are rare but may include post-infectious arthritis, bloodstream infections, seizures, or hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS)."
"Summary of Short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency is a rare genetic condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats (called short-chain fatty acids) into energy. This condition belongs to a group of disorders known as fatty acid oxidation disorders (FOD). SCAD deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the ACADS gene. These genetic changes lead to a shortage (deficiency) of an enzyme known as short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is involved in the breakdown of short-chain fatty acids. When not enough of this enzyme is present, excessive amounts of fatty acids and ammonia accumulate in the body. The symptoms of SCAD deficiency include a lack of energy, poor growth, and developmental delay."

IAHSP is caused by genetic changes in the ALS2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Spastic paraplegia-epilepsy-intellectual disability syndrome: GLUT1 deficiency syndrome is a disorder affecting the nervous system that can have a variety of neurological signs and symptoms. Approximately 90 percent of affected individuals have a form of the disorder often referred to as common GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. These individuals generally have frequent seizures (epilepsy) beginning in the first months of life. In newborns, the first sign of the disorder may be involuntary eye movements that are rapid and irregular. Babies with common GLUT1 deficiency syndrome have a normal head size at birth, but growth of the brain and skull is often slow, which can result in an abnormally small head size (microcephaly). People with this form of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome may have developmental delay or intellectual disability. Most affected individuals also have other neurological problems, such as stiffness caused by abnormal tensing of the muscles (spasticity), difficulty in coordinating movements (ataxia), and speech difficulties (dysarthria). Some experience episodes of confusion, lack of energy (lethargy), headaches, or muscle twitches (myoclonus), particularly during periods without food (fasting).About 10 percent of individuals with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome have a form of the disorder often known as non-epileptic GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, which is usually less severe than the common form. People with the non-epileptic form do not have seizures, but they may still have developmental delay and intellectual disability. Most have movement problems such as ataxia or involuntary tensing of various muscles (dystonia); the movement problems may be more pronounced than in the common form.Several conditions that were originally given other names have since been recognized to be variants of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. These include paroxysmal choreoathetosis with spasticity (dystonia 9); paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia and epilepsy (dystonia 18); and certain types of epilepsy. In rare cases, people with variants of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome produce abnormal red blood cells and have uncommon forms of a blood condition known as anemia, which is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells."

"Summary of Familial spontaneous pneumothorax: Familial spontaneous pneumothorax (Primary spontaneous pneumothorax) is an abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space (the space between the lungs and the chest cavity) that can result in the partial or complete collapse of a lung. It occurs in the absence of lung disease such as emphysema and spontaneous because the pneumothorax was not caused by an injury such as a rib fracture. Familial spontaneous pneumothorax is likely caused by the formation of small sacs of air (blebs) in lung tissue that rupture, causing air to leak into the pleural space. This air creates pressure on the lung and can lead to its collapse. Symptoms may include chest pain on the side of the collapsed lung and shortness of breath. The blebs that lead to Familial spontaneous pneumothorax may be present in an individual's lung (or lungs) for a long time before they rupture. A change in air pressure or a very sudden deep breath may cause a rupture to occur. In most cases, there are no prior signs of illness. In rare cases, the condition can be caused by genetic changes in the FLCN gene. In these cases, the condition follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."

"Summary of Stiff person spectrum disorder: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare, progressive syndrome that affects the nervous system, specifically the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms may include extreme muscle stiffness, rigidity and painful spasms in the trunk and limbs, severely impairing mobility. Spasms can generate enough force to fracture bone. People with SPS often have heightened sensitivity to noise, sudden movements, and emotional distress, which can set off muscle spasms. Persistent symptoms can lead to abnormal posturing of the spine, such as being hunched over. The syndrome affects twice as many women as men. SPS is caused by increased muscle activity due to decreased inhibition of the central nervous system. It is thought to have an autoimmune component and is often associated with diabetes, as well as other autoimmune diseases such as thyroiditis, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia. It may be diagnosed after having various tests including blood tests (such as for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies which is elevated in about 2 in 3 people with SPS), a lumbar puncture, and electromyography."

Protruding ears, prominent coccyx bone (or tail bone), and congenital heart defects are also frequently present. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the SH3PXD2B gene and is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Embryonal carcinoma: Embryonal carcinoma is a type of testicular cancer, which is cancer that starts in the testicles, the male reproductive glands located in the scrotum. It most often develops in young and middle-aged men. It tends to grow rapidly and spread outside the testicle. Embryonal carcinomas are classified as nonseminoma germ cell tumors. Most testicular cancers grow from germ cells, the cells that make sperm. Germ cell tumors are broadly divided into seminomas and nonseminomas because each type has a different prognosis and treatment regimen. Nonseminomas, which are more common, tend to grow more quickly than seminomas. Nonseminoma tumors are often made up of more than one type of cell, and are identified according to the different cell types."
"Summary of Tetanus: A toxin-mediated infection due to the anaerobic bacteria Clostridium tetani and characterized by spasms and contractions of the skeletal muscles, the disease is often lethal."
Summary of Tetraamelia with pulmonary hypoplasia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Tetra-amelia: Tetra-amelia syndrome is a characterized by the absence of all four limbs. This syndrome can also cause severe malformations of other parts of the body, including the face and head, heart, nervous system, skeleton, and genitalia. The lungs are underdeveloped in many cases, which makes breathing difficult or impossible. The condition has been associated with a genetic change in the WNT3 gene in one family, and it appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Tetraploidy: Tetraploidy is an extremely rare chromosomal anomaly, polyploidy, when an affected individual has four copies of each chromosome, instead of two, resulting in total of 92 chromosomes in each cell. The phenotype is severe with multiple congenital anomalies, including central nervous system, ocular, cardiac, renal, and/or genital malformations and limb defects. Most patients show severe intrauterine growth retardation, hypotonia, failure to thrive and developmental delay. It is usually associated with miscarriage."
"Summary of Inverted duplicated chromosome 15 syndrome: Inverted duplicated chromosome 15 syndrome is a chromosome abnormality that affects many different parts of the body. As the name suggests, people with this condition have an extra chromosome (called an isodicentric chromosome 15) which is made of two pieces of chromosome 15 that are stuck together end-to-end. Although the severity of the condition and the associated features vary from person to person, common signs and symptoms include poor muscle tone in newborns; developmental delay; mild to severe intellectual disability; delayed or absent speech; behavioral abnormalities; and seizures. Most cases of Inverted duplicated chromosome 15 syndrome occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Thakker-Donnai syndrome: Thakker-Donnai syndrome is a rare, genetic, lethal, multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized by facial dysmorphism (including long, downward slanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, posteriorly rotated ears, broad nasal bridge, short nose with a bulbous tip and anteverted nares, downturned corners of the mouth) as well as vertebral (occult spina bifida, hemivertebrae), brain (ventricular dilatation, agenesis of corpus callosum), cardiac (tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect) and gastrointestinal (short esophagus with intrathoracic stomach, small intestine, spleen and pancreas, anal atresia) malformations. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1991."
Summary of Central pain syndrome: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Theodor Hertz Goodman syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Coccygodynia: Coccygodynia is a rare condition in that causes pain in and around the coccyx (tailbone). Although various causes have been described for the condition, the more common causes are direct falls and injury."
"Summary of Progressive deafness with stapes fixation: Progressive deafness with stapes fixation, also known as Thies Reis syndrome, is a form of conductive or mixed hearing loss caused by fixation of the stapes. The stapes is one of the tiny bones in the middle ear. It rests in the entrance to the inner ear, allowing sounds to pass to the inner ear. If it becomes fixated, sound waves cannot pass through to the inner ear, resulting in loss of hearing. This condition may be associated with a number of conditions, including otosclerosis, Paget's disease and osteogenesis imperfecta, or it may be found in isolation. It may also result from chronic ear infections (otitis media with tympanosclerosis)."
"Summary of Thiopurine S methyltranferase deficiency: Thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize thiopurine drugs. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is an enzyme that the body uses to break down thiopurine drugs. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency patients have a genetic change in either one or both copies of the TPMT gene that causes reduced enzyme activity and difficulties breaking down thiopurine drugs. Affected individuals are at a high risk of experiencing bone marrow damage if they take thiopurine drugs. Many patients recover from the bone marrow damage once thiopurine drug use is stopped. When the bone marrow is damaged, infections can cause health problems."
"Summary of Thomas syndrome: Thomas syndrome is characterised by renal anomalies, cardiac malformations and cleft lip or palate. It has been described in six patients. Transmission was suggested to be autosomal recessive."
"Summary of X-linked thrombocytopenia with normal platelets: The WAS-related disorders, which include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT), and X-linked congenital neutropenia (XLN), are a spectrum of disorders of hematopoietic cells, with predominant defects of platelets and lymphocytes caused by pathogenic variants in WAS. WAS-related disorders usually present in infancy. Affected males have thrombocytopenia with intermittent mucosal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, and intermittent or chronic petechiae and purpura; eczema; and recurrent bacterial and viral infections, particularly of the ear. At least 40% of those who survive the early complications develop one or more autoimmune conditions including hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, immune-mediated neutropenia, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, and immune-mediated damage to the kidneys and liver. Individuals with a WAS-related disorder, particularly those who have been exposed to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are at increased risk of developing lymphomas, which often occur in unusual, extranodal locations including the brain, lung, or gastrointestinal tract. Males with XLT have thrombocytopenia with small platelets; other complications of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, including eczema and immune dysfunction, are usually mild or absent. Males with XLN have congenital neutropenia, myeloid dysplasia, and lymphoid cell abnormalities."
"Summary of Thoracic dysplasia-hydrocephalus syndrome: Thoracic dysplasia-hydrocephalus syndrome is an extremely rare primary bone dysplasia syndrome characterized by short ribs with a narrow chest and thoracic dysplasia, mild rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, communicating hydrocephalus, and developmental delay. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1987."
"Summary of Thoraco-abdominal enteric duplication: Thoraco-abdominal enteric duplication is a rare, syndromic intestinal malformation characterized by single or multiple smooth-walled, often tubular, cystic lesions, which on occasion contain ectopic gastric mucosa, located in the thorax (usually in the posterior mediastinum and to the right of the midline) and in the abdomen. Infants usually present with respiratory distress and older patients with heartburn, abdominal pain, vomiting and/or melena. Vertebral anomalies in the lower cervical spine, with CNS involvement, are frequently present and complications, such as bowel obstruction, perforation and intussusception, have also been reported."
Summary of Thoracopelvic dysostosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of KRT1-related diffuse nonepidermolytic keratoderma: KRT1-related diffuse nonepidermolytic keratoderma (Unna-Thost palmoplantar keratoderma) is a type of diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma that mostly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It usually begins in early childhood with redness of the palms and soles. The palms and soles gradually become thicker and develop a yellowish, waxy appearance. Increased sweating (hyperhidrosis) is quite common and there is a tendency to fungal and bacterial infections of the feet. This condition usually does not extend beyond the hands and feet. It may affect the knuckle pads and nails, but usually does not involve the thin skin on the top of the feet or hands. KRT1-related diffuse nonepidermolytic keratoderma is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and caused by genetic changes in the KRT1 gene."
"Summary of Stormorken-Sjaastad-Langslet syndrome: Stormorken-Sjaastad-Langslet syndrome is characterized by thrombocytopathy, asplenia, miosis, muscle fatigue, migraine, dyslexia, and ichthyosis. It has been described in six members of one family. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait."
"Summary of Thrombocytopenia 2: Thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2) is a condition that affects the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are important for blood clotting. People with THC2 have a reduced number of platelets, which can cause mild bleeding. The platelets that are present  look and work correctly, as does the bone marrow (where platelets are made). The low platelet count may be due to the body not producing enough of them or because it is not releasing them properly. THC2 is caused by changes in the ANKRD26 gene. It follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
Summary of Thrombocytopenia Robin sequence: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Immune thrombocytopenia: Immune thrombocytopenia, also known as Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding disorder characterized by too few platelets in the blood. This is because platelets are being destroyed by the immune system. Symptoms may include bruising, nosebleed or bleeding in the mouth, bleeding into the skin, and abnormally heavy menstruation. Rarely, ITP may become a chronic ailment in adults and reappear, even after remission."
"Summary of Familial thrombomodulin anomalies: Familial thrombomodulin anomalies is a rare, life-threatening, genetic coagulation disorder characterized by an increased risk of blood clot formation in several members of a family due to a thrombomodulin gene mutation. Patients may manifest with venous thromboembolic disease, premature myocardial infarction and/or arterial thrombosis."

"Summary of Thymic-renal-anal-lung dysplasia: This syndrome is characterised by intrauterine growth retardation, renal dysgenesis and a unilobed or absent thymus."
Summary of Thyrocerebral-retinal syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Familial thyroglossal duct cyst: Familial thyroglossal duct cyst is a rare hereditary form of a benign congenital neck mass, known as a thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC). TDC is the most common congenital midline neck mass in the pediatric population. They present as a painless, palpable mass that develops around the midline and moves with swallowing. Other symptoms might include: fluctuation in size of mass, dysphagia, infection of mass, and mid-neck tenderness. TDCs are caused by abnormal development of the thyroid gland in fetal development. The cause of this abnormal development is largely not known and usually sporadic; however, in rare circumstances TDCs can be inherited. Familial TDC are commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with rare reports of autosomal recessive inheritance."
"Summary of Thyroid cancer, nonmedullary, 2: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Absent tibia-polydactyly-arachnoid cyst syndrome: Tibia absent - polydactyly - arachnoid cyst syndrome is a very rare constellation of multiple anomalies, including absence or hypoplasia of the tibia."
"Summary of Tick-borne encephalitis: Tick-borne encephalitis is caused by an arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family (tick-borne encephalitis virus, TBEV), transmitted principally by the bite of the Ixodes ricinus tick. The symptomology is biphasic, with the initial phase being associated with a flu-like illness and the second phase (occurring in less than 10% of patients) with symptoms of meningitis or, more rarely, meningoencephalitis."
Summary of Tollner Horst Manzke syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies: Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a disorder that affects peripheral nerves, causing the nerves to be highly sensitive to pressure. Symptoms usually begin during adolescence or early adulthood but may develop anytime from childhood to late adulthood. Symptoms vary in severity. While some people never realize they have the disorder, others experience prolonged disability. The most common problem sites involve nerves in the wrists, elbows, and knees; however, the fingers, shoulders, hands, feet, and scalp can also be affected. Symptoms associated with HNPP occur in episodes, due to pressure on any single peripheral nerve. Symptoms may include numbness, tingling, and/or loss of muscle function (palsy), pain in the limbs (especially the hands), carpal tunnel syndrome (impairing the ability to use the fingers, hands, and wrists), and foot drop (making it hard or impossible to walk, climb stairs, or drive). Some people experience fatigue, generalized weakness, muscle cramps, pain in the muscles or bones, or lower back pain. An episode of symptoms associated with HNPP can last from several minutes to days or even months. Most people completely recover after an episode, but repeated episodes can cause permanent muscle weakness or loss of sensation. HNPP is most often caused by the loss of one copy (a deletion) of the PMP22 gene, but it may also be cause by a genetic change within this gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The diagnosis is made based on the symptoms present, electrodiagnostic testing, and genetic testing. HNPP is thought to be underdiagnosed, and it may be misdiagnosed as another disorder such as Charcot-Marie Tooth disease."
"Summary of Toriello-Carey syndrome: Toriello-Carey syndrome is a rare condition characterized by multiple congenital anomalies. Signs and symptoms can vary but may include distinctive craniofacial features, brain abnormalities, Pierre Robin sequence, swallowing difficulties, heart defects, low muscle tone (hypotonia), and moderate to severe intellectual disability. The genetic cause is not fully understood, but there is evidence it may be caused by genetic changes in one or more unidentified genes, or by a chromosome abnormality. When it is not due to a chromosome abnormality, inheritance is thought to be autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Torticollis-keloids-cryptorchidism-renal dysplasia syndrome: Torticollis-keloids-cryptorchidism-renal dysplasia syndrome is an extremely rare developmental defect during embryogenesis malformation syndrome characterized by congenital muscular torticollis associated with skin anomalies (such as multiple keloids, pigmented nevi, epithelioma), urogenital malformations (including cryptorchidism and hypospadias) and renal dysplasia (e.g. chronic pyelonephritis, renal atrophy). Additional reported features include varicose veins, intellectual disability and musculoskeletal anomalies."
"Summary of Skin fragility-woolly hair-palmoplantar keratoderma syndrome: Skin fragility-woolly hair-palmoplantar keratoderma syndrome is a rare, genetic, ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by persistent skin fragility which manifests with blistering and erosions due to minimal trauma, woolly hair with variable alopecia, hyperkeratotic nail dysplasia, diffuse or focal palmoplantar keratoderma with painful fissuring, and no cardiac abnormalities. Perioral hyperkeratosis may also be associated."
"Summary of Weismann-Netter syndrome: Weismann-Netter syndrome is a rare, genetic, primary, bent bone dysplasia characterized by anterior diaphyseal bowing of the tibia and fibula, broadening of the fibula, posterior cortical thickening of both bones and short stature. Additional skeletal abnormalities include scoliosis with marked lumbar lordosis, horizontal sacrum and square iliac wings and/or, less frequently, vertebral malformations, abnormal shape of the clavicles and ribs, calvarial hyperostosis and delayed eruption of permanent teeth. Delayed ambulation is also frequently associated."
"Summary of Tracheal agenesis: Tracheal agenesis is a rare birth defect in which the trachea (windpipe) is completely absent (agenesis) or significantly underdeveloped (atresia). Signs and symptoms include polyhydramnios during pregnancy and respiratory distress, bluish skin color (cyanosis) and no audible cry shortly after birth. The underlying cause of Tracheal agenesis is currently unknown. Approximately 90% of cases are associated with other anomalies, including those of the cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal system and the genitourinary tract. Some cases may be part of a very rare condition known as VACTERL association."
Summary of Tracheobronchomegaly: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica: Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (TO) is a rare condition of the large airways. It is characterized by the presence of multiple growths (nodules) made of bone and cartilage tissue, in the submucosa of the tracheobronchial wall. The nodules protrude into the spaces inside the trachea and bronchi, which can lead to airway obstruction. Affected people may have persisting or recurrent respiratory symptoms, and/or recurrent infections. The cause of TO is not currently known."
"Summary of Hypoplastic pancreas-intestinal atresia-hypoplastic gallbladder syndrome: Hypoplastic pancreas-intestinal atresia-hypoplastic gallbladder syndrome is a rare genetic condition that affects the digestive system. It can be very serious and even life-threatening. It can cause neonatal diabetes, hypoplastic or annular pancreas (pancreas is underdeveloped or has an abnormal shape). It can also cause duodenal and jejunal atresia (parts of the small intestine are blocked or missing), gallbladder aplasia or hypoplasia (gallbladder is missing or underdeveloped), and intestinal malrotation (intestines not in their normal position which can cause problems with digestion and nutrient absorption). This may lead to malnutrition and malabsorption which means the body is not getting or absorbing the nutrients it needs to function. This can cause fetuses to not grow as much as they should in the womb and babies and children to not grow or gain weight. Other symptoms include conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (there is too much bilirubin in the blood, which can cause yellowing of the skin and eyes), acholia (lack of bile in the stool, which can cause pale or clay-colored stools), and infections."
"Summary of X-linked intellectual disability-seizures-psoriasis syndrome: X-linked intellectual disability-seizures-psoriasis syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by intellectual disability, seizures and psoriasis. The underlying genetic cause of the condition is currently unknown; however, it is thought to be inherited in an X-linked manner."
Summary of Transcobalamin 1 deficiency: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autosomal dominant optic atrophy plus syndrome: Autosomal dominant optic atrophy plus syndrome (ADOA plus) is a rare syndrome that causes vision loss, hearing loss, and symptoms affecting the muscles. The syndrome is associated with degeneration of the optic nerve (optic atrophy). The optic nerve sends signals about what the eyes are seeing to the brain. When there is optic nerve damage, it causes vision loss. Other symptoms of ADOA plus include sensorineural hearing loss and symptoms affecting the muscles such as muscle pain and weakness. ADOA plus is caused by changes in the OPA1 gene. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A diagnosis of ADOA plus is suspected when an eye exam finds degeneration of the optic nerve (optic atrophy). The diagnosis can be confirmed with a muscle biopsy and genetic testing of the OPA1 gene."
"Summary of Tremor hereditary essential, 1: Essential tremor may be the most common human movement disorder. The main feature of essential tremor is postural tremor of the arms, but the head, legs, trunk, voice, jaw, and facial muscles also may be involved. Aggravated by emotions, hunger, fatigue, and temperature extremes, the condition may cause a functional disability or even incapacitation. Autosomal dominant inheritance can be demonstrated in most families (summary by Higgins et al., 1997).Deng et al. (2007) provided a detailed review of the genetics of essential tremor.Genetic Heterogeneity of Essential TremorOther forms of hereditary essential tremor include ETM2 (602134), mapped to chromosome 2p25-p22; ETM3 (611456), mapped to chromosome 6p23; ETM4 (614782), caused by mutation in the FUS gene (137070) on chromosome 16p11; ETM5 (616736), caused by mutation in the TENM4 gene (610084) on chromosome 11q14; and ETM6 (618866), caused by mutation in the NOTCH2NLC gene (618025) on chromosome 1q21."
"Summary of Trichinellosis: Trichinellosis is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by the consumption of raw or undercooked meat (pork and wild game) infected by nematodes of the genus Trichinella and that is characterized by an enteral (intestinal) phase, that can be asymptomatic or that can manifests with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, and a parenteral (muscular) phase, manifesting with fever, periorbital edema, muscle swelling and pain, weakness, and in some cases, skin rash and peripheral edema. Rarely, potentially fatal cardiac (i.e. myocarditis), pulmonary (i.e. pneumonitis, respiratory failure), and nervous system (i.e. meningoencephalitis) complications may occur."
"Summary of Syndromic diarrhea: Syndromic diarrhea is a condition that affects the hair, liver, and intestines. The condition is characterized by chronic diarrhea that begins during the first six months after birth. Continued diarrhea can lead to an inability to gain weight (failure to thrive). Syndromic diarrhea also causes liver disease such as cirrhosis (chronic liver damage) or hepatomegaly (swollen liver). Affected individuals may have wooly or patchy hair. Syndromic diarrhea is caused by genetic changes in TTC37or SKIV2L and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Trichodysplasia-xeroderma syndrome: Trichodysplasia-xeroderma syndrome is an extremely rare, syndromic hair shaft anomaly characterized by sparse, coarse, brittle, excessively dry and slow-growing scalp hair, sparse axillary and pubic hair, sparse or absent eyelashes and eyebrows and dry skin.

There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1983."
"Summary of Trichostasis spinulosa: Trichostasis spinulosa (TS) is a condition where instead of one hair protruding from a hair follicle, a bundle or bush of hair come out of a single follicle. This results in elevated, dark spiny papules on the head, face (usually the nose), and trunk. In this condition, there are numerous tiny open pores filled with multiple tiny short hairs, usually only visible with a magnifying glass. TS usually does not cause problems and may only be noticed as an incidental finding. The exact cause is unknown."
"Summary of Tricuspid atresia: A rare congenital heart malformation characterized by absence of the tricuspid valuvar annulus (absent right atrioventricular connection/junction) or an imperforate tricuspid valve leading to severe hypoplasia of right ventricle (functionally univentricular heart). The malformation is associated with normally related great arteries (70 to 80% of cases) or transposed great vessels, an obligatory interatrial connection that is crucial for survival (patent oval foramen or atrial septal defect ostium secundum type), ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary outflow obstruction (pulmonary atresia, stenosis or hypoplasia), aortic coarctation and/or aortic arch interruption."
Summary of Trigonocephaly bifid nose acral anomalies: This section is currently in development.

Pachygyria - epilepsy - intellectual disability - dysmorphism (Fryns-Aftimos syndrome (FA); see this term) corresponds to the appearance of BWS in elderly patients."
Summary of Triopia: Triopia is a rare condition that affects development in the womb. Babies born with this condition may have an extra eye or one eye that is unusually large (synophthalmic eye). People with the condition also have other birth defects affecting the brain and face. A proboscis (poorly formed nose) is often present. People with Triopia usually have moderate intellectual disability and may experience seizures.
"Summary of Triose phosphate-isomerase deficiency: Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) deficiency is a severe disorder characterized by a shortage of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), neurological problems, infections, and muscle weakness that can affect breathing and heart function. TPI deficiency is the most severe form of a group of diseases known as glycolytic enzymopathies, which are rare genetic diseases that lead to the degeneration of the red blood cells. Signs and symptoms include anemia, fatigue, pallor, yellowing of the skin and the white of the eyes (jaundice), and shortness of breath. Other symptoms are muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy), movement problems (such as involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), tremors and weak muscle tone), seizures, cardiomyopathy, and diaphragm weakness which may cause breathing problems and lead to respiratory failure. The disease is caused by genetic changes in the TPI1 gene. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
Summary of Triphalangeal thumb non opposable: A form of triphalangeal thumb that cannot be placed opposite the fingers of the same hand.
"Summary of Polydactyly of a triphalangeal thumb: Polydactyly of a triphalangeal thumb or PPD2 is a form of preaxial polydactyly of fingers (see this term), a limb malformation syndrome, that is characterized by the presence of a usually opposable triphalangeal thumb with or without additional duplication of one or more skeletal components of the thumb. The thumb appearance can differ widely in shape (wedge to rectangular) or it can be deviated in the radio-ulnar plane (clinodactyly). PPD2 is also associated with systemic syndromes, including Holt-Oram syndrome and Fanconi anemia (see these terms)."
"Summary of Triphalangeal thumbs-brachyectrodactyly syndrome: A rare genetic syndrome with limb duplication, polydactyly, syndactyly, and/or hyperphalangy characterized by duplication anomalies such as triphalangeal thumbs, phalangeal duplication of other digits, and polydactyly, associated with highly variable combinations of ectrodactyly, brachydactyly, and syndactyly of hands and/or feet. Severe nail dysplasia or absence of nails is also observed."
"Summary of Triploidy: Triploidy is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra set of chromosomes present in each cell. The signs and symptoms associated with Triploidy vary but may include a variety of birth defects and an unusually small size. Those with the mosaic form, the form in which only some cells in the body have an extra set of chromosomes, may have less severe signs and symptoms. This condition does not run in families and is not associated with maternal or paternal age."
"Summary of Trisomy 10p: Trisomy 10p is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 10. The severity and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. The size of the duplication can range from a tiny piece of the chromosome arm, to the entire arm. Signs and symptoms that can be present in a person with Trisomy 10p may include delay of development, motor skills, or growth; short stature; low muscle tone (hypotonia); abnormalities of the foot (such as clubfoot); cleft lip and/or cleft palate; and distinctive facial features. Other signs and symptoms may include seizures, a heart defect, or other birth defects. Some 10p duplications are not inherited and occur sporadically (randomly) when egg or sperm cells form, or shortly after the egg and sperm join together. In other cases, the duplication occurs because a parent has a chromosome rearrangement such as a balanced translocation or a pericentric inversion (neither of which usually causes health problems). A chromosome test of both parents can help determine whether the duplication was inherited, and whether future children have an increased chance to have a chromosome abnormality."
"Summary of Mosaic trisomy 12: Mosaic trisomy 12 is a rare condition caused by a problem with a person's chromosomes. The symptoms are highly variable and may include developmental or growth delay and short stature. It can also cause unusual facial features, such as a tall forehead, downslanting eyes, and narrow palate. Mosaic trisomy 12 can affect the heart and skin, and weaken muscles. Some people with mosaic trisomy 12 may also have scoliosis, hearing loss, facial or body asymmetry, or intellectual disability."
"Summary of Trisomy 12p: Trisomy 12p is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 12. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Trisomy 12p include macrocephaly (unusually large head), abnormal muscle tone, characteristic facial features, developmental delay and intellectual disability. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the duplication on to their children."

"Summary of Mosaic trisomy 15: Mosaic trisomy 15 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome principally characterized by intrauterine growth restriction, congenital cardiac anomalies (incl. ventricular and atrial septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus) and craniofacial dysmorphism (incl. hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, wide nasal bridge). Patients also present brain (e.g. hypoplastic cerebellum, ventricular asymmetry), renal (e.g. small dysplastic kidneys), and/or genital (undescended testis, small penis, hypoplastic labia majora) anomalies. Digital and skin pigmentation abnormalities have also been reported."
"Summary of Chromosome 15q duplication: Chromosome 15q duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when an extra (duplicate) copy of the genetic material located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 15 is present in each cell. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary based on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Common features shared by many people with this duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia (low muscle tone), seizures, high and/or cleft palate (roof of the mouth), scoliosis, slow growth, communication difficulties, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, although affected people can pass the duplication on to their children."
"Summary of Chromosome 16p duplication: Chromosome 16p duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 16. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that may occur in people with Chromosome 16p duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the duplication on to their children."
Summary of Chromosome 16q duplication: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Mosaic trisomy 17: Trisomy 17 mosaicism is a chromosomal abnormality in which there are three copies of chromosome 17 in some cells of the body, rather than the usual two copies. It is often incorrectly called trisomy 17 (also referred to as full trisomy 17), which is when three copies of chromosome 17 are present in all cells of the body. Few cases of Trisomy 17 mosaicism have been described, most having been detected during pregnancy through a test called amniocentesis. Because the proportion and location of cells with trisomy 17 differs from case to case, the presence and severity of signs and symptoms may vary significantly from person to person."
"Summary of Trisomy 17p: Trisomy 17p is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 17. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Trisomy 17p include slowed growth both before and after birth; developmental delay; reduced muscle tone (hypotonia); congenital heart defects; and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited and occur randomly when the parents' sperm or egg cells formed, or very shortly after the egg and sperm joined. In some cases, the duplication is inherited from a parent with a chromosome abnormality (who may or may not have symptoms of a chromosome abnormality). Whether or not the duplication was inherited from a parent, a person with the duplication can pass it on to his or her child."
Summary of Chromosome 17q duplication: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Trisomy 18p: Trisomy 18p is a rare chromosome abnormality in which there are three copies of the short (p) arm of chromosome 18 in each cell, rather than the usual two copies. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplicated genetic material and which genes are involved. A complete duplication of the p arm of chromosome 18 is rare. Reported features include: intellectual disability, foot or hand anomalies, distinctive facial features, and epilepsy. Trisomy 18p may occur sporadically in a family with no previous history or may be inherited from a parent with the same duplication or another chromosome abnormality, such as a balanced translocation."
"Summary of Chromosome 18q duplication: Duplication of the long arm of chromosome 18 with variable abnormalities, including intra-uterine growth retardation; characteristic facies with malformed ears, micrognathia, and prominent occiput; heart malformations; and psychomotor retardation."
"Summary of Chromosome 19q duplication: Duplication of the long arm of chromosome 19 with psychomotor retardation, microbrachycephaly, open cranial sutures, downslanting palpebral fissures, blepharoptosis, hypertelorism, downturned corners of the mouth, and short nose. The severity of symptoms is related to the length of the duplicated segment."
"Summary of Mosaic trisomy 2: Trisomy 2 mosaicism is a rare chromosome disorder characterized by having an extra copy of chromosome 2 in a proportion, but not all, of a person's cells. In infants born with Trisomy 2 mosaicism, severity as well as signs and symptoms vary widely. Features of Trisomy 2 mosaicism may include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), any of various birth defects, distinctive facial features, growth delay, developmental delays, and intellectual disabilities. The severity and specific symptoms present generally depend on the level of mosaicism (the proportion of cells affected) and the location or type of affected cells in the body. Trisomy 2 mosaicism is not inherited. It is caused by a random error in cell division during early development of the embryo. When Trisomy 2 mosaicism is detected during early pregnancy with chorionic villus sampling (CVS), the affected cells may be confined only to the placenta, and not present in the fetus. Amniocentesis may be recommended to confirm the results of the CVS, and monitoring may occur to detect intrauterine growth restriction, low amniotic fluid level (oligohydramnios), or other complications including stillbirth."
"Summary of Chromosome 20 trisomy: Chromosome 20 trisomy, (also called trisomy 20) is a condition in which a fetus or individual has an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 20 in some or all of of his/her cells. The presence of an extra copy of only part of chromosome 20 is called partial trisomy 20; and an extra copy of chromosome 20 in only some of a person's cells is called mosaic trisomy 20. Mosaic trisomy 20 is the most common type of Chromosome 20 trisomy and is one of the more common chromosomal abnormalities found during prenatal diagnostic testing. However, features that have been reported include spinal abnormalities (including spinal stenosis, vertebral fusion, and kyphosis), hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), lifelong constipation, sloped shoulders, and significant learning disabilities despite normal intelligence. Trisomy 20 usually results from an error that occurs when an egg or sperm cell develops (before fertilization); mosaic trisomy 20 usually results from errors in cell division soon after fertilization."
"Summary of Trisomy 20p: Trisomy 20p is a rare chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy (duplication) of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 20. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. In general, smaller duplications are less severe than larger duplications. The majority of those have been partial duplications (involving only part of the p arm) and have occurred as part of a translocation (along with a deletion on another chromosome). Therefore, it is hard to know which symptoms in people with Trisomy 20p have been due to the duplication specifically. Signs and symptoms that have been reported in people with Trisomy 20p include intellectual disability, developmental delay, speech delay, poor coordination, dental problems, spinal bone abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and heart problems. Most cases of Trisomy 20p have resulted from a healthy parent having a chromosomal balanced translocation or inversion (when a piece of a chromosome is facing the wrong direction). When a parent has one of these, there is an increased risk to have another child with a chromosome abnormality. Some Trisomy 20p have resulted from a random genetic error (not inherited), in which both parents have normal chromosomes. In these cases, it is unlikely the parents would have another child with a chromosome abnormality."
"Summary of Trisomy 22: Trisomy 22 is a chromosome disorder in which an extra (third) copy of chromosome 22 is present in every cell of the body where there should normally only be two copies. Common features include an underdeveloped midface (midface hypoplasia) with flat/broad nasal bridge, malformed ears with pits or tags, cleft palate, hypertelorism (wide-spaced eyes), microcephaly and other cranial abnormalities, congenital heart disease, genital abnormalities, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)."
"Summary of Chromosome 2p duplication: Chromosome 2p duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 2. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 2p duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the duplication on to their children."
"Summary of Chromosome 2q duplication: Chromosome 2q duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 2. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 2q duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the duplication on to their children."
"Summary of Mosaic trisomy 3: Mosaic trisomy 3 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with high phenotypic variability ranging from a mild phenotype presenting joint pain and laxity, mild facial dysmorphism (e.g. long facies, prominent eyes, dysplastic ears, downturned corners of the mouth, micrognathia) and no developmental delays to more severe phenotypes including short stature, intellectual disability, severe developmental delays, additional craniofacial dysmorphic features (e.g. brachycephaly, high forehead, flat midface, short neck) and hearing impairment, as well as skeletal (e.g. pectus excavatum, scoliosis), ocular (e.g. coloboma) and cardiac abnormalities."
"Summary of Chromosome 3p duplication: Chromosome 3p duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 3. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 3p duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome 3p duplication can be de novo (not inherited and occurring for the first time in that family) or inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation."
"Summary of Chromosome 3q duplication: Chromosome 3q duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 3. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that may be present in a person with a Chromosome 3q duplication include distinctive facial features, hirsutism (excessive hair growth in women), small head size (microcephaly), intellectual disability, slowed growth, and abnormalities of the hands, feet, genitourinary system, kidneys, and/or heart. Various other neurologic abnormalities or birth defects affecting other parts of the body may also occur. Chromosome 3q duplication can be de novo (not inherited and occurring for the first time in that family), or inherited from a parent with a chromosomal rearrangement such as a balanced translocation. In most cases, it occurs as part of an unbalanced translocation, which means that abnormalities of other chromosomes are also present."
"Summary of Chromosome 4q duplication: Chromosome 4q duplication is a chromosome abnormality characterized by an extra copy (duplication) of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 4. The severity and specific symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication, and which genes are involved. Features that have been described in some people with Chromosome 4q duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, birth defects, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are inherited from an unaffected parent with a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation. Some cases are not inherited and occur sporadically."
"Summary of Chromosome 5q duplication: Chromosome 5q duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 5. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 5q duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features.

The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 6p duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. This condition can occur sporadically or be inherited from a parent with the duplication (who is mildy affected) or carries a balanced translocation."
"Summary of Chromosome 6q duplication: Chromosome 6q duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 6. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 6q duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. In most cases, Chromosome 6q duplication occurs de novo (occurring for the first time in that family) or is inherited from a parent with a chromosomal rearrangement such as a balanced translocation. Rarely, it is inherited from a parent with the same duplication."
"Summary of Mosaic trisomy 7: Mosaic trisomy 7 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome, with a highly variable phenotype, mostly characterized by blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia, body asymmetry, enamel dysplasia, and developmental and growth delay. Intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism (e.g. frontal bossing, abnormal palpebral fissures, strabismus, abnormally shaped ears, and micrognathia), and genital anomalies (e.g. undescended testes) have also been observed. It has been reported to be associated with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7, resulting in a Silver-Russell syndrome phenotype. Cases with no associated malformations have also been reported."
"Summary of Chromosome 7p duplication: Chromosome 7p duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 7.

Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the duplication on to their children."
"Summary of Chromosome 7q duplication: Chromosome 7q duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 7. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 7q duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the duplication on to their children."
"Summary of Mosaic trisomy 8: Mosaic trisomy 8 is a chromosomal abnormality that can affect many parts of the body. In individuals with Mosaic trisomy 8, some of the body's cells have three copies of chromosome 8 (trisomy), while other cells have the usual two copies of this chromosome. The signs and symptoms vary, but may include distinctive facial features; intellectual disability; and joint, kidney, cardiac, and skeletal abnormalities. Males are more frequently affected than females. Most cases are not inherited; it often occurs sporadically as a random event during the formation of the reproductive cells (egg and sperm). Diagnosis may be based on analysis of chromosomes via genetic testing, such as karyotype."
"Summary of Chromosome 8p duplication: Chromosome 8p duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 8. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 8p duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the duplication on to their children."
"Summary of Trisomy 8q: Trisomy 8q is a rare chromosome abnormality characterized by an extra copy (duplication) of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 8. The symptoms and severity depend on the size and location of the duplication, which genes are involved, and whether other chromosome abnormalities are also present. Some features only occur when a particular section of the chromosome is duplicated. Features that have been more commonly reported in people with a Trisomy 8q include developmental delay, learning difficulties, congenital heart defects, skeletal abnormalities, genital or urinary abnormalities, and distinctive facial features. Most cases of Trisomy 8q are not inherited from a parent and occur by chance in people with no family history of chromosome abnormalities. In some cases, one parent has a rearrangement of chromosomal material, such as a balanced translocation or inversion, that increases the risk to have a child with a Trisomy 8q. Regardless of whether the duplication was inherited from a parent, a person with the duplication has an increased risk to have a child with a chromosome abnormality."
"Summary of Chromosome 9p duplication: Chromosome 9p duplication is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 9. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 9p duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the duplication was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation, where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having a child with a chromosomal anomaly like a duplication."
"Summary of Chromosome Xq duplication: Chromosome Xq duplication is a chromosome abnormality that affects many different parts of the body. People with this condition have an extra copy of the genetic material located on the long arm (q) of the X chromosome in each cell. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary based on the size and location of the duplication; the genes involved; and the sex of the affected person. In general, males are typically more severely affected than females and often experience intellectual disability, developmental delay, short stature, abnormalities of the reproductive organs, and distinctive craniofacial features. Many females with this duplication do not have any symptoms or are only affected with short stature; however, some may be just as severely affected as males with the condition. Most cases are inherited in an X-linked manner, often from a mother with no signs or symptoms of the condition."
Summary of Trochlear dysplasia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 20: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 2 is a neurological disorder and one of the many types of hereditary spastic paraplegia. Signs and symptoms typically begin in early childhood and may include progressive muscle weakness and stiffness (spasticity) in the legs, muscle wasting in the hands and feet, paraplegia, leg contractures, developmental delays, speech difficulty, mood swings, and short stature. Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 2 is caused by genetic changes in the SPG20 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Trueb Burg Bottani syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Transient tyrosinemia of the newborn: Transient tyrosinemia of the newborn is a benign disorder of tyrosine metabolism detected upon newborn screening and often observed in premature infants. It shows no clinical symptoms. It is characterized by tyrosinemia, moderate hyperphenylalaninemia, and tyrosiluria that usually resolve after 2 months of age."
"Summary of Galactose epimerase deficiency: A very rare, moderate to severe form of galactosemia characterized by moderate to severe signs of impaired galactose metabolism."
"Summary of Ulbright-Hodes syndrome: Ulbright-Hodes syndrome is characterised by renal dysplasia, growth retardation, phocomelia or mesomelia, radiohumeral fusion, rib abnormalities, anomalies of the external genitalia and a potter-like facies. The syndrome has been described in three infants (one pair of sibs and an unrelated case), all of whom died shortly after birth from respiratory distress resulting from pulmonary hypoplasia and oligohydramnios caused by renal dysplasia. The mode of transmission appears to be autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Ulerythema ophryogenesis: Ulerythema ophryogenesis is characterised by inflammatory keratotic papules occurring on the face, which may be followed by scars, atrophy and alopecia. Prevalence is unknown but the disease, affecting mainly children and young adults, is rare. Erythema with mild hyperkeratosis of the hair follicles resulting in rough papules is observed on the cheeks and lateral aspects of the eyebrows. The disorder occasionally extends to the adjacent scalp, ears and forehead and rarely to the extensor surfaces of the limbs. Symptoms regress with age, although loss of the lateral aspects of the eyebrows can occur. Many cases occur sporadically; autosomal dominant inheritance has also been reported. There is no particular treatment, but patients should avoid sun exposure without UV protection."
"Summary of Ulna hypoplasia-intellectual disability syndrome: Ulna hypoplasia - intellectual deficit is a very rare syndrome characterized by mesomelic shortness of the forearms, bilateral clubfeet, aplasia or hypoplasia of all nails and severe psychomotor retardation."
"Summary of Ulnar hypoplasia-split foot syndrome: Ulnar hypoplasia-split foot syndrome is characterised by the association of severe ulnar hypoplasia, absence of fingers two to five, and split-foot. It has been described in four males belonging to two generations of the same family. X-linked recessive inheritance is suggested, but autosomal dominant transmission cannot be excluded."
"Summary of Umbilical cord ulceration-intestinal atresia syndrome: A rare syndromic intestinal malformation characterized by ulcer formation in the umbilical cord associated with congenital upper-intestinal atresia, typically presenting with intra-uterine hemorrhaging from the ulcer site and subsequent fetal bradycardia."
"Summary of Uncombable hair syndrome: Uncombable hair syndrome (UHS) is a rare disorder of the hair shaft of the scalp. It is usually characterized by silvery-blond or straw-colored hair that is disorderly; stands out from the scalp; and cannot be combed flat. Most cases are isolated, but in some cases it has been described in association with other diseases, such as ectodermal dysplasias, Bork syndrome and Angel-shaped phalangoepiphyseal dysplasia. The syndrome has been found to be caused by genetic changes in the genes PADI3, TGM3, and TCHH. These three genes code for proteins that are involved in hair shaft formation. The syndrome appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion; however, cases inherited in an autosomal dominant manner may also exist, as there are other genes involved in hair formation. The condition often spontaneously regresses in late childhood."

There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1971."
"Summary of Urachal cyst: A Urachal cyst is a sac-like pocket of tissue that develops in the urachus, a structure that connects the umbilical cord to the bladder in the developing baby. Although it normally disappears prior to birth, part of the urachus may remain in some people. Urachal cysts can develop at any age, but typically affect older children and adults. Urachal cysts are often not associated with any signs or symptoms unless there are complications such as infection. In these cases, symptoms may include abdominal pain, fever, pain with urination and/or hematuria."
"Summary of Urban-Rogers-Meyer syndrome: Urban-Rogers-Meyer syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, short stature, obesity, genital abnormalities, and hand and/or toe contractures. Other symptoms included unusual face, deformity of the spinal column, osteoporosis and a history of frequent fractures. The cause is currently unknown."
"Summary of Hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia: Hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia (HMD) is a condition that affects the skin, hair, mucosa (areas of the body that are lined with mucus), gums (gingiva), eyes, nose and lungs. Symptoms begin in infancy and vary in severity from person to person. The most common symptoms of this condition include hair loss (alopecia), patchy red skin around the perineum (the area between the anus and external genitalia); and red gums. Small, skin-colored bumps (keratosis pilaris) and early development of cloudy lens (cataracts) are also common. Other symptoms may include eye disease that gets worse over time, lung disease and a rough, red tongue. Intelligence is normal. The exact cause of HMD is still unknown, but it is thought to be an abnormality in desmosomes and gap junctions, which are cell structures involved in cell-to-cell contact. HMD appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but has occurred in individuals with no family history of the condition. The diagnosis of HMD is based on the symptoms and other skin and eye disorders need to be excluded."
"Summary of Urethral obstruction sequence: In its rare complete form, 'prune belly' syndrome comprises megacystis (massively enlarged bladder) with disorganized detrusor muscle, cryptorchidism, and thin abdominal musculature with overlying lax skin (summary by Weber et al., 2011)."
"Summary of Hereditary orotic aciduria: Orotic aciduria type I (OA1), also known as hereditary orotic aciduria, is a condition characterized by elevated levels of orotic acid in the urine. It typically becomes apparent in the first months of life with megaloblastic anemia, as well as delays in physical and intellectual development. OA1 is caused by changes in the UMPS gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. OA1 differs from other causes of orotic aciduria, which may include mitochondrial disorders, lysinuric protein intolerance, and liver disease."
"Summary of Müllerian derivatives-lymphangiectasia-polydactyly syndrome: A rare genetic disease characterized by the presence of MÃ¼llerian duct derivatives (rudimentary uterus, fallopian tubes, and atretic vagina) and other genital anomalies (cryptorchidism, micropenis) in male newborns, intestinal and pulmonary lymphangiectasia, protein-losing enteropathy, hepatomegaly, and renal anomalies. Postaxial polydactyly, facial dysmorphism (including broad nasal bridge, bulbous nasal tip, long and prominent upper lip with smooth philtrum, hypertrophic alveolar ridges, and mild retrognathia, among other features), and short limbs have also been described. The syndrome is fatal in infancy."
Summary of Urogenital adysplasia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Usher syndrome type 1: Usher syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss or deafness and progressive vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa. Sensorineural hearing means it is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear. Retinitis pigmentosa is an eye disease that affects the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Night vision loss begins first, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision, that can enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision (loss of all peripheral vision). In some cases, vision is further impaired by clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Usher syndrome type 2: Usher syndrome type 2A is a genetic condition characterized by hearing loss from birth and progressive vision loss that usually begins in adolescence or adulthood. Vision loss is due to retinitis pigmentosa. Night vision loss begins first, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision. In some cases, vision is further impaired by clouding of the front surface of the eye (cataracts). Hearing loss ranges from mild to severe and mainly affects high tones. The degree of hearing loss varies within and among families with this condition. Unlike other forms of Usher syndrome, people with type 2A do not have difficulties with balance caused by inner ear problems. Usher syndrome type 2A is caused by genetic changes the USH2A gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Usher syndrome type 3: Usher syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss or deafness and progressive vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa. Sensorineural hearing means it is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear. Retinitis pigmentosa is an eye disease that affects the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Night vision loss begins first, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision, that can enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision (loss of all peripheral vision). In some cases, vision is further impaired by clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of VACTERL/VATER association: VACTERL/VATER association is a non-random association of birth defects that affects multiple parts of the body. The term VACTERL is an acronym with each letter representing the first letter of one of the more common findings seen in affected individuals: (V) = vertebral abnormalities; (A) = anal atresia; (C) = cardiac (heart) defects; (T) = tracheal anomalies including tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula; (E) = esophageal atresia; (R) = renal (kidney) and radial (thumb side of hand) abnormalities; and (L) = other limb abnormalities. Other features may include (less frequently) growth deficiencies and failure to thrive; facial asymmetry (hemifacial microsomia); external ear malformations; intestinal malrotation; and genital anomalies. Intelligence is usually normal. The exact cause of VACTERL/VATER association is unknown; most cases occur randomly, for no apparent reason. In rare cases, VACTERL/VATER association has occurred in more than one family member."
"Summary of Fetal valproate spectrum disorder: Fetal valproate spectrum disorder may occur if a developing baby is exposed to valproic acid during pregnancy. Valproic acid, also known as valproate, is a medication that is often used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and migraines. Many babies who are exposed to this medication during pregnancy are born healthy with normal growth and development. However, studies have found that women who take valproate during pregnancy have a greater chance of having a baby with a major birth defect or other health problem. Symptoms of Fetal valproate spectrum disorder vary but may include characteristic facial features, spina bifida, congenital heart defects, cleft lip and/or cleft palate, genital abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, and developmental delay. A child exposed to valproic acid may be at a higher risk for learning and behavioral problems."
"Summary of Van den Bosch syndrome: A rare X-linked syndromic intellectual disability characterized by intellectual deficit, choroideremia, horizontal nystagmus, severe myopia, acrokeratosis verruciformis-like skin abnormality, anhidrosis, and scapular winging. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1959."
"Summary of Cerebrofacioarticular syndrome: Cerebro-facio-articular syndrome, which is also known as van Maldergem syndrome, is a condition that was first described in 1992. Key features of the condition include characteristic facial features, hand abnormalities, moderate to severe intellectual disability, poor muscle tone and joint hyperlaxity. Cerebro-facio-articular syndrome can be caused by changes in the DCHS1 or FAT4 genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens: Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) occurs in males when the tubes that carry sperm out of the testes (vas deferens) fail to develop properly. Although the testes usually develop and function normally, sperm cannot be transported through the vas deferens to become part of semen. As a result, men with this condition are unable to father children (infertile) unless they use assisted reproductive technologies. This condition has not been reported to affect sex drive or sexual performance. This condition can occur alone or as a sign of cystic fibrosis. Many men with CBAVD do not have the other characteristic features of cystic fibrosis; however, some men with this condition may experience mild respiratory or digestive problems."
Summary of Vasquez Hurst Sotos syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation: Vein of Galen aneurysm is a rare form of arteriovenous malformation in which the embryonic precursor to the vein of Galen, a vein at the base of the brain, dilates causing too much blood to rush to the heart. This can lead to rapid heart failure. Other features may include increased head circumference resulting from hydrocephalus, unusually prominent veins on the face and scalp, developmental delay, persistent headache, and other neurological findings. Vein of Galen aneurysm is often recognized on an ultrasound late in pregnancy. In other cases, it is diagnosed after birth. Although the exact cause remains unknown, this condition appears to result from a defect in early fetal development."
"Summary of Velo-facial-skeletal syndrome: A very rare multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphism (elongated face, hypertelorism, broad and high nasal bridge, mild epicanthus, posteriorly angulated ears, narrow and high-arched palate), skeletal anomalies (mesomelic brachymelia, short broad hands, prominent finger pads, short stubby thumbs, hyperextensibility of small joints, small feet), hypernasality and normal intelligence. Delayed bone age has also been reported."

"Summary of Ventricular fibrillation, idiopathic: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Congenitally uncorrected transposition of the great arteries: Congenitally uncorrected transposition of the great arteries (congenitally uncorrected TGA) is a heart problem that some people are born with. It means that the two main arteries in the heart are switched, which can cause problems with blood flow. This condition is also called complete transposition."

"Summary of Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus: Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (ILVEN) is a type of skin overgrowth, called epidermal nevus. It is characterized by skin colored, brown, or reddish, wart-like papules (nevi). The nevi join to form patches or plaques that often follow a pattern on the skin known as the ""lines of Blaschko"". The affected areas of the skin may be red, itchy, and inflamed. ILVEN typically presents from birth to early childhood and often is limited to one side of the lower half of the body. It affects females more often than males. It usually occurs alone; however, rarely ILVEN can be associated with other symptoms as part of an epidermal nevus syndrome. Rarely, ILVEN can become cancerous (for example, basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma). ILVEN is caused by a genetic change that occurs after conception (somatic genetic change). How this alteration leads to the signs and symptoms of ILVEN is not well understood."

WAGR is an acronym for Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary problems (such as undescended testicles or hypospadias in males, or internal genital or urinary anomalies in females), and Range of developmental delays. A combination of two or more of these conditions is usually present in most individuals with WAGR syndrome. The syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11. In most cases, this genetic change occurs spontaneously during early embryonic development (de novo) for unknown reasons (sporadic). Only rarely is the genetic change inherited."

"Summary of White matter hypoplasia-corpus callosum agenesis-intellectual disability syndrom: White matter hypoplasia-corpus callosum agenesis-intellectual disability syndrome is a neurological condition characterized by brain anomalies; an unusual face with broad nasal root, widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), and a very small chin (micrognathia); failure to thrive; severe intellectual disability; and lack of muscle tone (hypotonia). Exams of the brain showed poor development (hypoplasia) of the pale part of the brain known as white matter, and an absent or abnormal corpus callosum (nerve fibers joining the two hemispheres of the brain). The cause is unknown but may be related to a disorder of axonal development. The described cases seem to be inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked way. Corpus callosum agenesis is one of the more frequent congenital malformations. It can be either asymptomatic or associated with intellectual disability, epilepsy, or psychiatric syndromes. It can be part of several genetic syndromes, such as Aicardi syndrome, Andermann syndrome and Apert syndrome, trisomies 13, 18; or result from metabolic causes; drugs (cocaine); or viral infection (influenza). Many patients with corpus callosum anomalies have other brain anomalies, including white matter hypoplasia."

"Summary of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome: Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) includes distinctive facial features, growth delay, and intellectual disability. Signs and symptoms vary, but facial features may include thick eyebrows, wide-spaced eyes, and narrow eye openings. People with WSS may also have excessive hair on the elbows, arms, and back; difficulty feeding; behavior problems; and seizures. Because WSS has been reported in a small number of individuals, there is not much information on how the symptoms and features change over time. WSS is caused by genetic changes in the KMT2A gene. Most individuals with WSS are the only ones in their family with this condition. In a few cases, WSS has been inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and clinical exam, and it is confirmed by the results of genetic testing."

It is characterized by Klippel-Feil anomaly (in which the bones of the neck fuse together), Duane syndrome (an eye movement disorder), and hearing loss. Wildervanck syndrome occurs primarily in females. In most cases, Wildervanck syndrome occurs randomly for unknown reasons in a family with no prior history (sporadically), though a deletion on the X chromosome was identified in one individual with Wildervanck syndrome. X-linked dominant inheritance has been suggested due to the high prevalence of affected females."
"Summary of Acquired von Willebrand syndrome: Acquired Von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) is a bleeding disorder that can occur due to a variety of conditions, but is not caused by a VWF genetic change.

Infants with PWS have severe hypotonia (low muscle tone), feeding difficulties, and slow growth. Other signs and symptoms often include short stature, hypogonadism, developmental delays, cognitive impairment, and distinctive behavioral characteristics such as temper tantrums, stubbornness, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. PWS is caused by missing or non-working genes on chromosome 15. Most cases are not inherited and occur randomly. Rarely, a genetic change responsible for PWS can be inherited."
"Summary of Denys-Drash syndrome: Denys-Drash syndrome is a condition that affects the kidneys and genitalia. Kidney disease typically begins in the first few months of life. In addition, up to 90 percent of people with this condition develop a rare form of kidney cancer known as Wilms tumor. Males with Denys-Drash syndrome have gonadal dysgenesis, a condition in which the external genitalia do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia) or the genitalia appear to be completely female. The testes are also undescended, meaning that they remain in the pelvis, abdomen, or groin. Affected females usually have normal genitalia. For this reason, females with this condition may be diagnosed with isolated nephrotic syndrome. Denys-Drash syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the WT1 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, most cases result from new genetic changes in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."

Less common manifestations include arthropathy, myopathy and duodenal ulcer."
"Summary of Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a disorder characterized by abnormal storage of fats (lipids) in many areas of the body (lipid storage disease). People with this disorder cannot break down certain lipids effectively (such as cholesterol), so these fats form fatty yellow nodules called xanthomas, that accumulate in the body, especially in the brain and the tendons that attach muscle to bone, which is reflected in the condition name (cerebro- meaning brain and -tendinous referring to tendons). Symptoms may include diarrhea, clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts), tendon problems and progressive neurologic problems, such as epilepsy, movement disorders, impaired speech (dysarthria), loss of sensation in the arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), dementia, hallucinations, and depression. Other symptoms may include brittle bones that are prone to fracture (osteoporosis) and an increased risk of developing heart or lung failure because of lipid buildup. It is caused by genetic changes in the CYP27A1 gene."

"Summary of Alveolar soft tissue sarcoma: Alveolar soft tissue sarcoma is a rare, slow-growing soft tissue sarcoma. Although it has been described in a variety of locations, it most commonly develops on the lower extremities in adults and in the head and neck region of children. Alveolar soft tissue sarcoma generally presents as a soft, pain-less lump that is often not associated with any additional signs and symptoms. In many cases, the condition is not diagnosed until the affected person develops symptoms of metastasis to other sites such as the lungs, bones, central nervous system and/or liver. The underlying cause of Alveolar soft tissue sarcoma is poorly understood. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."

"Summary of Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is one of a group of disorders (collectively called congenital adrenal hyperplasia) that affect the adrenal glands. In this condition, the adrenal glands produce excess androgens (male sex hormones). This condition is caused by genetic changes in the CYP11B1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. There are two types, the classic form and the non-classic form. Females with the classic form have ambiguous external genitalia with normal internal reproductive organs. Males and females with the classic form have early development of their secondary sexual characteristics (precocious puberty). The early growth spurt can prevent growth later in adolescence and lead to short stature in adulthood. About two-thirds of individuals with the classic form have high blood pressure which develops in the first year of life. Females with the non-classic form of 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency have normal female genitalia. As affected females get older, they may develop excessive body hair growth and irregular menstruation. Males with the non-classic form do not typically have any signs or symptoms except for short stature. High blood pressure is not a feature of the non-classic form."
"Summary of 46,XY disorder of sex development due to 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3: 46,XY disorder of sex development due to 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency is an inherited condition that affects male sexual development.

In some cases, the external genitalia are ambiguous or appear male but are abnormal in size and/or appearance. During puberty, people with this condition typically go on to develop male secondary sex characteristics, such as increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice, and development of male pattern body hair. 46,XY disorder of sex development due to 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the HSD17B3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of 18 Hydroxylase deficiency: CMO type I deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the penultimate biochemical step of aldosterone biosynthesis, the 18-hydroxylation of corticosterone (B) to 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OHB). This enzymatic defect results in decreased aldosterone and salt-wasting. In CMO I deficiency, aldosterone is undetectable, whereas its immediate precursor, 18-OHB, is low or normal. These patients have an increased ratio of corticosterone to 18-OHB (Portrat-Doyen et al., 1998).The CYP11B2 gene product also catalyzes the final step in aldosterone biosynthesis: the 18-oxidation of 18-OHB to aldosterone. A   defect in that enzymatic step results in CMO type II deficiency (610600), an allelic disorder with an overlapping phenotype but distinct biochemical features. In CMO II deficiency, aldosterone can be low or normal, but at the expense of increased secretion of 18-OHB. These patients have a low ratio of corticosterone to 18-OHB (Portrat-Doyen et al., 1998)."
"Summary of D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria: D-2-alpha hydroxyglutaric aciduria is an inherited metabolic condition that is associated with progressive brain damage. Signs and symptoms of this condition include developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, and abnormalities in the largest part of the brain (the cerebrum), which controls many important functions such as muscle movement, speech, vision, thinking, emotion, and memory. D-2-alpha hydroxyglutaric aciduria is caused by changes in the D2HGDH gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria: 3-Hydroxyisobutyric aciduria is a rare metabolic condition in which the body is unable to breakdown certain amino acids (the building blocks of protein). This leads to a toxic buildup of particular acids known as organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), tissues and urine (organic aciduria). Signs and symptoms of 3-Hydroxyisobutyric aciduria include developmental delay, characteristic facial features and brain abnormalities. The exact underlying cause is not well understood. Some cases may be caused by changes in the ALDH6A1 gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 3: 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type III (MGA III) is an organic aciduria characterised by the association of optic atrophy and choreoathetosis with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.
"Summary of 3C syndrome: Cranio-cerebello-cardiac (3C) syndrome is a rare multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized by craniofacial (prominent occiput and forehead, hypertelorism, ocular coloboma, cleft palate), cerebellar (Dandy-Walker malformation, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia) and cardiac (tetralogy of Fallot, atrial and ventricular septal defects) anomalies (see these terms)."
"Summary of 3M syndrome: 3M syndrome is a growth disorder that causes short stature, characteristic facial features, and skeletal abnormalities. Intelligence is normal. The name comes from the initials of three researchers who first identified it: Miller, McKusick, and Malvaux. 3M syndrome is caused by genetic changes in one of three genes: CUL7, OBSL1, and CCDC8. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the presence of clinical features. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific gene involved."
"Summary of Hawkinsinuria: Hawkinsinuria is an inherited disorder, characterized by the inability to break down the amino acid tyrosine. This results in the finding of certain amino acids in the urine, such as hawkinsin. The features of this condition usually appear around the time infants are weaned off breast milk and begin to use formula. The signs and symptoms may include: failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), abnormally high acid levels in the blood (acidosis), and fine or sparse hair. Hawkinsinuria is caused by genetic changes in the HPD gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis: 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis is a condition where the ovaries don't develop properly. This can lead to premature ovarian failure in females who have a normal chromosome makeup. This can happen because the gonads don't develop or because they don't respond to hormones that stimulate their growth."
"Summary of Trisomy X: 47 XXX syndrome, also called trisomy X or triple X syndrome, is characterized by the presence of an additional (third) X chromosome in each of a female's cells (which normally have two X chromosomes). An extra copy of the X chromosome is associated with tall stature, learning problems, and other features in some girls and women. Seizures or kidney abnormalities occur in about 10 percent of affected females. 47 XXX syndrome is usually caused by a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction can result in reproductive cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes. Some females with 47 XXX syndrome have an extra X chromosome in only some of their cells; this is called 46,XX/47,XXX mosaicism."
"Summary of 47,XYY syndrome: 47, XYY syndrome is a syndrome (group of signs and symptoms) that affects males. For some males with this syndrome, signs and symptoms are barely noticeable. For others, signs and symptoms may include learning disabilities, speech delay, low muscle tone (hypotonia), and being taller than expected. 47, XYY syndrome is caused by having an extra copy of the Y chromosome in every cell of the body. The syndrome is usually not inherited. Diagnosis can be made based on prenatal tests, or it may occur during childhood or adulthood if a male has signs or symptoms of the disease."
"Summary of 48,XXXY syndrome: 48,XXXY syndrome is a type of chromosome abnormality characterized by the presence of 2 extra X chromosomes in males. It is sometimes referred to as a variant of Klinefelter syndrome, but differs from Klinefelter syndrome in many ways and is usually more severe. Signs and symptoms of 48,XXXY syndrome can vary but may include learning difficulties; intellectual disability; low muscle tone (hypotonia); hypogonadism; delayed growth; distinctive facial features; and a variety of birth defects that may affect the genital and musculoskeletal systems. Many also have poorly developed social skills and delayed language development. This condition is not inherited and likely results from a random error in cell division."
"Summary of 48,XXYY syndrome: 48,XXYY syndrome is a chromosomal condition, characterized by the presence of an extra X and Y chromosome in males, that causes medical and behavioral problems. 48,XXYY can be considered a variant of Klinefelter syndrome. Individuals with 48,XXYY are usually considerably tall with small testes that do not function normally leading to infertility. In addition, affected individuals have behavioral problems such as anxiety, aggressiveness, problems communicating, hyperactivity, depression, as well as general learning disabilities and intellectual impairment. Other medical probelms can include congenital heart defects, bone abnormalities, tremor, obesity, type 2 diabetes and/or respiratory problems."
"Summary of Pentasomy X: Pentasomy X is a sex chromosome anomaly caused by the presence of three extra X chromosomes in females (49,XXXXX instead of 46,XX)."
"Summary of 49,XXXXY syndrome: 49,XXXXY syndrome is a type of chromosome abnormality characterized by the presence of 3 extra X chromosomes in males. It is sometimes referred to as a variant of Klinefelter syndrome, but differs from Klinefelter syndrome in many ways and is more severe. Signs and symptoms of 49,XXXXY syndrome can vary but may include learning difficulties or intellectual disability; low muscle tone; hypogonadism; infertility; delayed growth; distinctive facial features; and a variety of birth defects that may affect the heart, bones, brain and/or kidneys. It is usually not inherited and caused by a random error in cell division."
"Summary of 46,XY disorder of sex development due to 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency: 46,XY disorder of sex development due to 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency is an inherited condition that primarily affects male sexual development before birth and during puberty. People with this condition are genetically male, with one X and one Y chromosome in each cell, and they have male gonads (testes). Their bodies, however, do not produce enough of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is critical for male sexual development. Most are born with external genitalia that appear female. In other cases, affected individuals may have ambiguous genitalia. Others may have genitalia that appear predominantly male, often with an unusually small penis (micropenis) and the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). This condition is caused by genetic changes in the SRD5A2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
Summary of 5-oxoprolinase deficiency: A very heterogeneous condition characterized by 5-oxoprolinuria.
"Summary of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase deficiency: 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency is one of the causes of malignant hyperphenylalaninemia due to tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. Not only does tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency cause hyperphenylalaninemia, it is also responsible for defective neurotransmission of monoamines because of malfunctioning tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, both tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent hydroxylases."
"Summary of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a rare genetic condition affecting multiple body systems. Signs and symptoms may include characteristic facial features, small head size, growth and developmental delays, and intellectual and behavioral problems. Individuals with SLOS have abnormally low levels of cholesterol in their blood and high levels of a chemical known as 7-dehydrocholestrol. The severity of symptoms varies from individual to individual. Many babies have feeding difficulties and growth issues. Some are born with heart, kidney, and adrenal problems. Most people with SLOS have some degree of intellectual and behavioral difficulties. This condition is caused by genetic changes (DNA variants) in the DHCR7 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This condition is diagnosed based on the features and laboratory and genetic testing."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency: Glycogen storage disease due to muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency is an inherited condition in which the body is unable to break down glycogen (a complex sugar) in the muscle cells. Because glycogen is an important source of energy, this can interfere with the normal functioning of muscle cells. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary, but may include muscle weakness and stiffness; painful muscle cramps; nausea and vomiting; and/or myoglobinuria (the presence of myoglobin in the urine) following moderate to strenuous exercise. Those who develop the condition during infancy may experience additional symptoms such as hypotonia (poor muscle tone), cardiomyopathy, and breathing difficulties. This condition is caused by changes in the PFKM gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Temtamy syndrome: Temtamy syndrome is a developmental neurological disorder, meaning that it affects the way the brain is formed and how well it functions. In most cases, the bundle of nerve fibers (the corpus callosum) that connects the two sides of the brain is partially or completely missing. Other symptoms may include seizures, changes in the size or function of the eyes, heart problems, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. Temtamy syndrome is caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants) in the C12ORf57 gene. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis is based on observing symptoms of the syndrome and the results of brain imaging. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Refsum disease: Refsum disease is an inherited condition that causes vision loss, loss of smell (anosmia), and a variety of other signs and symptoms. The vision loss associated with Refsum disease is caused by an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa. Other features can include bone abnormalities of the hands and feet; progressive muscle weakness and wasting; poor balance and coordination (ataxia); hearing loss; arrhythmias and heart abnormalities; and dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis). Refsum disease can result from genetic changes in the PHYH gene or the PEX7 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome: Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is a disorder of sex development that affects the growing reproductive and genital organs of a fetus. Androgen insensitivity refers to the inability of the body of an individual with a 46, XY karyotype (usually leading to normal male development) to properly respond to male sex hormones (androgens). In PAIS, the body partially responds to these hormones. Signs and symptoms of PAIS can vary greatly, causing a range of differences in genital appearance. Males may have hypospadias, small penis, and bifid scrotum. Females may have large clitoris, partial fusion of the labia, and gynecomastia (excessive development of male breasts). In the milder cases, the only symptom may be infertility. PAIS It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner and is caused by genetic changes in the AR gene."
"Summary of Reactive arthritis: Reactive arthritis is a type of infectious arthritis that occurs as a âreactionâ to an infection elsewhere in the body. This process may occur weeks or even months after the infection has resolved. In addition to joint inflammation, Reactive arthritis is associated with two other symptoms: redness and inflammation of the eyes (conjunctivitis) and inflammation of the urinary tract (urethritis). These symptoms may occur alone, together, or not at all. The exact cause of Reactive arthritis is unknown. It may follow an infection with Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, Shigella sonnei, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium, or Chlamydia trachomatis. Certain genes may make you more prone to the syndrome. For instance, the condition is observed more commonly in patients with human lymphocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) histocompatibility antigens."
"Summary of Retinitis pigmentosa: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited eye diseases that affect the light-sensitive part of the eye (retina). RP causes cells in the retina to die, causing progressive vision loss. The first sign of RP usually is night blindness. As the condition progresses, affected individuals develop tunnel vision (loss of peripheral vision), and eventually loss of central vision. RP may be caused by genetic changes in any of at least 50 genes. Inheritance can be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked."
"Summary of Retinopathy of prematurity: A rare retinal vasoproliferative disease affecting preterm infants characterized initially by a delay in physiologic retinal vascular development and compromised physiologic vascularity, and subsequently by aberrant angiogenesis in the form of intravitreal neovascularization."
"Summary of Rett syndrome: Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental condition that primarily affects girls. People with the disease appear to have normal psychomotor development during the first 6 to 18 months of life, followed by a developmental ""plateau,"" and then rapid regression in language and motor skills. Additional signs and symptoms may include repetitive, stereotypic hand movements; fits of screaming and inconsolable crying; autistic features; panic-like attacks; teeth grinding (bruxism); episodic apnea and/or hyperpnea; gait ataxia and apraxia; tremors; seizures; and slowed head growth. Some people have an atypical form of Rett syndrome that may be more mild or more severe. Classic Rett syndrome is most commonly caused by genetic changes in the MECP2 gene and is usually inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. The vast majority of cases are not inherited from a parent, but are due to a new genetic change in the affected person."
"Summary of Fibrosclerosis, multifocal: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lung condition that prevents enough oxygen from getting to the lungs and into the blood.  People who develop ARDS often are very ill with another disease or have major injuries. The condition leads to a buildup of fluid in the air sacs which prevents enough oxygen from passing into the bloodstream. Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, low blood pressure and organ failure, rapid breathing and shortness of breath."
"Summary of Rheumatic fever: Rheumatic Fever is an inflammatory condition that may develop after infection with group A Streptococcus bacteria, such as strep throat or scarlet fever. Early signs and symptoms include sore throat; swollen red tonsils; fever; headache; and/or muscle and joint aches. Some affected people develop rheumatic heart disease, which can lead to inflammation and scarring of the heart valves. It is not clear why some people who are infected with group A Streptococcus bacteria go on to develop Rheumatic Fever, while others do not; however, it appears that some families may have a genetic susceptibility to develop the condition."
"Summary of Rickets: Rickets is a condition that causes children to have soft, weak bones. It usually occurs when children do not get enough vitamin D, which helps growing bones absorb important nutrients. Vitamin D comes from sunlight and food. Skin produces vitamin D in response to the sun's rays. Some foods also contain vitamin D, including fortified dairy products and cereals, and some kinds of fish."
"Summary of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome: Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is a group of disorders that mainly affects the development of the eye. Common eye symptoms include cornea defects and iris defects. People with this syndrome may have an off-center pupil (corectopia) or extra holes in the eyes that can look like multiple pupils (polycoria). About 50% of people with this syndrome develop glaucoma, a condition that increases pressure inside of the eye, and may cause vision loss or blindness. Even though Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is primarily an eye disorder, this syndrome can affect other parts of the body. Most people with this syndrome have distinctive facial features and many have issues with their teeth, including unusually small teeth (microdontia) or fewer than normal teeth (oligodontia). Some people have extra folds of skin around their belly button, heart defects, or other more rare birth defects. Several genes have been associated with the disease.  Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
Summary of Aberrant subclavian artery: Aberrant subclavian artery is a rare vascular anomaly that is present from birth. It usually causes no symptoms and is often discovered as an incidental finding (such as through a barium swallow or echocardiogram). Occasionally the anomaly causes swallowing difficulty (dysphagia lusoria). Swallowing symptoms in children may present as feeding difficulty and/or recurrent respiratory tract infection. Children with symptomatic Aberrant subclavian artery should be carefully evaluated for additional vascular and heart anomalies.
"Summary of Idiopathic achalasia: Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It is characterized by enlargement of the esophagus, impaired ability of the esophagus to push food down toward the stomach (peristalsis), and failure of the ring-shaped muscle at the bottom of the esophagus (the lower esophageal sphincter) to relax. The exact etiology is unknown, however, symptoms are caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus. Familial studies have shown evidence of a potential genetic influence. When a genetic influence is suspected, achalasia is called familial esophageal achalasia."
Summary of Achard Thiers syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to acid maltase deficiency: Glycogen storage disease due to acid maltase deficiency, is an inherited metabolic disorder. Muscle weakness is usually the main symptom. Glycogen storage disease due to acid maltase deficiency is caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants) in the GAA gene which have instructions to produce the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase), needed to break down glycogen, a substance that is a source of energy for the body. The enzyme deficiency results in the accumulation of glycogen inside lysosomes, structures within cells that break down waste products within the cell. Accumulation of glycogen in certain tissues, especially muscles, impairs their function."
Summary of Acquired agranulocytosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Acrocallosal syndrome: A rare polymalformative syndrome characterized by agenesis of corpus callosum (CC), distal anomalies of limbs, minor craniofacial anomalies and intellectual disability."
"Summary of Acrodermatitis: An inflammatory skin condition affecting children. It is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, hepatitis B infection or cytomegalovirus infection. It is characterized by the presence of cutaneous rashes and patches on the palms and soles. The trunk is not affected."
Summary of Acrodermatitis enteropathica: Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) is a disorder of zinc metabolism that can either be inherited or acquired. Both forms lead to the inability to absorb zinc from the intestine. The lack of zinc can cause skin inflammation with a rash (pustular dermatitis) around the mouth and/or anus; diarrhea; and abnormal nails (nail dystrophy). Irritability and emotional disturbances can also occur. The inherited form is caused by genetic changes in the SLC39A4 gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The acquired form can result from diets lacking the appropriate amount of zinc.
"Summary of Acrodysostosis: Acrodysostosis refers to a group of genetic disorders of bone growth. Common signs and symptoms include very short fingers and toes, underdeveloped facial bones, a small nose, and short stature. Many individuals with Acrodysostosis have developmental delays and intellectual disability. Individuals with Acrodysostosis additionally may have hormone resistance, which means that the body does not respond to the certain hormones. The disease may be caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants) in one of two genes, PRKAR1A or PDE4D.  The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with most reported cases occurring for the first time in a family due to a new genetic change."
"Summary of Acromegaly: Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that results from the pituitary gland producing too much growth hormone (GH). It is most often diagnosed in middle-aged adults, although symptoms can appear at any age. Signs and symptoms include abnormal growth and swelling of the hands and feet; bone changes that; alter various facial features; arthritis; carpal tunnel syndrome; enlargement of body organs; and various other symptoms. The condition is usually caused by benign tumors on the pituitary called adenomas. Rarely, it is caused by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and other parts of the brain stimulating the pituitary gland to produce GH. When GH-producing tumors occur in childhood, the disease that results is called gigantism rather than Acromegaly. Acromegaly may also be part of other genetic syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1 and type 4, hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome, McCune-Allright syndrome, neurofibromatosis or Carney complex."
Summary of Acrospiroma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Congenital isolated ACTH deficiency: A rare endocrine disease characterized by neonatal hypoglycemia, prolonged cholestatic jaundice, and seizures. Typical are low plasma ACTH and cortisol levels in the absence of structural pituitary defects, and sometimes low partial growth hormone deficiency is associated."
"Summary of Actinomycosis: Actinomycosis is a bacterial infection that occurs most often in the face and neck. Symptoms of Actinomycosis include a neck mass, jaw or face pain, and formation of pockets of pus (abscess). When Actinomycosis occurs in other parts of the body, symptoms can include cough, chest or stomach pain, fever, and weight loss. It is usually caused by bacteria called Actinomyces israelii. These bacteria are found normally in the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract, and do not cause an infection unless there is a break in the skin or mucosa. The infection is not contagious. Actinomycosis is diagnosed based on the history and clinical exam, and through specific laboratory tests."
Summary of Acute mountain sickness: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Acute intermittent porphyria: Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is one of the liver (hepatic) porphyrias. AIP is caused by low levels of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), an enzyme also often called hydroxymethylbilane synthase. The low levels of PBGD are generally not sufficient to cause symptoms; however, activating factors such as hormones, drugs, and dietary changes may trigger symptoms. Although most individuals with AIP never develop symptoms, symptomatic individuals typically present with abdominal pain with nausea."
"Summary of Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis: A bacterial infectious process affecting the gums. It is characterized by the development of necrotic, ulcerated, and painful lesions with creation of pseudomembranes extending along the gingival margins."
"Summary of Adams-Oliver syndrome: Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is a rare disease characterized by an abnormality of skin development (areas of missing skin on the scalp called aplasia cutis congenita) and malformations of the hands and feet (terminal transverse limbs defects). The aplasia cutis may involve only the skin or include the skull under the skin. The terminal transverse limb defects may include webbed fingers or toes (syndactyly) and short or missing fingers or toes (brachydactyly or oligodactyly, respectively). Other signs and symptoms may include additional skeletal abnormalities of the limbs; cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (a blood vessel disorder); pulmonary hypertension; heart defects; and neurological problems. Severity can vary greatly among people with the syndrome and may be lethal in some cases. AOS is caused by genetic changes in any of six known genes. It may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner, depending on the genetic cause. In some cases, the genetic cause is unknown."
"Summary of Addison disease: Addison's disease occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough (or any) of the hormones, cortisol and aldosterone. These adrenal gland hormones are necessary for balancing water and energy in the body. Symptoms usually develop slowly over time, and may include fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and dark patches of skin. Sometimes symptoms occur suddenly causing a condition called acute adrenal failure, also known as an acute adrenal crisis. Symptoms of an acute adrenal crisis include sudden weakness, pain, and fainting. The most common cause of Addison's disease is an abnormal response of the body's immune system. Injury to the adrenal gland can also cause Addison's disease. Diagnosis is based on the the symptoms, blood and urine tests that evaluate adrenal function, and imaging studies."
Summary of Adenocarcinoid tumor: A malignant epithelial neoplasm composed of a mixture of neuroendocrine cells with morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of carcinoid tumor and malignant glandular cells.
"Summary of Lung adenocarcinoma: Lung adenocarcinoma is a cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in the lungs. It is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer that is often diagnosed in an outer area of the lung. Early lung cancers may not be associated with any signs and symptoms. As the condition progresses, affected people can experience chest pain, a persistent cough, fatigue, coughing up blood, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, shortness of breath, and/or wheezing."
"Summary of Adenoid cystic carcinoma: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare form of adenocarcinoma, a type of cancer that begins in glandular tissues. It most commonly arises in the major and minor salivary glands of the head and neck. It can also occur in the breast, uterus, or other locations in the body. Symptoms depend on the tumor's location. Salivary gland tumors may cause painless masses in the mouth or face. Tumors of the lacrimal gland may cause a bulging eye or changes in vision. Those affecting the windpipe or voice box may cause respiratory symptoms or changes in speech, respectively. Advanced tumors may cause pain and/or nerve paralysis, as ACC often spreads along the nerves. It may also spread through the bloodstream. It spreads to the lymph nodes in about 5% to 10% of cases. The cause of ACC is currently unknown. It typically does not run in families."
"Summary of Adenoma of the adrenal gland: ""Adenomas of the adrenal gland are non-cancerous (benign) tumors on the adrenal gland. Most do not cause any signs or symptoms. However, some may become """"active"""" or """"functioning"""" which means they produce hormones, often in excess of what the adrenal glands typically produce. High levels of these hormones may lead to complications, including primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome and other medical conditions."""
"Summary of Ameloblastoma: Ameloblastoma is a rare, noncancerous (benign) tumor that typically develops in the jaw near the molars. It originates in the cells that form the enamel that protects your teeth. The condition most often occurs in adults in their 30s and 40s, though it can occur at any age. In many cases, the first sign is painless swelling in the jaw. These tumors are rarely found outside of the jaw."
"Summary of Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency: Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency is an inherited condition that damages the immune system and is a common cause of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). People with SCID due to Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency are unable to fight off most types of infections, including bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Most people with Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency develop symptoms before 6 months of age. The earliest symptoms of Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency may include pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, widespread skin rashes, slowed growth, and/or developmental delay. Some people with ADA deficiency may develop symptoms later in life. Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the ADA gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis may be suspected by newborn screening or symptoms and confirmed by blood and genetic test results."
"Summary of Holmes-Adie syndrome: Holmes-Adie syndrome is is a neurological disorder affecting the pupil of the eye and the autonomic nervous system. It is characterized by one eye with a pupil that is larger than normal that constricts slowly in bright light (tonic pupil), along with the absence of deep tendon reflexes, usually in the Achilles tendon. In most cases, the cause of Holmes-Adie syndrome is unknown. Some cases may result from trauma, surgery, lack of blood flow, or infection.  When only the pupil is affected, the disorder may be referred to as Adie's pupil."
"Summary of Adiposis dolorosa: Adiposis dolorosa is a condition characterized by the growth of multiple, painful, lipomas (benign, fatty tumors). The lipomas may occur anywhere on the body and can cause severe pain. Other symptoms may include weakness, fatigue, and memory disturbances. It usually occurs in adults, and women are more commonly affected than men. The exact cause is unknown. Most cases are sporadic (not inherited) but a few familial cases with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported."
"Summary of Adrenal cancer: Adrenal cancer is a rare form of cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in the adrenal glands (small glands that sit above each kidney). In most cases, the underlying cause of the condition is unknown. However, certain genetic conditions such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, neurofibromatosis type I, and Carney complex are associated with an increased risk of developing adrenal tumors and cancer."
Summary of Adrenal medulla cancer: A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm affecting the adrenal medulla.
"Summary of 21-hydroxylase deficiency: 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is a group of disorders that affect how the adrenal glands work. In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, a missing enzyme leads to overproduction of specific hormones made by the adrenal glands. There are three types of 21-hydroxylase deficiency that vary by the severity of symptoms. Infants with the more severe forms can experience excessive loss of salt in their urine, which can be serious. Female infants may be born with genitalia that doesn't look male or female (ambiguous genitalia). Children with the less severe forms can have early puberty, excess hair growth, short stature as adults and decreased fertility. 21-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the CYP21A2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Newborn screening is available in all 50 states of the US to test for this disorder at birth. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical symptoms, biochemical and genetic testing."
"Summary of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a genetic disease that affects the brain and the adrenal glands (small glands located on top of each kidney). It is caused by variations in the ABCD1 gene that lead to an inability to break down very longâchain fatty acids (VLCFAs) which can accumulate in the brain and adrenal glands. This can result in progressive loss of the fatty covering (myelin) that surrounds the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. In addition, damage to the adrenal glands can lead to a reduction in certain hormones. This disease is inherited in an X-linked manner."
"Summary of Familial afibrinogenemia: Afibrinogenemia, sometimes called congenital Afibrinogenemia, is an inherited blood disorder in which the blood does not clot normally. It occurs when there is a lack (deficiency) of a protein called fibrinogen (or coagulation factor I), which is needed for the blood to clot. Affected individuals may be susceptible to severe bleeding (hemorrhaging) episodes, particularly during infancy and childhood. Afibrinogenemia is thought to be transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait."
Summary of Ahumada Del Castillo syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Aicardi syndrome: Aicardi syndrome is a neurological disorder. The severity of the syndrome and the associated signs and symptoms vary from person to person. The three main features of Aicardi syndrome are: Complete or partial absence of the nerve tissue that allows the right and left sides of the brain to communicate (corpus callosum) , seizures beginning in infancy (infantile spasms), that may become hard to control (refractory epilepsy) , and defects or holes in the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina) known as chorioretinal lacunae  Other signs and symptoms may include: Developmental delay, Intellectual disability that ranges from very mild to severe,  Characteristic facial features,  Other brain malformations such as a very small head (microcephaly) , and Other eye defects The cause of Aicardi syndrome is currently unknown. Because the syndrome almost only affects females, it is believed to be caused by a change in a gene located on the X-chromosome and inherited in a dominant X-linked manner. However, most cases are de novo, which means the genetic change happened by mistake during the making of the egg or the sperm and there are no other cases of the syndrome in the family. Speech is usually very limited, while other abilities and disabilities vary greatly. In cases of severe epilepsy and/or if there are serious brain or eye defects, the intellectual disabilities tend to be more severe."

"Summary of Albinism: Albinism is a group of inherited disorders that results in little or no production of the pigment melanin, which determines the color of the skin, hair and eyes. Melanin also plays a role in the development of certain optical nerves, so all forms of Albinism cause problems with the development and function of the eyes. Other symptoms can include light skin or changes in skin color; very white to brown hair; very light blue to brown eye color that may appear red in some light and may change with age; sensitivity to sun exposure; and increased risk of developing skin cancer. Albinism is caused by genetic changes in one of several genes, and most types are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Pseudohypoparathyroidism with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy: Pseudohypoparathyroidism with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, also known as Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), is a rare disorder with a wide range of signs and symptoms, including short stature, obesity, round face, subcutaneous ossifications (formation of bone under the skin), and short fingers and toes (brachydactyly). When the disorder is inherited from the mother, the features of AHO can be associated with resistance to certain hormones, in particular the parathyroid hormone (PTH). This is called pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP1a). When inherited from the father, an individual will have AHO without any hormone issues, which is called pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP). This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner due to a genetic change in the GNAS gene."
"Summary of Alexander disease: Alexander disease is a type of leukodystrophy characterized by the destruction of the myelin sheath (the fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fiber) and abnormal protein deposits known as Rosenthal fibers. Symptoms of the infantile form include an enlarged brain and head, seizures, stiffness in the arms and/or legs, intellectual disability, and delayed physical development. Common problems in juvenile and adult forms of Alexander disease include speech abnormalities, swallowing difficulties, and poor coordination. Alexander disease is caused by genetic changes in the GFAP gene. While this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, most cases result from new genetic changes in the gene."
"Summary of Alkaptonuria: Alkaptonuria is an inherited condition that causes urine to turn black when exposed to air. The three major features of Alkaptonuria are the presence of dark urine, ochronosis, a buildup of dark pigment in connective tissues such as cartilage and skin, and arthritis of the spine and larger joints. Other features of this condition can include heart problems, kidney stones, and prostate stones. Alkaptonuria is caused by genetic changes in the HGD gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
Summary of Allergic angiitis: An autoimmune necrotizing vasculitis with the formation of granulomas. It is a pulmonary and systemic vasculitis associated with eosinophilia.
Summary of Allergic encephalomyelitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Alopecia areata: Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles. In most cases, hair falls out in small, round patches on the scalp. Although uncommon, hair loss can be more extensive in some people and affect other parts of the body. Although the exact cause of AA is unknown, roughly 20% of affected people have a family member with alopecia, suggesting that genetic factors may contribute to the development of the condition."
"Summary of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome: Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is a neurologic disorder. Symptoms include increased muscle tone with exaggerated reflexes (spasticity), seizures, and loss of cognitive ability (dementia).  Most often Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the POLG gene."
"Summary of Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited disease that causes an increased risk of having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver disease, skin problems (panniculitis), and inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis). Lung (pulmonary) problems almost always occur in adults, whereas liver and skin problems may occur in adults and children. Symptoms may include shortness of breath and wheezing, repeated infections of the lungs and liver, yellow skin, feeling overly tired (fatigue), rapid heartbeat when standing, vision problems, and weight loss. However, some people with AATD do not have any problems. AATD is caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants) in the SERPINA1 gene and is inherited in a codominant manner. The genetic changes cause too little or no working alpha-1 antitrypsin protein (AAT) to be made. AAT is made in the liver cells and sent through the bloodstream to the lungs where it helps protect the lungs from damage. Having low levels of AAT (or no AAT) may lead the lungs to become damaged. A build-up of abnormal AAT may cause liver damage. Diagnosis may be suspected by finding low levels of AAT in the blood and confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Alport syndrome: Alport syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. Most affected individuals experience progressive loss of kidney function, which may lead to end-stage kidney disease. People with Alport syndrome also frequently develop sensorineural hearing loss in late childhood or early adolescence. The eye abnormalities characteristic of this condition seldom lead to vision loss. In 80% of cases, Alport syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner and is caused by genetic changes in the COL4A5 gene. In the remaining cases, it may be inherited in either an autosomal recessive, or rarely in an autosomal dominant manner. In these cases, the condition is caused by genetic changes in the COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes. Diagnosis of the condition is based on family history of the condition, clinical signs, and specific testing such as a kidney biopsy. The diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also referred to as ""Lou Gehrig's disease,"" is a motor neuron disease which leads to problems with muscle control and movement. There are various types of ALS that are distinguished by symptoms and, in some cases, genetic cause. Early symptoms may include muscle twitching, cramping, stiffness, or weakness, slurred speech, and/or difficulty chewing or swallowing. As the disease progresses, people may become weaker and are eventually wheelchair-dependent. Most people with ALS have a sporadic (not inherited) form of ALS. It is believed that these cases are caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. This means that a person may have inherited genetic changes (pathogenic variants) that increase their risk to develop ALS, but the person will only develop ALS if exposed to certain environmental triggers. About 10% of the people with ALS have at least one relative with the disease and are said to have have a familial (inherited) form of the disease (FALS). Familial ALS may be caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants) in any one of several genes and the pattern of inheritance varies depending on the gene involved. The distinction between sporadic and familial cases is not always clear. Diagnosis of ALS is based on symptoms and a variety of tests to rule out other possible medical diseases that can cause similar symptoms."
"Summary of Alström syndrome: Alstrom syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects many body systems. Symptoms develop gradually and can be variable. In childhood, the disorder is generally characterized by vision and hearing abnormalities, childhood obesity, and heart disease (cardiomyopathy). Over time, diabetes mellitus, liver problems, and kidney dysfunction may develop. Alstrom syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the ALMS1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Amelogenesis imperfecta: Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) (amelogenesis - enamel formation; imperfecta - imperfect) is a disorder that affects the structure and appearance of the enamel of the teeth. This condition causes teeth to be very small, discolored, pitted or grooved, and prone to rapid wear and breakage with early tooth decay and loss. These dental problems, which vary among affected individuals, can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. People with this disease my also have problems involving the tissues surrounding teeth (periodontal tissues) such as gums, cementum, ligaments, and alveolar bones in which the tooth root rests. Teeth are also sensitive to either hot or cold exposures, and sometimes both. Severe and continuous pain due to exposed dentin resulting from the enamel defect is present in some cases. AI can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive pattern."
Summary of Aminoaciduria: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of AL amyloidosis: AL amyloidosis the most common form of amyloidosis, a group of disorders in which an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in tissues and organs. The signs and symptoms of AL amyloidosis vary among patients because the build up may occur in the tongue, intestines, muscles, joints, nerves, skin, ligaments, heart, liver, spleen, or kidneys. To diagnose AL amyloidosis, healthcare professionals use blood or urine tests to identify signs of amyloid protein and a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis."
Summary of Amyotonia congenita: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Otopalatodigital syndrome type 2: A severe form of otopalatodigital syndrome spectrum disorder, and is characterized by dysmorphic facies, severe skeletal dysplasia affecting the axial and appendicular skeleton, extraskeletal anomalies (including malformations of the brain, heart, genitourinary system, and intestine) and poor survival."
"Summary of Androgen insensitivity syndrome: Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. People with this condition are genetically male, with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell. Because their bodies are unable to respond to certain male sex hormones (called androgens), they may have some physical traits of a woman. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the AR gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern."
"Summary of Isolated anencephaly/exencephaly: Isolated anencephaly/exencephaly is a type of neural tube defect characterized by abnormal development of the brain and the bones of the skull. The neural tube is a narrow channel that normally folds and closes between the 3rd and 4th weeks of pregnancy, forming the brain and spinal cord of the embryo. Isolated anencephaly/exencephaly occurs when the 'cephalic' or head end of the neural tube fails to close, causing the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp. Infants with this disorder are born without a forebrain (the front part of the brain) and a cerebrum (the thinking and coordinating part of the brain). The remaining brain tissue is often exposed (not covered by bone or skin). Affected babies are usually blind, deaf, unconscious, and unable to feel pain. Almost all babies with Isolated anencephaly/exencephaly die before birth, although some may survive a few hours or a few days after birth. Isolated anencephaly/exencephaly is likely caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors, many of which remain unknown."
"Summary of Angelman syndrome: Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Characteristic features of this condition include developmental delay, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, problems with movement and balance (ataxia), epilepsy, and a small head size. Individuals with Angelman syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. Many of the characteristic features of Angelman syndrome result from the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A. Most cases of Angelman syndrome are not inherited, although in rare cases a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited from a parent."
Summary of Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Angiosarcoma of the liver: A malignant vascular neoplasm arising from the liver.
Summary of Angiosarcoma of the scalp: Angiosarcoma of the scalp is a cancer which most commonly affects the elderly. Symptoms of this condition begin with a bruise-like lesions that progresses to an open or bleeding wound. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms and through a biopsy of the affected area of the scalp.
"Summary of Isolated aniridia: Aniridia is an eye disorder characterized by a complete or partial absence of the colored part of the eye (the iris) and is usually associated with foveal hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision). This combination can lead to decreased visual acuity and involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) in affected infants. People with Aniridia may also have other eye problems including increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma), clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts), and abnormalities of the cornea.  Many of these eye problems contribute to progressive vision loss in affected individuals. Occasionally, people with Aniridia have behavioral problems, developmental delay, and problems detecting odors. Aniridia may occur either as an isolated eye abnormality or as part of the Wilms tumor-Aniridia-genital anomalies-retardation (WAGR) syndrome. Isolated Aniridia may be caused by genetic changes in the PAX6 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
"Summary of Anodontia: Anodontia is a dental condition characterized by complete absence of teeth. The primary (baby) or permanent (adult) teeth may be involved. In most cases, the condition is associated with a group of conditions called the ectodermal dysplasias. In these cases, abnormalities are also noted in the hair, nails, and sweat glands. Anodontia is an autosomal recessive condition."
"Summary of Testicular agenesis: A rare 46,XY disorder of gonadal development characterized by congenital complete absence of testicular tissue in an individual with an otherwise normal male phenotype and normal karyotype. In addition, a small penis is a frequent finding in anorchid patients. Typical hormonal characteristics are elevated basal levels of gonadotropins (especially FSH), low concentration of testosterone, and lack of increase of plasma testosterone in response to hCG administration. The GnRH stimulation test induces a prolonged increase in FSH and LH levels."
"Summary of Antiphospholipid syndrome: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder. Signs and symptoms vary, but may include blood clots, miscarriage, rash, chronic headaches, dementia, and seizures. APS occurs when your body's immune system makes antibodies that attack phospholipids. Phospholipids are a type of fat found in all living cells, including blood cells and the lining of blood vessels. Most cases of APS occur in people with no family history of the disorder, however there are rare cases of APS clustering in a family. A widely accepted explanation for APS is that it is caused by a combination of genetic changes (making one more susceptible to APS) and an environmental exposure (such as to a virus)."
"Summary of Antley-Bixler syndrome: Antley Bixler syndrome is a rare condition that is primarily characterized by craniofacial abnormalities and other skeletal problems. The signs and symptoms vary significantly from person to person but may include craniosynostosis; midface hypoplasia (underdeveloped middle region of the face); frontal bossing; protruding eyes; low-set, unusually-formed ears; choanal atresia or stenosis (narrowing); fusion of adjacent arm bones (synostosis); joint contractures; arachnodactyly; bowing of the thigh bones; and/or urogenital (urinary tract and genital) abnormalities. The exact underlying cause of Antley Bixler syndrome is unknown in many cases; however, some are due to changes in the FGFR2 gene or the POR gene. There appear to be autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of the condition."
Summary of Aorta coarctation: A birth defect characterized by the narrowing of the AORTA that can be of varying degree and at any point from the transverse arch to the iliac bifurcation. Aortic coarctation causes arterial HYPERTENSION before the point of narrowing and arterial HYPOTENSION beyond the narrowed portion.
"Summary of Aortic valve stenosis: Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a condition characterized by narrowing of the heart's aortic valve opening. This narrowing prevents the valve from opening fully, which obstructs blood flow from the heart into the aorta, and onward to the rest of the body. AVS can range from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms typically develop when the narrowing of the opening is severe and may include chest pain (angina) or tightness; shortness of breath or fatigue (especially during exertion); feeling faint or fainting; heart palpitations; and heart murmur. Individuals with less severe congenital AVS (present at birth) may not develop symptoms until adulthood. Individuals with severe cases may faint without warning. AVS can have several causes including abnormal development before birth (such as having 1 or 2 valve leaflets instead of 3); calcium build-up on the valve in adulthood; and rheumatic fever."
"Summary of Apert syndrome: Apert syndrome is characterized by fusion of the skull bones too early during development (craniosynostosis) and webbing of fingers and toes (syndactyly). Other signs and symptoms may include distinctive facial features, some of which may lead to dental and vision problems. People with Apert syndrome may also have mild to moderate intellectual disability. Apert syndrome is caused by a change in the FGFR2 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but many cases result from a new genetic change in a person with no family history of the disorder (a de novo genetic change)."
Summary of Aphthous stomatitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Aplasia cutis congenita: Aplasia cutis congenita is a condition in which there is congenital (present from birth) absence of skin, with or without the absence of underlying structures such as bone. It most commonly affects the scalp, but any location of the body can be affected. While most people with Aplasia cutis congenita have no other abnormalities, some people have congenital malformations involving the cardiovascular (heart), gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and central nervous systems. The cause of this condition is unclear and appears to be multifactorial (many different factors appear to play a role); contributing factors may include teratogens, genes, trauma, and compromised blood flow to the skin."
"Summary of Apraxia: Apraxia is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to perform tasks or movements, despite having the desire and physical ability to perform them. It is caused by damage to the brain, especially the parietal lobe, and can arise from many diseases, tumors, a stroke, or traumatic brain injury. In some cases it is present from birth. There are several types of Apraxia, which may occur alone or together. Symptoms vary despednign on type."
"Summary of Arachnoiditis: Arachnoiditis is a pain disorder caused by inflammation of the arachnoid, one of the membranes that surrounds and protects the nerves of the spinal cord. The inflammation may occur due to irritation from chemicals; infection; direct injury to the spine; chronic compression of spinal nerves; or complications from spinal surgery or other spinal procedures. It may result in scar tissue and adhesions, which cause the spinal nerves to 'stick' together. If Arachnoiditis affects the function of nerves, it can cause symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and a characteristic stinging and burning pain in the lower back or legs. In some people, it may affect the bladder, bowel, and sexual function. Very severe Arachnoiditis can result in paralysis of the legs."
"Summary of Argininemia: Argininemia is an inherited metabolic disease in which the body is unable to process arginine (a building block of protein). It belongs to a group of disorders known as urea cycle disorders. These occur when the body's process for removing ammonia is disrupted, which can cause ammonia levels in the blood to rise (hyperammonemia). Symptoms may include feeding problems, vomiting, poor growth, seizures, and stiff muscles with increased reflexes (spasticity). People with Argininemia may also have developmental delay, loss of developmental milestones, and intellectual disability. Argininemia is caused by genetic changes in the ARG1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. People with Argininemia may be placed on a very low-protein diet with the help of a registered metabolic dietitian."
"Summary of Argininosuccinic aciduria: Argininosuccinic aciduria is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia. Argininosuccinic aciduria usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. An infant with Argininosuccinic aciduria may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have poorly controlled breathing rate or body temperature. Some babies with this disorder experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Complications from Argininosuccinic aciduria may include developmental delay, intellectual disability, progressive liver damage, skin lesions, and brittle hair. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the ASL gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
Summary of Chiari malformation: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart condition in which the muscle of the right ventricle of the heart is replaced by fat and/or scar tissue. The condition often leads to the right ventricle losing the ability to pump blood. Individuals with ARVC often develop abnormal heart rhythms known as arrhythmias. Other symptoms of ARVC include chest palpitations, dizziness, fainting and shortness of breath. ARVC is caused by genetic changes in genes that instruct proteins to link one heart cell to the next. There is also some evidence that ARVC could be caused by an infection of the heart muscle."
"Summary of Asbestos intoxication: A rare pneumoconiosis caused by exposure to asbestos particles. Symptoms may appear many years after exposure and include progressive dyspnea on exertion, dry cough, chest pain, tightness, inspiratory crackles, clubbing of the fingers. Later complications include mesothelioma and lung cancers."
"Summary of Asherman syndrome: A rare, acquired uterine disease characterized by intrauterine adhesions associated with a history of curettage or intrauterine surgery and gynecological symptoms (secondary amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, pelvic pain, infertility or pregnancy loss)."
"Summary of Aspartylglucosaminuria: Aspartylglycosaminuria is a rare lysosomal storage disease that causes a decline in mental functioning. Major symptoms may include coarse facial features, spine and eye deformities, behavior problems, and intellectual disability. Symptoms result from a deficiency in an enzyme called aspartylglycosaminidase, which leads to an accumulation of a protein called glycoasparagine in the body tissues and increased excretion of this protein in the urine. Aspartylglycosaminuria is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and caused by genetic changes in the AGA gene."
"Summary of Asperger syndrome: Asperger syndrome is part of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a group of disorders that affects the development of social and communication skills. Unlike many children with ASD, children with Asperger syndrome do not have early language delays, and often have well developed language skills and normal to above average intelligence. However, they may use unusual speech patterns and have a hard time understanding irony, humor, and sarcasm or gestures and social cues important to normal conversation. Many children with Asperger syndrome develop an obsessive interest in one topic or object. They may use high-level vocabulary or complex statistics in conversation. Children with Asperger syndrome may have delayed motor skills and thus can appear uncoordinated and clumsy compared to their peers. Other features of Asperger syndrome include difficulty interacting with peers, inappropriate social or emotional behavior, and engaging in repetitive routines. Both children and adults with Asperger syndrome are at an increased risk for depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mood and anxiety disorders, and other mental health disorders. The cause of Asperger syndrome, like most ASDs, is not fully understood, but there is a strong genetic basis, which means it does tend to run in families. Multiple environmental factors are also thought to play an important role in the development of all ASDs. Many people with Asperger syndrome can learn strategies to manage their symptoms."
"Summary of Aspergillosis: Aspergillosis is an infection, growth, or allergic response caused by the Aspergillus fungus. There are several different kinds of Aspergillosis. One kind is allergic bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (also called ABPA), a condition where the fungus causes allergic respiratory symptoms similar to asthma, such as wheezing and coughing, but does not actually invade and destroy tissue. Another kind of Aspergillosis is invasive Aspergillosis. This infection usually affects people with weakened immune systems due to cancer, AIDS, leukemia, organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or other conditions or events that reduce the number of normal white blood cells. In this condition, the fungus invades and damages tissues in the body. Invasive Aspergillosis most commonly affects the lungs, but can also cause infection in many other organs and can spread throughout the body (commonly affecting the kidneys and brain). Aspergilloma, a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of previous lung disease such as tuberculosis or lung abscess, is a third kind of Aspergillosis. This type of Aspergillosis is composed of a tangled mass of fungus fibers, blood clots, and white blood cells. The fungus ball gradually enlarges, destroying lung tissue in the process, but usually does not spread to other areas."
Summary of Asphyxia neonatorum: Respiratory failure in the newborn.
"Summary of Anaplastic astrocytoma: Anaplastic astrocytoma is a rare, cancerous (malignant) type of brain tumor that arises from star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes. These cells surround and protect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the location and size of the tumor and may include headaches, drowsiness, vomiting, and changes in personality or mental status. Some affected people have seizures, vision problems, weakness of the limbs, and/or coordination problems. Anaplastic astroctyomas usually occur sporadically but can be associated with a few rare, genetic disorders."
"Summary of Ataxia-telangiectasia: Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is rare condition that affects the nervous system, the immune system, and many other parts of the body. The condition is typically characterized by cerebellar ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), oculomotor apraxia, telangiectasias, choreoathetosis (uncontrollable movements of the limbs), a weakened immune system with frequent infections, and an increased risk of cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. A-T is caused by changes  in the ATM gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Athetosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Alpha-thalassemia-X-linked intellectual disability syndrome: Alpha-thalassemia x-linked intellectual disability (ATRX) syndrome is a genetic condition that causes intellectual disability, muscle weakness (hypotonia), short height, a particular facial appearance, genital abnormalities, and possibly other symptoms. It is caused by genetic changes in the ATRX gene and is inherited in an x-linked way."
"Summary of Atrial septal defect, ostium secundum type: An Ostium secundum atrial septal defect is a type of congenital heart defect called an atrial septal defect (ASD). An ASD is a hole in the wall (septum) between the two upper chambers of the heart (the atria). ASDs can be classified by location. An ostium secundum ASD is a hole in the center of the atrial septum. Normally, the right side of the heart pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs, while the left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body. An ASD allows blood from both sides to mix, causing the heart to work less efficiently. A small hole may not cause any symptoms or problems. A larger hole can eventually cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, respiratory infections, fainting, irregular heart rhythms or fatigue after mild activity. Larger ASDs can also ultimately lead to pulmonary artery hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement); SVT, or heart failure. Most cases of ASD are not inherited and occur by chance. Some cases appear to have autosomal dominant inheritance."
"Summary of Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini: Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini (ATPP) is a rare skin condition that results in patchy areas of discolored skin. The main symptom of Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini is multiple irregularly shaped, dark or light areas of skin in which the tissue under the skin breaks down resulting in a depression (dent). The cause of ATPP is unknown. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and a skin biopsy."
"Summary of Localized lipodystrophy: A rare group of acquired lipodystrophies that are characterized by loss of subcutaneous tissue from generally small regions of the body, either single or multiple areas, and are not typically associated with metabolic complications. Some cases may involve lipohypertrophy (insulin). This group includes pressure-induced localized lipoatrophy, drug-induced localized lipodystrophy, panniculitis- induced localized lipodystrophy, centrifugal lipodystrophy, and idiopathic localized lipodystrophy."
"Summary of Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) occurs when your immune system makes antibodies that attack your red blood cells. This causes a drop in the number of red blood cells, leading to hemolytic anemia. Symptoms may include unusual weakness and fatigue with tachycardia and breathing difficulties, jaundice, dark urine and/or splenomegaly. AIHA can be primary (idiopathic) or result from an underlying disease or medication. The condition may develop gradually or occur suddenly."
"Summary of Autoimmune hepatitis: Autoimmune hepatitis is a disease in which the body's immune system attacks liver cells. This immune response causes inflammation of the liver, also called hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis likely results from a combination of autoimmunity, environmental triggers, and a genetic predisposition. It occurs more frequently in females."
"Summary of B-cell lymphoma: ""B-cell lymphoma refers to types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that are characterized by abnormalities of the """"B-cells"""" (a type of white blood cell that makes antibodies to help fight infection). The condition may grow and spread slowly with few symptoms (also known as indolent lymphoma) or may be very aggressive with severe symptoms. When present, signs and symptoms may include swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpit, or groin; abdominal pain; fatigue; fever; night sweats; and/or weight loss. The underlying cause of B-cell lymphoma is poorly understood. However, the condition can be associated with genetic abnormalities, environmental factors, viruses, immunodeficiency states, and connective-tissue disorders."""
"Summary of Babesiosis: Babesiosis refers to a condition caused by microscopic parasites that infect the red blood cells. Many people who are infected with Babesia parasites do not experience any symptoms of the condition. When present, signs and symptoms may include flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, body aches, nausea and fatigue. In severe cases, Babesiosis may be associated with hemolytic anemia. Babesia parasites are primarily spread by infected ticks."
"Summary of Bacterial meningitis: Bacterial infections of the leptomeninges and subarachnoid space, frequently involving the cerebral cortex, cranial nerves, cerebral blood vessels, spinal cord, and nerve roots."
"Summary of Baló concentric sclerosis: BalÃ³ concentric sclerosis (Tumefactive multiple sclerosis) is characterized by a tumor-like lesion larger than two centimeters and signs and symptoms similar to those of a brain tumor. It is a rare form of multiple sclerosis (MS). Symptoms of BalÃ³ concentric sclerosis often differ from other MS cases and may include, headaches, changes in thinking, confusion, speech problems, seizures, and weakness. The cause of BalÃ³ concentric sclerosis is not known."
"Summary of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome: Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS) is a genetic condition that leads to the growth of both non-cancerous and cancerous tumors. Symptoms of BRRS may include large head size, increased birth weight, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Other symptoms include the appearance of non-cancerous tumors in the digestive system, fatty tumors under the skin, and freckles on the penis. People with BRRS have an increased risk of developing breast, thyroid, and uterine cancer. This condition is part of a group of conditions known as the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, which all share similar features and are caused by genetic changes (DNA variants) in the PTEN gene. BRRS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis is based on clinical exam, the symptoms, and genetic testing."
Summary of Banti's syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Barth syndrome: Barth syndrome is a metabolic and neuromuscular disorder, occurring almost exclusively in males, that primarily affects the heart, immune system, muscles, and growth. The main characteristics of the condition include abnormalities of heart and skeletal muscle (cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy); low levels of certain white blood cells called neutrophils that help to fight bacterial infections (neutropenia); and growth retardation, potentially leading to short stature. Other signs and symptoms may include increased levels of certain organic acids in the urine and blood (such as 3-methylglutaconic acid), and increased thickness of the left ventricle of the heart due to endocardial fibroelastosis, which can cause potential heart issues. Barth syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the TAZ gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner."
"Summary of Bartter syndrome: Bartter syndrome is a group of very similar kidney disorders that cause an imbalance of potassium, sodium, chloride, and related molecules in the body. In some cases, Bartter syndrome becomes apparent before birth. The disorder can cause polyhydramnios, which is an increased volume of fluid surrounding the fetus (amniotic fluid). Polyhydramnios increases the risk of premature birth. Beginning in infancy,babies with Bartter syndrome often fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They lose excess amounts of salt (sodium chloride) in their urine, which leads to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). In addition, large amounts of calcium are lost through the urine (hypercalciuria), which can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). Some of the calcium is deposited in the kidneys as they are concentrating urine, leading to hardening of the kidney tissue (nephrocalcinosis). Bartter syndrome is also characterized by low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), which can result in muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue. Rarely, affected children develop hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness). One form begins before birth (antenatal) and is often more severe. The other form, often called the classical form, begins in early childhood and tends to be less severe."
"Summary of Migraine with brainstem aura: Migraine with brainstem aura (MBA) is a type of migraine headache with aura that is associated with pain at the back of the head on both sides. An aura is a group of symptoms that generally serve as a warning sign that a bad headache is coming. Auras may consist of dizziness and vertigo, slurred speech, ataxia, tinnitus, visual changes, and/or loss of balance. The exact underlying cause of MBA is poorly understood. Migraines are likely complex disorders that are influenced by multiple genes, in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. In rare cases, susceptibility to MBA may be caused by a change in the ATP1A2 gene or CACNA1A gene."
"Summary of CLN3 disease: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 3 (CLN3-NCL) is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Symptoms may include rapidly progressive vision loss, developmental regression (loss of acquired milestones), cognitive decline, heart problems, seizures, speech disturbances, behavioral problems (including aggression), and movement abnormalities. CLN3-NCL is caused by changes in the CLN3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Congenital myopathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Congenital contractural arachnodactyly: Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is a genetic disorder that is characterized by tall height; skinny, long limbs; long, skinny fingers and toes (arachnodactyly); multiple joint deformities present at birth (congenital contractures), usually of the elbows, knees, hips, fingers and ankles; ""crumpled""-looking ears; and curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis). Enlargement (dilation) of the aorta and other features might also be present in some affected people. CCA is caused by genetic changes in a gene called FBN2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. CCA shares similiar signs and symptoms to Marfan syndrome; however, Marfan syndrome is not caused by genetic changes in the FBN2 gene."
"Summary of Becker muscular dystrophy: Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is an inherited condition that causes progressive weakness and wasting of the skeletal and cardiac (heart) muscles. It primarily affects males. In some cases, heart involvement (cardiomyopathy) is the first sign. BMD is caused by a genetic change in the DMD gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. BMD is very similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, except that in BMD, symptoms begin later and progress at a slower rate. People with BMD may survive into their 40s or beyond."

Summary of Bejel: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Bell's palsy: Bell's palsy is a form of temporary facial paralysis which results from damage or trauma to one of the facial nerves. Symptoms vary, but may include twitching, weakness, drooping eyelid or corner of the mouth, drooling, dry eye or mouth, impairment of taste, and excessive tearing in the eye. The exact cause is unknown."
"Summary of Diffuse astrocytoma: A rare low-grade astrocytoma characterized by a high degree of cellular differentiation, slow growth, and diffuse infiltration of adjacent brain structures, and corresponding to WHO grade II. The tumor typically affects young adults and has an intrinsic tendency for progression to high-grade glioma. Histological variants are fibrillary, gemistocytic, and protoplasmic astrocytoma. Patients most commonly present with seizures, but also with other neurological or neuropsychological abnormalities, depending on the location."
"Summary of Benign essential blepharospasm: Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by abnormal blinking or spasms of the eyelids. It is a form of dystonia, a group of movement disorders involving uncontrolled tensing of the muscles (contractions), rhythmic shaking (tremors), and other involuntary movements. BEB occurs in both men and women, although it is especially common in middle-aged women. Initial symptoms include an increased frequency of blinking, dry eyes, and eye irritation. As the condition progresses, spasms of the muscles surrounding the eyes cause involuntary winking or squinting and increasing difficulty keeping eyes open, which can lead to vision impairment. In more than half of all people with BEB, the symptoms affect other facial muscles and muscles in other areas of the body. When people with BEB also experience involuntary muscle spasms affecting the tongue and jaw, this is known as Meige syndrome. The cause of BEB is unknown; however, some cases appear to run through families."
Summary of Essential tremor: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Mucous membrane pemphigoid: Mucous membrane pemphigoid is a rare, chronic, blistering and scarring disease that affects the oral and ocular mucosa.  Other mucosal sites that might be affected include the nasopharnyx, larynx, genitalia, rectum, and esophagus. Scarring of the affected mucosa of the eye may lead to blindness. A combination of environmental and genetic factors appear to play a role in the susceptibility of developing cicatricial pemphigoid. Although the specific causes of this condition have not been identified, it is considered an autoimmune disease that is characterized by the production of autoantibodies against basement membrane zone antigens such as BP180, BP230, and laminin 5."
"Summary of Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: Benign recurrent vertigo (BRV), also known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), is a common disorder affecting up to 2% of the adult population. The majority of individuals with chronic recurrent vertigo have no identifiable cause, no progression of the disorder, and no other neurologic or auditory signs. Many families have multiple affected individuals, suggesting familial transmission of the disorder with moderate to high penetrance (summary by Lee et al., 2006)."
Summary of Beta-galactosidase-1 deficiency: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Biliary tract cancer: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Binswanger's disease: Binswanger's disease is a type of dementia caused by widespread, microscopic areas of damage to the deep layers of white matter in the brain. Most people with the disease experience progressive memory loss and deterioration of intellectual abilities (dementia); urinary urgency or incontinence; and an abnormally slow, unsteady gait (style of walking)."
"Summary of Birdshot chorioretinopathy: Birdshot chorioretinopathy is an eye condition in which painless, light-colored spots develop on the retina. These spots are scattered in a ""birdshot"" pattern. The effects of this condition on vision are quite variable; some individuals' vision is only mildly affected, whereas others experience a significant decline in vision, the appearance of floaters (small specks that appear in one's line of sight), night blindness, and other vision problems. The cause of Birdshot chorioretinopathy is currently unknown, but it is suspected to be an autoimmune disease."
"Summary of Blastomycosis: Blastomycosis is a rare infection that may develop when people inhale a fungus called Blastomyces dermatitidis, a fungus that is found in moist soil, particularly where there is rotting vegetation. The fungus enters the body through the lungs, infecting them. The fungus then spreads to other areas of the body. The infection may affect the skin, bones and joints, and other areas."
Summary of Blepharophimosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Blue diaper syndrome: Blue diaper syndrome is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by problems in the absorption of the aminoacid tryptophan and blue urine stains on diapers. Symptoms typically include digestive problems, fever, irritability, failure to thrive, and visual problems. The abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) may result in accumulation of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) leading to impaired kidney function and possible kidney failure. The bluish urine-stained diapers occur when intestinal bacteria break down excessive amounts of tryptophan, a nutrient of the diet, leading to increase of indican and related compounds in the urine (indicanuria). Although the exact nature of the biochemical defect remains uncertain, it is believed to be related to a defect in the intestinal absorption and transport of tryptophan. The defect in tryptophan absorption may be associated with genetic changes in the LAT2 and TAT1 genes. Inheritance is autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive."
"Summary of Blue rubber bleb nevus: Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is a condition in which the blood vessels do not develop properly in an area of the skin or other body organ (particularly the intestines). The malformed blood vessels appear as a spot or lesion called a nevus. The underlying blood vessel malformations are present from birth even though the nevus may not be visible until later in life. The size, number, location, and severity of these malformations vary from person to person. Affected areas on the skin can be painful or tender to the touch and may be prone to sweating (hyperhidrosis). Nevi in the intestines may bleed spontaneously and cause anemia or other complications. Other symptoms vary depending on the organ affected."
"Summary of Bowen's disease: A form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. It is a distinct clinicopathological entity and arises from the skin or the mucocutaneous junction. It affects predominantly white males in their 6-8th decades of life. Exposed and non-exposed skin sites are equally affected. UV damage and ingestion of inorganic arsenic may play a role in the development of the disease. On the skin surface, it presents as a single or multiple erythematous, scaly, keratotic patches or plaques. The clinical entity of erythroplasia of Queyrat is regarded as Bowen disease of the penis and it presents as an asymptomatic, red, circumscribed plaque. Morphologically, Bowen disease is characterized by the presence of hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, dyskeratosis, and acanthosis. The keratotic squamous cells are atypical and display hyperchromatism and abnormal mitotic figures. The dermoepidermal basement membrane is intact. Complete surgical removal of the lesion may be curative."
"Summary of Bowen-Conradi syndrome: Bowen-Conradi syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by growth delays before birth, failure to thrive during infancy, and malformations of the head and facial area. Other physical abnormalities include small head, prominent nose, small chin, mild joint restriction, clinodactyly, camptodactyly, foot deformities, and/or undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in affected males. Some affected infants may also have kidney, brain, and/or other abnormalities. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Bowenoid papulosis: Dysplastic papular lesions presenting on the genitalia of either sex. The lesions are associated with human papillomavirus infection. The majority of cases have a benign clinical course, although, a small number of cases with malignant transformation have been reported."
"Summary of Bronchiolitis obliterans with obstructive pulmonary disease: Bronchiolitis obliterans with obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), is a lung disease that causes inflammation in the small air tubes (bronchioles) and air sacs (alveoli). The signs and symptoms of BOOP vary but often include shortness of breath, a dry cough, and fever. BOOP can be caused by viral infections, various drugs, and other medical conditions. If the cause is known, the condition is called secondary BOOP. In many cases, the underlying cause of BOOP is unknown. These cases are called idiopathic BOOP or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia."
"Summary of Bronchopulmonary dysplasia: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic respiratory disease that results from complications related to lung injury during the treatment of infant acute respiratory distress syndrome (see these terms) in low-birth-weight premature infants or from abnormal lung development in older infants. Clinical signs are tachypnea, tachycardia and signs of respiratory distress such as intercostal recession, grunting and nasal flaring."
"Summary of Brown syndrome: Brown syndrome is an eye disorder characterized by abnormalities in the eye's ability to move. Specifically, the ability to look up and in is affected by a problem in the superior oblique muscle/tendon. The condition may be present at birth (congenital) or it may develop following surgery or as a result of inflammation or a problem with development. Some cases are constant while other are intermittent."
"Summary of Brown-Sequard syndrome: Brown-Sequard syndrome is a neurological condition that results from an injury or damage to one side of the spinal cord. This condition results in weakness or paralysis on one side of the body (hemiparaplegia) and a loss of sensation on the opposite side (hemianesthesia). Brown-Sequard syndrome most commonly occurs in the the thoracic spine (upper and middle back). There are several causes of Brown-Sequard syndrome, including: a spinal cord tumor, trauma (such as a puncture wound to the neck or back), infectious or inflammatory diseases (tuberculosis or multiple sclerosis), and disk herniation."
"Summary of Brucellosis: Brucellosis is a bacterial infection that spreads from animals to people via unpasteurized dairy products or by exposure to contaminated animal products or infected animals. Animals that are most commonly infected include sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, and dogs. Brucellosis can cause of range of signs and symptoms, some of which may persist or recur. Initial symptoms may include fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, fatigue, and/or pain in the muscles, joints, and/or back. Symptoms that may persist or recur include fevers, arthritis, swelling of the testicle and scrotum, swelling of the heart (endocarditis), neurologic symptoms (in up to 5% of cases), chronic fatigue, depression, and/or swelling of the liver or spleen. People who are in jobs or settings that increase exposure to the bacteria are at increased risk for infection."
"Summary of Budd-Chiari syndrome: Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by obstruction of the veins of the liver that carry the blood flow from the liver. When the blood flow out of the liver is impeded, blood backs up in the liver, causing it to enlarge (hepatomegaly). The spleen may also enlarge (splenomegaly). This backup of blood increases blood pressure in the portal vein, which carries blood to the liver from the intestines (portal hypertension), and result in dilated, twisted veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices). Portal hypertension, leads to fluid accumulating in the abdomen (called ascites). The clot may extend to also block the inferior vena cava (the large vein that carries blood from the lower parts of the body to the heart). Varicose veins in the abdomen near the skin's surface may develop and become visible. In some cases, scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) occurs. Other symptoms may include fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, jaundice and bleeding in the esophagus. The severity of the disorder varies from case to case, depending on the site and number of affected veins. It most often occurs in patients which have a disorder that makes blood more likely to clot, such as those who are pregnant or who have a tumor, a chronic inflammatory disease, a clotting disorder, an infection, or a myeloproliferative disorder. In about one third of the cases, the cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome is unknown."
"Summary of Buerger disease: Buerger disease is a disease in which small and medium-sized blood vessels in the arms and/or legs become inflamed and blocked (vasculitis). This reduces blood flow to affected areas of the body, eventually resulting damage to tissues. Symptoms of Buerger disease may include coldness, numbness, tingling or burning, and pain. Symptoms may first be felt in the fingertips or toes, and then move further up the arms or legs. Additional symptoms that may develop include changes in the texture and color of the skin, Raynaud's phenomenon, painful muscle cramps, swelling (edema), skin ulcers, and gangrene. Buerger disease almost always occurs in people who use tobacco, but it is not known exactly how tobacco plays a role in the development of the disease. Some people may have a genetic predisposition to Buerger disease. It is also possible that Buerger disease is an autoimmune disease, as the immune system seems to play a large role in its development."
"Summary of Bullous pemphigoid: Bullous pemphigoid is a skin disorder characterized by large blisters. The blisters are usually located on the arms, legs, or middle of the body. In some people, the mouth or genitals are also affected. The blisters may break open and form ulcers or open sores. Bullous pemphigoid usually occurs in older persons and is rare in young people. Symptoms may come and go. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disorder which occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake."
"Summary of Burkitt lymphoma: Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a very fast-growing type of cancer. It is a form of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Signs and symptoms may differ depending on the form of BL and the organs or body systems involved. When it spreads, weakness and fatigue often develop. Lymphoma cells may build up in the lymph nodes and other organs, causing swelling. Central nervous system involvement is possible with all forms of BL, particularly when there is advanced-stage disease. The exact cause of BL is not known. EBV infection appears to play a role in some cases. While acquired (not inherited) genetic changes involving the MYC gene and other genes are present within BL cancer cells, it is unclear what causes these genetic changes to occur."
"Summary of Burning mouth syndrome: Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by long-lasting burning sensations of the mouth. The pain may affect the tongue, gums, lips, palate, throat, or the entire mouth. Burning mouth syndrome may be primary or secondary. Experts believe that the primary form may be caused by damage to the nerves that control pain and taste. The secondary form is caused by an underlying medical condition. In many cases, the underlying cause in unknown."
"Summary of Scleredema: Scleredema is a form of cutaneous mucinosis, a diverse group of rare skin conditions that are characterized by an accumulation of mucin (a jelly-like complex carbohydrate substance) in the skin. Signs and symptoms of this condition include hardening and thickening of the skin which may restrict movement. Skin in affected areas may be red or brown and often has an 'orange-skin' appearance. In some cases, Scleredema resolves spontaneously on its own, while in other affected people, the condition persists for long periods of time."
"Summary of Byssinosis: A condition of BRONCHOCONSTRICTION resulting from hypersensitive reaction to inhaled dust during the initial processing of cotton, flax, or hemp in the textile industry. Symptoms include wheezing and tightness in the chest."
"Summary of C syndrome: C syndrome, also known as Opitz trigonocephaly syndrome, is characterized by trigonocephaly, severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, variable cardiac defects, redundant (extra folds of) skin, joint and limb abnormalities, and unusual facial features such as upslanted palpebral fissures (upward pointing outside corners of the eyes), epicanthal folds, depressed nasal bridge, and low-set, posteriorly rotated ears. There is evidence of more than one type of inheritance. While many cases are sporadic, autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and germline mosaicism have all been suggested. At least some cases of C syndrome have been caused by dysfunction of the CD96 gene."
"Summary of Hereditary angioedema: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a disease characterized by recurrent episodes (also called attacks) of severe swelling of the skin and mucous membranes. The frequency of attacks usually increases after puberty. Attacks most often affect 3 parts of the body: Skin - the most common sites are the face (such as the lips and eyes), hands, arms, legs, genitals, and buttocks. Skin swelling can cause pain, dysfunction, and disfigurement, although it is generally not dangerous and is temporary. Gastrointestinal tract - the stomach, intestines, bladder, and/or urethra may be involved. This may cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Upper airway (such as the larynx and tongue) - this can cause upper airway obstruction. The majority of attacks affecting the airway resolve before complete airway obstruction. Attacks may involve one area of the body at a time, or they may involve a combination of areas. They always go away on their own but last from 2 to 4 days. While people with HAE have reported various triggers of attacks, emotional stress, physical stress, and dental procedures are the most commonly reported triggers. HAE may be caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants) in the C1NH gene (also called the SERPING1 gene) or in the F12 gene. In some cases, the cause is not yet known. These types are also characterized by abnormal complement protein levels. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, but not all people with a SERPING1 genetic change will develop symptoms of HAE. Attacks generally continue throughout life, but the frequency of attacks can be significantly reduced with therapy."
"Summary of Calciphylaxis: Calciphylaxis is a disease in which blood vessels (veins and arteries) become blocked by a build-up of calcium in the walls of the vessels, preventing blood from flowing to the skin or internal organs. The lack of blood flow (ischemia) damages healthy tissue and may causes the tissue to die (necrosis). The most obvious and frequent symptom of Calciphylaxis is damage to the skin, as ulcers can develop and become infected easily. Calciphylaxis can also affect fat tissue, internal organs, and skeletal muscle, causing infections, pain, and organ failure. The exact cause of Calciphylaxis is unknown."
"Summary of Canavan disease: Canavan disease is a progressive, fatal, genetic disorder affecting the central nervous system, muscles, and eyes. Early symptoms in infancy may include increased head size, weakness, low muscle tone and loss of head control. Symptoms progress to seizures, blindness, inability to move voluntarily and difficulty eating solids or swallowing liquids. This condition is caused by changes in the ASPA gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Canavan disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, laboratory testing, and genetic testing."
"Summary of Carcinoid syndrome: Carcinoid syndrome refers to a group of symptoms that are associated with carcinoid tumors (rare, slow-growing tumors that occur most frequently in the gastroinestinal tract or lungs). Affected people may experience skin flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, skin lesions on the face (telangiectasias), and wheezing. In later stages, Carcinoid syndrome may damage the heart valves. The condition occurs when the carcinoid tumor secretes serotonin or other chemicals into the bloodstream."

"Summary of Carnosinase deficiency: A rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by low serum carnosinase activity, persistent carnosinuria, and carnosinemia. The clinical phenotype is highly variable, with some patients remaining asymptomatic, while others have been reported to show severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, and other neurological signs and symptoms."
"Summary of Caroli disease: Caroli disease is a condition characterized by an abnormal widening of the intrahepatic bile ducts (the ducts that carry bile from the liver) and renal cysts. People affected by this condition experience recurrent episodes of cholestasis, stone development in the bile ducts, and bacterial cholangitis. In addition to the symptoms of Caroli disease, people affected by Caroli syndrome may also experience liver fibrosis and portal hypertension (high blood pressure of the portal vein). Although the underlying cause of Caroli disease and Caroli syndrome are poorly understood, they are thought to be genetic conditions. Caroli disease generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition; however, rare reports exist of autosomal dominant inheritance in association with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Caroli syndrome is generally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is frequently seen in association with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease."
Summary of Carpenter syndrome: Carpenter syndrome is a condition characterized by premature fusion of skull bones (craniosynostosis); finger and toe abnormalities; and other developmental problems. The features in affected people vary. Craniosynostosis can give the head a pointed appearance; cause asymmetry of the head and face; affect the development of the brain; and cause characteristic facial features. Other signs and symptoms may include dental abnormalities; vision problems; hearing loss; heart defects; genital abnormalities; obesity; various skeletal abnormalities; and a range of intellectual disability. Carpenter syndrome can be caused by genetic changes in the RAB23 or MEGF8 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
Summary of Cartilaginous cancer: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Unicentric Castleman disease: Unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) is a condition that affects the lymph nodes and related tissues. It is a form of Castleman disease that is ""localized"" to a single set of lymph nodes (as opposed to multicentric Castleman disease which has more widespread effects). UCD often starts as an enlarged lymph node. Depending on the location of this enlarged node, some people will have no additional features of the condition, while others will develop symptoms when it pushes on nearby organs and/or tissues. The exact underlying cause of UCD is currently unknown."
"Summary of Caudal regression syndrome: Caudal regression sequence (CRS) affects the development of the lower (caudal) half of the body. It can impact the development of the lower back, spinal cord, and lower limbs. The kidneys, bladder, digestive tract, and genitalia may also be affected. CRS occurs during fetal development and is present at birth. The features and severity vary from person to person. Some people with CRS may have problems with bowel and bladder control and be unable to walk. CRS is not known to affect the development of the brain and intelligence is generally average. The cause of CRS is unknown, and is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Maternal diabetes, exposure to retinoic acid, and disorders of blood flow are thought to increase the chance for a woman to have a baby with CRS, but most babies with CRS are born to women without any known risk factor. CRS is diagnosed based on the features. Other conditions may need to be excluded before a diagnosis of CRS can be made."
"Summary of Macrocystic lymphatic malformation: A rare common cystic lymphatic malformation characterized by a benign cystic lesion composed of dilated lymphatic channels. Macrocystic lesions consist of cysts larger than 1 cm in diameter. They usually present at birth or during the first years of life and most often occur in the head and neck region but may affect any site. Symptoms depend on the location and extent of the lesion. Infection, trauma, or intracystic hemorrhage can lead to lesional expansion. Malignant transformation does not occur."
"Summary of Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria: Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP) is a neurological disorder that affects the cerebral cortex (the outer surface of the brain). The cerebral cortex of the brain normally consists of several deep folds and grooves. In BPP, the grooves that develop during embryonic growth form improperly on both sides of the brain near the Sylvian fissure, resulting in an increased number of folds that are unusually small. Signs and symptoms typically become apparent at birth, infancy, or later during childhood, and may include partial paralysis of the face, tongue, jaw, and throat; problems with speech and swallowing; excessive drooling; and seizures. Mild to severe intellectual disability often is also present. Some people with BPP have other health problems or birth defects. Most cases of BPP occur sporadically in people with no family history of BPP. Rarely, more than one family member has BPP, and the pattern of inheritance depends on the cause. Genetic causes may include genetic changes in single genes and contiguous gene disorders such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. BPP has also been reported in association with twin pregnancy complications. The diagnosis of BPP is based on the symptoms present and a thorough neurological evaluation including various imaging techniques."
"Summary of Central core disease: Central core disease (CCD) is an inherited condition that involves muscle weakness, skeletal abnormalities, and an increased chance of having a severe reaction to some anesthesia medications. Muscle weakness ranges from mild to severe and typically affects muscles in the trunk and upper legs, though muscles in the neck and face can also be affected. Skeletal abnormalities may include curving of the spine (scoliosis), dislocation of the hip, or restricted motion in certain joints (contractures). Some individuals with CCD have an increased chance of having a severe reaction to anesthesia, called malignant hyperthermia, which may cause muscle rigidity or break-down (rhabdomyolysis), a high fever, or a rapid heart beat. RYR1 is the only gene associated with CCD and clinical testing is available to look for disease-causing alterations in this gene known as pathogenic variants ."
"Summary of Central diabetes insipidus: Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is a form of DI that occurs when the body has lower than normal levels of antidiuretic hormone, which is characterized by frequent urination. When this hormone reaches the kidneys, it directs them to make less urine. The major symptoms of Central diabetes insipidus (DI) include urinating too much (polyuria), getting up at night to urinate (nocturia), and drinking too much liquids (polydipsia). Damage to the pituitary gland can be caused by different diseases as well as by head injuries, neurosurgery, or genetic disorders."
"Summary of Cerebellar degeneration: Cerebellar degeneration refers to the deterioration of neurons (nerve cells) in the cerebellum (the area of the brain that controls muscle coordination and balance). Conditions that cause Cerebellar degeneration may also affect other areas of the central nervous system, such as the spinal cord, the cerebral cortex (the thin layer of cells covering the brain), and the brain stem. Signs and symptoms of Cerebellar degeneration may include a wide-based, uncoordinated walk; a back and forth tremor in the trunk of the body; uncoordinated movements of the arms and legs; slow and slurred speech; and nystagmus. Cerebellar degeneration can be caused by a variety of factors including inherited gene changes , chronic alcohol abuse, and paraneoplastic disorders."
Summary of Cerebral ventricle cancer: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cerebrocostomandibular syndrome: Cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome (CCMS) is a condition characterized by severe micrognathia (abnormally small jaw), abnormalities of the roof of the mouth (palate), and rib defects. Other signs and symptoms may include intellectual disability and microcephaly (small head size). In some cases, the features cause respiratory problems. Most cases appear to occur randomly (sporadically), but both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. No specific gene known to cause the condition has been identified."
"Summary of COFS syndrome: Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome is a degenerative disorder that primarily involves the brain, eyes, and spinal cord. Affected individuals have mild to severe intellectual disability, severely reduced muscle tone (hypotonia), impaired reflexes, vision impairment, and involuntary eye movements. Children with COFS syndrome have distinctive facial features, including low-set ears, small eyes, small head size (microcephaly), and a small jaw (micrognathia). They may also have abnormalities of the skull, limbs, heart, and kidneys. Individuals with COFS syndrome are often diagnosed at birth. In many cases, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Some children with this condition have genetic changes in the ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC5, or ERCC6 gene. COFS syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Chagas disease: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Chandler syndrome: Chandler's syndrome is an eye disorder in which the single layer of cells lining the interior of the cornea proliferates, causing changes within the iris, corneal swelling, and unusually high pressure in the eye (glaucoma). In most cases, only one eye is affected. Symptoms may include reduced vision and pain. Chandler's syndrome more often affects females and usually presents sometime during middle age. The cause of this disease is unknown."
"Summary of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease/Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease/Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy is a group of disorders that affect the peripheral nerves, the nerves running from outside the brain and spine. Defects in many different genes cause different forms of this disease. Common symptoms may include foot drop, foot deformity, loss of lower leg muscle, numbness in the foot or leg, slapping gait (feet hit the floor hard when walking), and weakness of the hips, legs, or feet."
"Summary of Chédiak-Higashi syndrome: Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a genetic syndrome that affects the immune system, as well as other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms include a weakened immune system, repeated and persistent infections beginning in infancy and childhood, oculocutaneous albinism, blood clotting problems, and nervous system abnormalities (e.g., weakness, difficulty walking, and seizures). It is caused by genetic changes in the LYST gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Cherubism: Cherubism is a disorder characterized by progressive, painless, bilateral swelling of the jaw. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs, family history, radiographic findings (panoramic x-rays, CT scan), biopsy, and genetic testing. Cherubism is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is caused by genetic changes in the SH3BP2 gene."
Summary of Chiari-Frommel syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Chikungunya: A rare infectious disease characterized by acute onset of high fever associated with debilitating polyarthralgia and usually accompanied by an erythematous skin rash (that may progress to vesiculobullous lesions in children) caused by the mosquitoe-borne Chikungunya virus. Myalgia, severe headache, and lymphadenopathy are frequently associated. Chronically the disease may cause recurrent, long-term polyarthralgia, arthritis, fatigue, and depression."
"Summary of CHILD syndrome: CHILD syndrome, also known as congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects, is a genetic condition that is typically characterized by large patches of skin that are red and inflamed (erythroderma) and covered with flaky scales (ichthyosis) and limb underdevelopment or absence. The symptoms normally occur on one side of the body. The development of organs such as the brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys may also be affected. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the NSDHL gene, a gene that provides instructions for the production of an enzyme involved in the making of cholesterol. CHILD syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant fashion and is almost exclusively found in females. CHILD syndrome is diagnosed based on the symptoms and through genetic testing."
"Summary of Childhood disintegrative disorder: Childhood disintergrative disorder is a rare pervasive developmental disorder with a disease onset before the age of three and characterized by a dramatic loss of behavioral and developmental functioning after atleast two years of normal development. Manifestations of the disease include loss of speech, incontinence, communication and social interaction problems, stereotypical autistic behaviors and dementia."
"Summary of Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is a cancer that develops in the cells within the bile ducts; both inside and outside the liver. The terms cholangiocarinoma and bile duct cancer are often used to refer to the same condition. Signs and symptoms of Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma include jaundice, abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, weakness and itching."
"Summary of Cholera: Cholera is an infection of the small intestines that is caused by the bacterium Vibrio Cholera. The condition can range from mild to severe and many affected people may have no obvious signs or symptoms. A small percentage of infected people will have severe disease with watery diarrhea and vomiting leading to rapid fluid loss, dehydration, and shock. People develop Cholera when they eat food or drink water that is contaminated with Vibrio Cholera. The condition occurs most often in places that lack water treatment and have poor sanitation and inadequate hygiene."
"Summary of Chondroblastoma: A benign, chondroid-producing, well-circumscribed, lytic neoplasm usually arising from the epiphysis of long bones. It is characterized by the presence of chondroblasts, osteoclast-like giant cells, chondroid formation, calcification, and mitotic activity. In aggressive cases, there is rearrangement of the 8q21 chromosome band. It occurs most frequently in children and young adults and rarely metastasizes."
Summary of Chondrocalcinosis 1: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1: Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1) is a condition that impairs the normal development of many parts of the body. The major features of this disorder include skeletal abnormalities, distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and respiratory problems. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the PEX7 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The types have similar features and are distinguished by their genetic cause."
Summary of Chondrodysplasia punctata with steroid sulfatase deficiency: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Chondrodystrophy: A term referring to disorders characterized by abnormalities in the development of bones and cartilage.
"Summary of Chondroma: A benign neoplasm derived from mesodermal cells that form cartilage. It may remain within the substance of a cartilage or bone (true chondroma or enchondroma) or may develop on the surface of a cartilage (ecchondroma or ecchondrosis). (Dorland, 27th ed; Stedman, 25th ed)"
"Summary of Synovial Chondromatosis: Synovial Chondromatosis is a type of non-cancerous tumor that arises in the lining of a joint. The knee is most commonly affected, however it can affect any joint. The tumors begin as small nodules of cartilage. These nodules can separate and become loose within the joint. Some tumors may be no larger than a grain of rice. Signs and symptoms may include pain, swelling, a decreased range of motion, and locking of the joint. The exact underlying cause of the condition is unknown."
"Summary of Chondrosarcoma: Chondrosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor arising from cartilaginous tissue, most frequently occuring at the ends of the femur and tibia, the proximal end of the humerus and the pelvis; and presenting with a palpable mass and progressive pain. Chondrosarcoma is usually slow growing at low histological grades and can be well managed by intralesional curettage or en-block wide resection."
"Summary of Choriocarcinoma: A malignant metastatic form of trophoblastic tumors. Unlike the HYDATIDIFORM MOLE, choriocarcinoma contains no CHORIONIC VILLI but rather sheets of undifferentiated cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts (TROPHOBLASTS). It is characterized by the large amounts of CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN produced. Tissue origins can be determined by DNA analyses: placental (fetal) origin or non-placental origin (CHORIOCARCINOMA, NON-GESTATIONAL)."
Summary of Chorioretinitis: An inflammation of the choroid and retina.
"Summary of Choroideremia: Choroideremia is a genetic condition that causes vision loss. This disorder typically affects males. The first symptom is usually impairment of night vision (night blindness), which can occur in childhood. People with this disorder also experience narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) and decrease in the ability to see details (visual acuity). The vision problems are due to loss of cells in the retina (light sensitive part of the eye) and choroid (blood vessels in the eye). The rate and degree of vision loss differs for each person. Choroideremia is caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants) in the CHM gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern."
Summary of Choroiditis: Inflammation of the choroid.
"Summary of Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma: Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma is a rare subtype of the most common form of kidney cancer called renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This type of cancer forms in the cells lining the small tubules in the kidney. These tubules help filter waste from the blood, making urine."
Summary of Chromosomal triplication: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Chromosome 12p deletion: Deletion of the short arm of chromosome 12. The syndrome is relatively rare and has a variable phenotype, consisting of growth and mental retardation and various craniofacial, neurological, and other abnormalities."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 13 syndrome: Ring chromosome 13 is a rare chromosome abnormality in which the ends of chromosome 13 join together to form a ring shape. When a ring forms, there may be missing genes where the chromosome's ends fuse together. Therefore, the severity and symptoms associated with Ring chromosome 13 vary from person to person, depending on the number of genes, and specific genes, involved. Most people with Ring chromosome 13 also have cells with 46 normal chromosomes (this is called mosaicism), which can lessen the effect of the ring chromosome on growth and development. Signs and symptoms that may be present in a person with Ring chromosome 13 include developmental delay, slow growth and short stature, feeding difficulties, learning difficulties, a small head size, abnormal formation or positioning of the feet and/or toes, and/or abnormalities of the palate (roof off the mouth). Depending on how many genes are lost and how many normal cells a person has, additional features or birth defects may also be present. Ring chromosome 13 typically is not inherited, occurring sporadically during the formation of egg or sperm cells or shortly after the egg and sperm join together. In some cases, Ring chromosome 13 is inherited from a parent. Chromosome testing of parents can help determine whether the ring chromosome was inherited and whether future children have an increased chance to have a chromosome abnormality."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 14 syndrome: Ring chromosome 14 is a rare chromosome abnormality in which the ends (arms) of chromosome 14 join together to form a ring shape.   Signs and symptoms of Ring 14 syndrome vary from person to person but often include distinctive facial features, developmental delay and intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, intractable (hard to control) epilepsy, and occasional eye and vision abnormalities. Severity and frequency of seizures may improve over time. Other signs and symptoms may include a small head size (microcephaly), low muscle tone (hypotonia), scoliosis, and increased susceptibility to infections. Ring chromosomes almost always occur sporadically (by chance), occurring for the first time in people with no family history of chromosome disorders. In these cases, it occurs as a random event when egg or sperm cells are formed, or very soon after the egg and sperm join together. It is believed that several important genes near the end of the long arm of chromosome 14 are lost (deleted) when the ring forms, likely leading to some of the features of r(14) syndrome."
Summary of Chromosome 17p deletion: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Ring chromosome 18 syndrome: Ring chromosome 18 is a rare chromosome abnormality in which the ends (arms) of chromosome 18 join together to form a ring shape. When a ring chromosome forms, genetic material can be lost from either arm or both arms, causing various signs and symptoms. While most people with Ring chromosome 18 have the ring chromosome in all of their body cells, some people also have some body cells with normal chromosomes (this is called mosaicism). People with Ring chromosome 18 mosaicism may have milder symptoms. Depending on the amount of genetic material lost and which genes are involved, signs and symptoms that may be present in a person with Ring chromosome 18 include ear and hearing abnormalities, abnormally-developed feet or hands, genital abnormalities in males, an increased risk to develop juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, holoprosencephaly, developmental delays, learning difficulties, short stature, and/or various birth defects. Ring chromosome 18 usually occurs sporadically (by chance) during the formation of egg or sperm cells or shortly after the egg and sperm join together. Occasionally, it is inherited from a parent (typically the mother). A chromosome test of the parents can help determine whether it was inherited and whether future children have an increased chance to have a chromosome abnormality."
"Summary of 1p36 deletion syndrome: 1p36 deletion syndrome is a chromosome disorder that typically causes severe intellectual disability. Most affected individuals do not speak, or speak only a few words. They may have temper tantrums, bite themselves, or exhibit other behavior problems. Most have structural abnormalities of the brain, and seizures occur in more than half of individuals with this disorder. Individuals with Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome usually have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). Other features include a small head that is unusually short and wide; vision and hearing problems; abnormalities of the skeleton, heart, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, or genitalia; and distinctive facial features. Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material from a specific region in the short (p) arm of chromosome 1. Most cases are not inherited; only about 20% of the cases of people with 1p36 deletion syndrome inherit the chromosome with a deleted segment from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 21 syndrome: Ring chromosome 21 is a rare chromosome abnormality in which the ends of chromosome 21 join together to form a ring shape. Many people with Ring chromosome 21 have normal development and are healthy, having been diagnosed after having chromosome testing due to infertility, multiple miscarriages, or a child with a chromosome abnormality. However, others with Ring chromosome 21 have developmental and/or medical problems which can range from mild to severe. This is due to having extra or missing genetic material on the ring chromosome, which can happen when the ring chromosome forms. Signs and symptoms of Ring chromosome 21 that may be present can include short stature, delayed puberty in males, small head size, seizures, learning disabilities, underdeveloped sex organs, susceptibility to infections, and/or a variety of birth defects. Some people have signs and symptoms similar to those that occur in people with Down syndrome (also known as Trisomy 21). Ring chromosome 21 may be inherited from a parent (typically the mother), or it may occur sporadically (by chance) during the formation of egg or sperm cells or shortly after the egg and sperm join together. A chromosome test of the parents can help determine whether it was inherited and whether future children have an increased chance to have a chromosome abnormality."
"Summary of Mosaic trisomy 22: Mosaic trisomy 22 is a chromosome disorder in which chromosome 22 is present three times, instead of the usual two times, in some cells of the body. The range and severity of the disorder can vary widely. Some of the features that have been associated with this condition include growth delays, cognitive deficiencies, unequal development of the two sides of the body (hemidystrophy), webbing of the neck, abnormal deviation of the elbows when extended (cubitus valgus), multiple pigmented moles or birthmarks, distinctive malformations of the head and face, and other physical abnormalities. A number of cases of children with Mosaic trisomy 22 and normal growth and development have also been described."
"Summary of Chromosome 4p deletion: Chromosome 4p deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 4. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Chromosome 4p deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children."
"Summary of Trisomy 4p: Trisomy 4p is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 4. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Trisomy 4p include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Although some cases occur sporadically, most are inherited from a parent who has a balanced translocation."
"Summary of Trisomy 5p: Trisomy 5p is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the short arm (p) of chromosome 5. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Trisomy 5p include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the duplication on to their children."
"Summary of Ring chromosome 6 syndrome: Ring chromosome 6 syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with highly variable phenotype principally characterized by prenatal/postnatal growth failure, intellectual disability, developmental delay, craniofacial dysmorphism (incl. microcephaly, microphthalmia, epicanthus, low-set and malformed ears, broad and flat nasal bridge, full lips, micrognathia), central nervous system anomalies (e.g. hydrocephalus, cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly), short neck, and delayed bone age. Cardiac defects, limb anomalies, hip joint malformations, and seizures have also been reported."
Summary of Chronic erosive gastritis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Chronic granulomatous disease: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare, inherited immunodeficiency that affects certain white blood cells. People with this condition have immune systems that do not function properly, leaving the body vulnerable to chronic inflammation and frequent bacterial and fungal infections. It is caused by changes in any one of five different genes and is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive manner."
"Summary of Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a neurological disorder that causes progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs and arms. Symptoms often include tingling or numbness (first in the toes and fingers), weakness of the arms and legs, loss of deep tendon reflexes, fatigue, and abnormal sensations. Other symptoms may include pain, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and double vision (diplopia). CIDP is thought to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking and damaging the myelin sheath (protective cover of nerve fibers) of the peripheral nerves. CIDP is closely related to Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and is considered the ""chronic counterpart"" of GBS."
"Summary of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer of the white blood cells (lymphocytes). Early signs and symptoms may include swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, weight loss, fever, night sweats and/or frequent infections. Over time, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia may also spread to the lymph nodes and other organs, including the liver, spleen and lungs. The underlying cause is thought to be a combination of genetic and other unknown factors. It usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, but familial cases have been reported. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia is diagnosed based on the symptoms and various blood tests."
Summary of Chronic myeloid leukemia: Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is the most common myeloproliferative disorder accounting for 15-20% of all leukaemia cases.
"Summary of Neutropenia, lethal congenital, with eosinophilia: Neutropenia, lethal congenital, with eosinophilia is a rare and serious disease that affects newborns. It is characterized by recurrent infections, absence of neutrophils, and a higher than normal number of eosinophils. Neutrophils and eosinophils are types of white blood cells that help the body fight infections."
"Summary of Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis/Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis: Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) causes abnormal inflammation to occur in and around the bones. Symptoms usually begin in childhood but can occur at any age. Symptoms may include episodes of pain and joint swelling, skin redness, and sometimes a fever. In some cases, CRMO leads to abnormal bone growth, bone deformity, and fractures. CRMO may occur alone or with other skin or bowel inflammation conditions. In rare cases, CRMO occurs as part of one of these genetic syndromes: Majeed syndrome, DIRA or PAPA syndrome. The cause of CRMO is unknown, but a genetic influence is thought to be involved. Diagnosis of CRMO is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and imaging studies. Other more common conditions may need to be excluded before a diagnosis of CRMO can be made."
"Summary of Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg Strauss syndrome) is a condition characterized by asthma, high levels of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that helps fight infection), and inflammation of small to medium sized blood vessels (vasculitis). The inflamed vessels can affect various organ systems including the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, heart and nervous system. The exact cause of Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder."
Summary of Ciguatera fish poisoning: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Citrullinemia type I: Citrullinemia type 1 is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic substances to accumulate in the blood. Symptoms usually begin shorlty after birth and include excessive sleepiness, poor appetite, vomiting, and irritability. As ammonia builds up, muscle weakness and more serious symptoms may develop. Citrullinemia is caused by genetic changes in the ASS1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This disorder is often detected through newborn screening and confirmed by additional medical and genetic tests."
"Summary of Cleidocranial dysplasia: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) affects the development of the bones, skull, and teeth. Signs and symptoms include underdeveloped or absent collarbones (clavicles), dental abnormalities, and delayed closing of the spaces between the skull bones (fontanels). Other symptoms may include decreased bone density (osteopenia), hearing loss, bone abnormalities of the hands, and recurrent sinus and ear infections. People with CCD may develop curvature of the spine (scoliosis), osteoporosis, and may be shorter than average. CCD occurs due to a RUNX2 gene that is not working correctly and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, imaging studies, and genetic testings."
"Summary of Coats disease: Coats disease is an eye disorder characterized by abnormal development of the blood vessels in the retina (retinal telangiectasia). Most people begin showing symptoms in childhood. Early signs and symptoms vary but may include vision loss, ""crossed eyes"" (strabismus), and a white mass in the pupil behind the lens of the eye (leukocoria). Over time, Coats disease may also lead to retinal detachment, glaucoma, and clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). In most cases, only one eye is affected. Coats disease is not inherited and the underlying cause is not known. It has been theorized that some cases may be due to somatic genetic changes (acquired, not inherited) in the NDP gene."
"Summary of Cockayne syndrome: Cockayne syndrome is a rare disease which causes short stature, premature aging (progeria), severe photosensitivity, and moderate to severe learning delay. This syndrome also includes failure to thrive, very small head (microcephaly), and impaired nervous system development. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, tooth decay, vision problems, and bone abnormalities. Cockayne syndrome is caused by genetic changes in either the ERCC8 (CSA) or ERCC6 (CSB) genes. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Coffin-Lowry syndrome: Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a genetic condition that affects many parts of the body. The signs and symptoms and severity vary from person to person; however, males are typically more severely affected than females. Signs and symptoms may include distinct facial findings, short stature, microcephaly, kyphoscoliosis, other skeletal abnormalities, stimulus-induced drop episodes, intellectual disability and delayed development. Genetic changes in the RPS6KA3 gene cause the syndrome. It is inherited in an X-linked dominant fashion."
"Summary of Coffin-Siris syndrome: Coffin-Siris syndrome is a genetic condition that causes variable degrees of learning disability, developmental delays, underdeveloped 'pinky' toenails or fingernails, and distinct facial features. It can be caused by a change in any of several genes including the ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCA4, SMARCB1, DPF2 or SMARCE1 genes. Coffin-Siris syndrome follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, however it usually occurs for the first time in a family due to a new genetic change. Occupational, physical, and/or speech therapy can help affected individuals reach their full potential."
"Summary of Cogan-Reese syndrome: Cogan-Reese syndrome is one type of Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) syndrome. The ICE syndromes predominantly affect Caucasian, young to middle-aged women, and involve one eye. There have been some cases of Cogan-Reese syndrome reported in children. Symptoms may include a matted or smudged appearance to the surface of the iris; the development of small colored lumps on the iris (nodular iris nevi); the attachment of portions of the iris to the cornea (peripheral anterior synechiae); and/or increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma)."
"Summary of Cohen syndrome: Cohen syndrome is a congenital (present at birth) condition. Symptoms vary considerably from person to person but may include distinctive facial features, retinal dystrophy, nearsightedness, small head size, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, weak muscle tone, and unusually large range of joint movement.  Although the exact cause of Cohen syndrome is unknown, some people with the condition have been found to have genetic changes in a gene called COH1 (also referred to as VPS13B). When Cohen syndrome is found to be inherited in families, it follows an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Cold agglutinin disease: Cold agglutinin disease is a rare type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys its own red blood cells. When affected people's blood is exposed to cold temperatures (32Âº to 50Âº F), certain proteins that normally attack bacteria (IgM antibodies) attach themselves to red blood cells and bind them together into clumps (agglutination). This eventually causes red blood cells to be prematurely destroyed (hemolysis) leading to anemia and other associated signs and symptoms. Cold agglutinin disease can be primary (unknown cause) or secondary, due to an underlying condition such as an infection, another autoimmune disease, or certain cancers."
"Summary of Cold urticaria: Cold urticaria is an allergic condition that affects the skin. Symptoms usually start in early adulthood. The most common symptom is a red, itchy rash that appears on the skin when it is exposed to the cold (e.g. cold weather or cold water). This reaction usually occurs within 5-10 minutes after exposure and can last for 1-2 hours. The exact cause of Cold urticaria is unknown. In some cases, it may be associated with an infection, insect bite, or blood cancer. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms and confirmed through tests that look for a specific reaction to cold."
"Summary of Collagenous colitis: Collagenous colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon. It is a form of microscopic colitis, which causes chronic diarrhea. In all forms of microscopic colitis, the colon appears normal or almost normal on colonoscopy, but the inflammation is visible when a biopsy of the colon is examined under a microscope (hence its name). People with this disease usually have between four and nine watery bowel movements per day, but in rare cases may have more than fifteen. Various other symptoms relating to the gastrointestinal system or other body symptoms may also be present. The cause of Collagenous colitis is not known but it is thought to be multifactorial. This means that both genetic and environmental factors may interact to cause a person to develop the disease. The extent to which genes play a role is unclear, but familial cases have been described. Certain medications, such as NSAIDS and proton pump inhibitors, have been reported to cause or trigger the disease in some people. However, strong evidence directly linking these medications to the disease is still lacking."
Summary of Colonic malakoplakia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Common variable immunodeficiency: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a group of disorders characterized by low levels of a type of protein known as immunoglobulins (Ig). Because of low level of Ig, the immune system cannot make antibodies that fight bacteria, viruses or other toxins in the body. This leads to frequent infections, particularly in the sinuses, lungs, and digestive tract. Symptoms most commonly begin in early adulthood but can occur at any age. While in most cases the cause of CVID is unknown, a genetic change has been found in about one-third of cases. This condition is diagnosed based on the symptoms, specific laboratory testings, and exclusion of other disorders."
"Summary of Compartment syndrome: Conditions in which increased pressure within a limited space compromises the BLOOD CIRCULATION and function of tissue within that space. Some of the causes of increased pressure are TRAUMA, tight dressings, HEMORRHAGE, and exercise. Sequelae include nerve compression (NERVE COMPRESSION SYNDROMES); PARALYSIS; and ISCHEMIC CONTRACTURE."
Summary of Cone-rod dystrophy 2: Cone-rod dystrophy 2 (CORD2) is an inherited eye disorder that affects the rod and cone cells in the retina. These cells process light and allow people to see the accurate shape and color of objects. Initial signs and symptoms of CORD2 usually occur in early childhood or late adolescence and include decreased sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). CORD2 is caused by genetic changes in the CRX gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
"Summary of Hereditary thrombophilia due to congenital antithrombin deficiency: Hereditary thrombophilia due to congenital antithrombin deficiency is a disorder in which individuals are at increased risk for developing blood clots. The type of blood clots seen in individuals with this condition are typically clots that form in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) and clots that lodge in the lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE). Approximately 50% of individuals with Hereditary thrombophilia due to congenital antithrombin deficiency will develop one or more clots in their lifetime, usually after adolescence. Factors that may increase the likelihood of clotting include pregnancy, the use of oral contraceptives, surgery, increasing age, and a lack of movement. Hereditary thrombophilia due to congenital antithrombin deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the SERPINC1 gene and is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Congenital aplastic anemia: familial or idiopathic form, usually fatal; Fanconi's anemia presents before age 10, marked by microcephaly, skin discolorations, and sexual and mental retardation."
Summary of Congenital arteriovenous shunt: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Congenital cardiovascular shunt: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Congenital fiber-type disproportion myopathy: Congenital fiber type disproportion is a type of congenital myopathy. Congenital myopathy refers to a group of muscle disorders that appear at birth or in infancy. Early signs and symptoms of Congenital fiber type disproportion include floppiness, limb and facial weakness, and breathing problems. It is a genetic disease caused by genetic changes in the ACTA1, SEPN1, RYR1 or TPM3 genes. Depending on the gene and genetic change involved, Congenital fiber type disproportion can be passed through families in an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked manner."
"Summary of Congenital heart block: Congenital heart block is a rare condition that affects the heart's electrical system, which controls and coordinates its pumping function. In infants affected by this condition, the electrical signal that spreads across the heart and causes it to contract and pump blood, is slowed or completely interrupted. This can interfere with the heart's normal rate and rhythm and may significantly limit the ability of the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body. Congenital heart block generally develops between 18 and 33 weeks of pregnancy. The underlying cause of the condition is poorly understood. However, mothers with lupus or another autoimmune diseases and parents with congenital heart disorders have an increased risk of having a child with a Congenital heart block."
Summary of Congenital hemolytic anemia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Polycystic kidney disease 4 with or without polycystic liver disease: Polycystic kidney disease 4 with or without polycystic liver disease (Congenital hepatic fibrosis) is a rare disease of the liver that is present at birth. Symptoms include the following: a large liver, a large spleen, gastrointestinal bleeding caused by varices, increased pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood to the liver (portal hypertension), and scar tissue in the liver (fibrosis). Isolated Polycystic kidney disease 4 with or without polycystic liver disease is rare; it usually occurs as part of a syndrome that also affects the kidneys."
"Summary of Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP) affects the skin and is due to a build-up of damaging chemicals in the body. Symptoms usually begin in infancy and include extreme sun sensitivity, extra body hair, discolored teeth, and anemia. Over time, people with HEP may lose skin, bone or develop scarring in sun-exposed areas. HEP is caused by a UROD gene that is not working correctly and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. HEP is diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical exam, laboratory testing, and confirmed by genetic testing."
Summary of Congenital nonhemolytic jaundice: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Ligneous conjunctivitis: Ligneous conjunctivitis is a rare disorder characterized by the buildup of a protein called fibrin which causes inflammation of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis) and leads to thick, woody (ligneous), inflamed growths that are yellow, white, or red. Ligneous conjunctivitis most often occurs on the inside of the eyelids, but may also affect the sclera, cornea and pupil, leading to vision loss. A systemic form of the condition may occur, affecting the mucous membranes of the larynx, vocal chords, nose, trachea, bronchi, vagina, cervix, and gingiva. The cause of Ligneous conjunctivitis is unknown. Autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested in some cases. Ligneous conjunctivitis is sometimes associated with a condition known as congenital plasminogen deficiency."
"Summary of X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata: X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata 2 (CDPX2), also known as Conradi-HÃ¼nermann-Happle syndrome, is a rare form of skeletal dysplasia characterized by skeletal malformations, skin abnormalities, cataracts and short stature. The specific symptoms and severity of the disorder may vary greatly from one individual to another. CDPX2 is caused by genetic changes in the emopamil binding protein gene, EBP. In many cases, this genetic change occurs randomly, for no apparent reason (i.e., new genetic change). The condition is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait and occurs almost exclusively in females."
"Summary of Conversion disorder: Conversion disorder is a disorder in which a person experiences blindness, paralysis, or other symptoms affecting the nervous system that cannot be explained solely by a physical illness or injury. Symptoms usually begin suddenly after a period of emotional or physical distress or psychological conflict. Conversion disorder is thought to be caused by the body's reaction to a stressful physical or emotional event. Some research has identified potential neurological changes that may be related to symptoms of the disorder. Diagnosis of Conversion disorder is based on identifying particular signs that are common among people with the disorder, as well as performing tests to rule out other causes of the symptoms."
Summary of Cor biloculare: A congenital anatomic anomaly in which the heart has only two chambers.
"Summary of Triatrial heart: Triatrial heart is an extremely rare congenital (present at birth) heart defect. The human heart normally has four chambers, two ventricles and two atria. The two atria are normally separated from each other by a partition called the atrial septum and the two ventricles by the ventricle septum. In Triatrial heartthere is a small extra chamber above the left atrium (Triatrial heart sinistrum) or right atrium (Triatrial heart dextrum). In children, Triatrial heart may be associated with major congenital cardiac problems. In adults, it is often an isolated finding."
"Summary of Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy type II: Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy II (CHED II) is a rare subtype of posterior corneal dystrophy (see this term) characterized by a diffuse ground-glass appearance of the corneas and marked corneal thickening from birth with nystagmus, and blurred vision."
"Summary of Coronary artery aneurysm: Abnormal balloon- or sac-like dilatation in the wall of CORONARY VESSELS. Most coronary aneurysms are due to CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS, and the rest are due to inflammatory diseases, such as KAWASAKI DISEASE."
"Summary of Cowden syndrome: Cowden syndrome is an inherited condition that is characterized primarily by multiple, noncancerous growths (called hamartomas) on various parts of the body. People with the syndrome usually have large head (macrocephaly), benign tumors of the hair follicle (trichilemmomas), and white papules with a smooth surface in the mouth (papillomatous papules), starting by the late 20s. It is considered part of the PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome spectrum which also includes Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome and Proteus syndrome. People who have Cowden syndrome are at an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as breast, thyroid, and endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer. Most cases are caused by genetic changes in the PTEN gene and are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Cramp-fasciculation syndrome: Cramp-fasciculation syndrome (CFS) is a rare condition of the muscles characterized by persistent muscle cramping and twitching (fasciculations) in otherwise healthy individuals. This can lead to muscle discomfort, pain, or tiredness. Muscles in the leg are most commonly affected, although this condition may involve several parts of the body. Symptoms are thought to be due to over-activity of the associated nerves. In most cases, CFS occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Crouzon syndrome: Crouzon syndrome is a disorder characterized by early fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis). This prevents normal growth of the skull, which can affect the shape of the head and face. Signs and symptoms of Crouzon syndrome may include wide-set, bulging eyes; strabismus (misalignment of the eyes); a small, ""beak-shaped"" nose; and an underdeveloped upper jaw. Other features may include dental problems, hearing loss, and/or cleft lip and palate. The severity of signs and symptoms can vary among affected people, even within a family. Intelligence is usually normal, but intellectual disability may be present. Crouzon syndrome is caused by changes in the FGFR2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Craniosynostosis: Craniosynostosis is the premature closure of one or more of the joints that connect the bones of a baby's skull (cranial sutures). Normally, the bones remain separate until about age 2, while the brain is growing. They then fuse together and stay connected throughout life. The closure is premature when it occurs before brain growth is complete. Symptoms and severity vary depending on how many sutures close prematurely. For example, if only one closes prematurely (which is most common), brain growth may continue in other parts of the skull, leading only to an abnormally-shaped skull and no other health problems or complications. If multiple sutures close prematurely, brain growth can be restricted. This can lead to increased pressure in the skull, impaired brain development, seizures, blindness, and/or intellectual disability. Craniosynostosis may occur as a single abnormality (isolated Craniosynostosis) or it may occur as one feature of one of many syndromes. Most cases of isolated Craniosynostosis occur randomly (sporadically) and have no known cause. In some cases, isolated Craniosynostosis is due to a genetic change in any of several genes, with autosomal dominant inheritance. When Craniosynostosis is a feature of a larger syndrome (syndromic Craniosynostosis), the cause and inheritance pattern depend on the syndrome the person has. However, most syndromic causes of Craniosynostosis are autosomal dominant. Craniosynostosis can also be associated with a metabolic disease such as rickets, or hyperthyroidism. However, not all children with Craniosynostosis will need surgery. Children who have surgery and are otherwise healthy generally do not experience long-term complications, especially when only one suture is involved."
"Summary of Monosomy 5p: Monosomy 5p is present from birth and affects growth and development. Infants with this condition often have a high-pitched cat-like cry, small head size, and a characteristic facial appearance. They may have trouble breathing and feeding difficulties. People with this condition typically have intellectual disability, developmental and speech delay, and behavioral issues. Monosomy 5p is due to a missing piece (deletion) of a specific part of chromosome 5 known as the 'p' arm. In general, the severity of the symptoms is determined by the size and location of the deletion on chromosome 5. This deletion occurs very early in the development of an embryo and Monosomy 5p is usually not inherited in families. Diagnosis is based on the clinical examination, symptoms and confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Simple cryoglobulinemia: Simple cryoglobulinemia occurs when the body makes an abnormal immune system protein called a cryoglobulin. At temperatures less than 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (normal body temperature), cryoglobulins become solid or gel-like and can block blood vessels. This causes a variety of health problems. Many people with cryoglobulins will not experience any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may include skin ulcers, purple skin spots (purpura), numbness in the fingers and toes (Raynaud's phenomenon), joint pain, and kidney problems. The underlying cause is unknown. Simple cryoglobulinemia is typically associated with immune system cancers, such as multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is diagnosed based on the results of a clinical exam and the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood."
Summary of Cryptococcosis: A cosmopolitan fungal infection due to Cryptococcus neoformans.
"Summary of Cryptosporidiosis: Cryptosporidiosis is an illness caused by the parasite, Cryptosporidium. The condition is most commonly associated with watery diarrhea. Other signs and symptoms may include dehydration, weight loss, stomach cramps, fever, nausea and/or vomiting. Cryptosporidiosis occurs when the parasite enters the body, often through contaminated food and water or because of poor handwashing hygiene. Although Cryptosporidiosis can affect all people, young children, pregnant women and people with severely weakened immune systems (i.e. those with AIDS; cancer and transplant patients who are taking certain immunosuppressive drugs; and those with inherited diseases that affect the immune system) are likely to develop a more serious illness."
"Summary of Cushing syndrome: Cushing's syndrome is an endocrine disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissues to high levels of cortisol (a hormone produced by the adrenal gland). Signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include upper body obesity, fatigue, muscle weakness, high blood pressure, backache, high blood sugar, easy bruising and bluish-red stretch marks on the skin. Affected women may also experience irregular menstrual periods and increased growth of body and facial hair. This condition may be caused by a variety of factors including long-term use of corticosteroid medications, tumors in the pituitary gland or adrenal adenomas."
Summary of Rare cutaneous lupus erythematosus: Rare cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune disease that denotes a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical manifestations affecting the skin and can be divided into 4 categories: acute CLE (ACLE); subacute CLE (SCLE); chronic CLE (CCLE; the most diverse form); and intermittent CLE (ICLE). CLE can either occur alone or associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
"Summary of Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a group of disorders characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cancerous T-cells (a type of white blood cells) in the skin resulting in an itchy, red rash that can thicken or form a tumor. CTCLs belong to a larger group of disorders known asnon-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The most common types are mycosis fungoides and SÃ©zary syndrome. In some cases, cancerous T-cells may spread to the lymph nodes and eventually to other body tissues and organs, potentially resulting in serious complications. The specific signs and symptoms vary from person to person. The exact cause of these conditions is unknown."
"Summary of Cutis laxa: Cutis laxa is a connective tissue disorder characterized by skin that is sagging and not stretchy. The skin often hangs in loose folds, causing the face and other parts of the body to have a droopy appearance. Cutis laxa can also affect connective tissue in other parts of the body, including the heart, blood vessels, joints, intestines, and lungs. Depending on which organs and tissues are affected, the signs and symptoms can range from mild to serious. It may be acquired or inherited. The different forms of inherited Cutis laxa are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. In general, the autosomal recessive forms tend to be more severe than the autosomal dominant form. The X-linked form of Cutis laxa is often called occipital horn syndrome."
"Summary of Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita: Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (CMTC) is a birth defect involving the skin and blood vessels. It is characterized by patches of marbled-looking skin (cutis marmarota), small widened blood vessels under the skin (telangiectasia) and varicose veins (phlebectasia). The skin findings most often occur on the legs, but may also occur on the arms and trunk. The face is only rarely involved. CMTC usually only affects a specific area of the skin, although there have been a few cases of CMTC over the whole body. It may occasionally occur along with open sores (skin ulceration) or skin atrophy. The skin symptoms associated with CMTC generally improve with age. CMTC can occur alone or along with a variety of other birth defects, particularly those involving undergrowth or overgrowth of the same arm or leg. Most cases are thought to be sporadic (non-inherited), although rare cases have been observed in families."
"Summary of Cyclic neutropenia: Cyclic neutropenia is a rare blood disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of abnormally low levels of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in the body. Neutrophils are instrumental in fighting off infection by surrounding and destroying bacteria that enter the body. Symptoms of Cyclic neutropenia may include fever, a general feeling of ill health, and/or sores (ulcers) of the mucous membranes of the mouth. Individuals with low levels of neutrophils (neutropenia) are highly susceptible to recurrent infections. Cyclic neutropenia may be inherited or acquired. Some cases are present at birth and appear to occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadic). Inherited cases appear to be transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion and are caused by genetic changes in the ELANE gene."
"Summary of Cyclic vomiting syndrome: ""Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a condition characterized by recurrent, prolonged episodes of severe nausea and vomiting. Episodes of vomiting may last hours or days. Other signs and symptoms during episodes may include intense sweating, paleness, weakness and fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, dizziness, and headache. Most people with CVS are symptom-free in between episodes, but some people have milder symptoms. The condition can begin at any age, but it most often begins in childhood. A subset of people with CVS also have neurologic or neuromuscular disorders; the condition in these cases is referred to as """"CVS plus."""" The underlying cause of CVS is unknown. Data suggest there is a strong genetic component for CVS in children, involving changes in mitochondrial DNA. Many people with CVS report """"triggers"""" for episodes, such as excitement, stress, infections, eating certain foods, and menstruation. People with a family history of migraines may be more likely to develop CVS."""
Summary of Cystic adenomatoid malformation of lung: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes mucus to build up and damage organs in the body, particularly the lungs and pancreas. Signs and symptoms may include salty-tasting skin; persistent coughing; frequent lung infections; wheezing or shortness of breath; poor growth; weight loss; greasy, bulky stools; difficulty with bowel movements; and in males, infertility. Over time, mucus buildup and infections can lead to permanent lung damage, including the formation of scar tissue (fibrosis) and cysts in the lungs. CF is caused by genetic changes in the CFTR gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive."
Summary of Cystic hygroma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cystinosis: Cystinosis is a genetic condition present from birth that leads to the build-up of cystine crystals in the body. This can impact all the organs and tissues, but mainly affects the kidneys and eyes. The most common is the type that starts in infancy. Early symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, and dehydration. Kidney problems and vision problems may also develop. The adult form of Cystinosis primarily affects the eyes, causing light sensitivity. Cystinosis is caused by genetic changes (DNA variants) in the CTNS gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is diagnosed by checking for cystine levels in the blood, by genetic testing, or by an eye examination."
"Summary of Cystinuria: Cystinuria is an inherited condition characterized by a buildup of the amino acid, cystine, in the kidneys and bladder. This leads to the formation of cystine crystals and/or stones which may block the urinary tract. Signs and symptoms of the condition are related to the presence of stones and may include nausea, hematuria, flank pain, and/or frequent urinary tract infections. Cystinuria is caused by changes in the SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of D-minus hemolytic uremic syndrome (D-HUS): Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure caused by platelet thrombi in the microcirculation of the kidney and other organs. The onset of atypical HUS (aHUS) ranges from the neonatal period to adulthood. Genetic aHUS accounts for an estimated 60% of all aHUS. Individuals with genetic aHUS frequently experience relapse even after complete recovery following the presenting episode; 60% of genetic aHUS progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)."
Summary of D-plus hemolytic uremic syndrome (D+HUS): This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Isolated Dandy-Walker malformation: Dandy-Walker complex is a group of disorders that affect the development of the brain. The changes in brain development are present from birth (congenital). Dandy-Walker complex affects the formation of the area of the brain known as the cerebellum, which is responsible for coordinating movement, and the fluid-filled spaces around it. People with Dandy-Walker complex may have a portion of the brain called the cerebellar vermis that is smaller than expected (hypoplastic) or completely absent (aplastic). The cerebellar vermis is the area of the brain between the two halves of the cerebellum. People with Dandy-Walker complex have a larger than expected fourth ventricle of the brain. This ventricle allows fluid to flow between the upper and lower areas of the brain and spinal cord. People with Dandy-Walker complex may have an enlarged portion of the base of the skull (posterior fossa). Dandy-Walker complex may be more common in females than in males. Dandy-Walker complex is a group of disorders that have overlapping symptoms. These disorders include: Dandy-Walker malformation (also known as Dandy-Walker syndrome): having a small cerebellar vermis, large fourth ventricle, and enlarged posterior fossa   Isolated cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (sometimes known as Dandy-Walker variant): having a small cerebellar vermis without other features of Dandy-Walker complex   Mega-cisterna magna: having an enlarged posterior fossa with a typically developed cerebellum. This may be a normal variant and may not cause any health problems. In some cases, Dandy-Walker complex is caused by an underlying genetic change. These genetic changes may cause Dandy-Walker complex alone, or they may cause Dandy-Walker complex as well as other health problems. In these situations, the complex can run in families. However, in most situations, Dandy-Walker complex is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Dandy-Walker complex can be diagnosed by imaging of the brain such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI scan."
"Summary of Darier disease: Darier disease is a skin condition characterized by wart-like blemishes on the body. The blemishes are usually yellowish in color, hard to the touch, mildly greasy, and can emit a strong odor. The most common sites for blemishes are the scalp, forehead, upper arms, chest, back, knees, elbows, and behind the ear. The mucous membranes can also be affected, with blemishes on the roof of the mouth (palate), tongue, inside of the cheek, gums, and throat. Other features of Darier disease include nail abnormalities, such as red and white streaks in the nails with an irregular texture, and small pits in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The wart-like blemishes characteristic of Darier disease usually appear in late childhood to early adulthood. The severity of the disease varies over time; affected people experience flare-ups alternating with periods when they have fewer blemishes. The appearance of the blemishes is influenced by environmental factors. Most people with Darier disease will develop more blemishes during the summertime when they are exposed to heat and humidity. UV light; minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching; and ingestion of certain medications can also cause an increase in blemishes. On occasion, people with Darier disease may have neurological disorders such as mild intellectual disability, epilepsy, and depression. Learning and behavior difficulties have also been reported in people with Darier disease. A form of Darier disease known as the linear or segmental form is characterized by blemishes on localized areas of the skin. The blemishes are not as widespread as they are in typical Darier disease. Some people with the linear form of this condition have the nail abnormalities that are seen in people with classic Darier disease, but these abnormalities occur only on one side of the body. This disease summary is from MedlinePlus Genetics, an online health information resource from the National Institutes of Health."
Summary of Malignant atrophic papulosis: Degos disease is a rare blood vessel disorder. This slows or stops the flow of blood through the affected vessels. Severity of symptoms depends on the extent and location of the affected blood vessels. Some individuals with Degos disease have isolated skin involvement and develop porcelain-white macules on their skin. Other individuals have more wide spread disease. The cause of this condition is currently unknown.
"Summary of Dengue fever: Dengue fever (DF), caused by dengue virus, is an arboviral disease characterized by an initial non-specific febrile illness that can sometimes progress to more severe forms manifesting capillary leakage and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever, or DHF) and shock (dengue shock syndrome, or DSS)."
"Summary of Calcifying Epithelial Odontogenic Tumor: A slow growing, locally invasive neoplasm arising from tooth-forming tissues. It most often grows intraosseously in the mandible and less frequently in the maxilla. In a minority of cases it grows extraosseously in the gingiva. It is characterized by the presence of a fibrous stroma, epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and amyloid material which is often calcified. Small tumors may be successfully treated with enucleation. Local resection is usually required for larger tumors. Recurrences have been reported in a minority of cases."
"Summary of Dentinogenesis imperfecta: Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a condition characterized by teeth that are translucent and discolored (most often blue-grey or yellow-brown in color). Individuals with this disorder tend to have teeth that are weaker than normal, which leads to wear, breakage, and loss of teeth. This damage can include teeth fractures or small holes (pitting) in the enamel. Dentinogenesis imperfecta can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. People with this condition may also have speech problems or teeth that are not placed correctly in the mouth. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is caused by genetic changes in the DSPP gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. According to the original classification, there are three types of dentinogenesis imperfecta: Type I: occurs in people who have osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition in which bones are brittle, causing them to break easily. People with this type of Dentinogenesis imperfecta have genetic changes in COL1A1 or COL1A2. Type II: usually occurs in people without another inherited disorder. Some families with type II also have progressive hearing loss in older age. Type II is the most common type of dentinogenesis imperfecta. Type III: usually occurs in people without another inherited disorder. Type III was first identified in a group of families in southern Maryland and has also been seen in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent."
Summary of Depersonalization/derealization disorder: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Dermatomyositis: Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune condition that causes skin changes and muscle weakness. Symptoms can include a red skin rash around the eyelids, red bumps around the joints, and muscle weakness in the arms and legs. Muscle weakness gets worse over time and can lead to stiff joints and muscle wasting. The cause for Dermatomyositis is unknown. Diagnosis is made through a clinical exam and microscopic examination of a piece of skin and muscle."
"Summary of Desmoplastic small round cell tumor: Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare type of soft tissue cancer (sarcoma) that usually begins in the abdomen. It primarily affects children and young adults and is more common in males. It is formed by small, round cancer cells surrounded by scar-like tissue and is often found in the tissue (peritoneum) that lines the inside of the abdomen and pelvis. The tumor cells have a characteristic genetic change involving a translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22, which is important in differentiating from other similar tumors. The genetic change involved in DSRCT is acquired throughout a person's lifetime and is not inherited. Symptoms may include abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness, abdominal mass, and symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction, such as constipation."
"Summary of Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) affect the spinal cord and optic nerves (nerves that carry visual messages to and from the brain). Symptoms include pain, weakness, bowel and bladder problems, and temporary vision loss. NMOSD usually occurs in adulthood, but symptoms may start at any age. Some people have a single attack of symptoms lasting months, but in most people the symptoms come and go over time. People with NMOSD may develop permanent muscle weakness and vision loss. The cause of NMOSD is unknown. It occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the spinal cord and eyes. It can be diagnosed by a clinical exam, MRI looking for specific signs, and blood tests looking for certain antibodies."
"Summary of Dextrocardia with situs inversus: Dextrocardia with situs inversus is a condition that is characterized by abnormal positioning of the heart and other internal organs. In people affected by dextrocardia, the tip of the heart points towards the right side of the chest instead of the left side. Situs inversus refers to the mirror-image reversal of the organs in the chest and abdominal cavity. Some affected people have no obvious signs or symptoms. Dextrocardia with situs inversus can also be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (also known as Kartagener syndrome)."
"Summary of Blackfan-Diamond anemia: Blackfan-Diamond anemia is an inherited blood disorder that affects the ability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. In some cases there is also short stature. Blackfan-Diamond anemia is caused by genetic changes in several genes, some of which have been identified and some of which have not. Identified genes include but are not limited to: RPS19, RPL5, RPS10, RPL11, RPL35A, RPS7, RPS17, RPS24, RPS26 and GATA1 genes. Patients with genetic changes in the RPL5 gene have more serious symptoms and about 45% have cleft palate and are smaller than average size. Patients with genetic changes in the RPL11 gene have thumb anomalies more frequently than people with the other types. Genetic changes in the GATA1 gene are associated with severe anemia. Most cases are isolated, but about 45% of people with Blackfan-Diamond anemia inherit this condition from a parent. Inheritance is typically autosomal dominant , but can rarely be X-linked. The severity of the disease is very varied."
"Summary of Diastrophic dysplasia: Diastrophic dysplasia is a disorder of cartilage and bone development. Diastrophic dysplasia is characterized by shortened arms and legs, spinal deformities, hitchhiker thumbs, joint contractures, and joint pain (osteoarthritis). Mental development and intelligence are usually normal. Surgical correction of clubfoot may be necessary. Arthroplasty of the hips and knees to decrease pain and increase motility may also be indicated. Indications for surgical correction of scoliosis have not yet been established. Diastrophic dysplasia is caused by genetic changes in the SLC26A2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Diencephalic syndrome: Diencephalic syndrome is a condition caused by a tumor located in a portion of the brain above the brainstem called the diencephalon. The diencephalon includes the hypothalamus and the thalamus. This condition is usually found in infants and young children and may result in symptoms including failure to gain weight and grow normally (failure to thrive), progressive thinness and weakness (emaciation), and hyperactivity and restlessness (hyperkinesia). Other symptoms may include abnormal eye movements and vision issues, vomiting, and hydrocephalus. Diencephalic syndrome is most commonly caused by astrocytomas; however, other types of tumors may be associated including ependymoma, dysgerminoma, and ganglioma. Given their location, these tumors may cause symptoms by leading to abnormal functioning of the hypothalamus and optic nerve."
Summary of Doxorubicin induced cardiomyopathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Dracunculiasis: Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) characterized by a painful burning skin lesion from which the Dracunculus medinensis parasite emerges approximately 1 year after infection resulting from consumption of unsafe drinking water containing parasite-infected copepods (Cyclops spp., microcrustacea also called water fleas)."
"Summary of Duane retraction syndrome: ""Duane syndrome affects the ability of the eye to move from side to side. Symptoms include restricted movement of eye outward and/or inward and the eyeball may be pulled back into the socket. In addition, the opening of the eye may be narrow. Some people with Duane syndrome develop """"lazy eye"""" (amblyopia), a condition that may cause vision loss in the affected eye. Duane syndrome usually only occurs in one eye, and is not associated with other signs or symptoms. There are three types of Duane syndrome, which vary by which eye movements are most severely restricted. The exact cause of Duane syndrome is unknown. About 10% of cases are inherited in families in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis of Duane syndrome is based on the symptoms, an eye exam, and imaging studies."""
"Summary of Dubowitz syndrome: Dubowitz syndrome is a very rare genetic and developmental disorder with a broad range of signs and symptoms. The typical findings of Dubowitz syndrome include growth failure/short stature, characteristic facial features such as a small triangular face, high sloping forehead, drooping eyelid (ptosis), short eyelids, increased distance between eyes (hypertelorism) broad and flat nasal bridge with a prominent and rounded nasal tip, smaller than normal head (microcephaly), intellectual disability, and eczema, especially on the face and behind the knees. Other common findings are behavioral disorders (hyperactivity, and/or autistic features), speech alterations, scanty or absent hair, foot abnormalities, delayed bone age, bone defects of the lower part of the spine (sacrum and coccyx), testicles that are still not located in the scrotum (cryptorchidism), memory and / or learning problems. There may be an increased risk of having cancer such as leukemia, or lymphoma. The diagnosis is made based on the symptoms (specially the facial features), but there is no specific laboratory test. The cause is still unknown, but, some people who are diagnosed with the syndrome may have variants  in the NSUN2 and LIG4 genes, or have loss or gain of microscopic material in some chromosomes (chromosomal microdeletions or microduplications)."
"Summary of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) affects the muscles, leading to muscle wasting that gets worse over time. DMD occurs primarily in males, though in rare cases may affect females. The symptoms of DMD include progressive weakness and loss (atrophy) of both skeletal and heart muscle. Early signs may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable in early childhood. DMD is caused by genetic changes (DNA variants) in the DMD gene. DMD is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern and may occur in people who do not have a family history of DMD. Diagnosis of DMD is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and the result of a biopsy to remove a small piece of muscle for examination under a microscope. The result of genetic testing may also help confirm the diagnosis. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), a milder form of muscular dystrophy, is also caused by genetic changes in the DMD gene."
Summary of Dwarfism Levi type: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen disease: Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen (DMC) syndrome is a rare, progressive genetic condition characterized by abnormal skeletal development, microcephaly, and intellectual disability. Only about 100 cases have been reported to date. Skeletal abnormalities may include a barrel-shaped chest with a short trunk, partial dislocation of the hips, knock knees, bowlegs, and decreased joint mobility. A small number of affected individuals experience instability in the upper neck vertebrae that can lead to spinal cord compression, weakness and paralysis. Normally, there is growth deficiency resulting in short stature. DMC is caused by genetic changes in the DYM gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Dyskeratosis congenita, autosomal dominant 1: Dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a telomere biology disorder, is characterized by a classic triad of dysplastic nails, lacy reticular pigmentation of the upper chest and/or neck, and oral leukoplakia. The classic triad may not be present in all individuals. People with DC are at increased risk for progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), solid tumors (usually squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck or anogenital cancer), and pulmonary fibrosis. Other findings can include: abnormal pigmentation changes not restricted to the upper chest and neck, eye abnormalities (epiphora, blepharitis, sparse eyelashes, ectropion, entropion, trichiasis), and dental abnormalities (caries, periodontal disease, taurodauntism). Although most persons with DC have normal psychomotor development and normal neurologic function, significant developmental delay is present in the two variants in which additional findings include cerebellar hypoplasia (Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome) and bilateral exudative retinopathy and intracranial calcifications (Revesz syndrome). Onset and progression of manifestations of DC vary: at the mild end of the spectrum are those who have only minimal physical findings with normal bone marrow function, and at the severe end are those who have the diagnostic triad and early-onset BMF."
"Summary of Dyskeratosis congenita, autosomal recessive 1: Dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a telomere biology disorder, is characterized by a classic triad of dysplastic nails, lacy reticular pigmentation of the upper chest and/or neck, and oral leukoplakia.

"Summary of Autosomal recessive generalized dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, severe form: Severe generalized recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is the most severe types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. The signs and symptoms of this condition involve widespread blistering that can lead to vision loss, disfigurement, and other serious medical problems. As the blisters heal, they result in severe scarring. Scarring in the mouth and esophagus can make it difficult to eat food, leading to poor nutrition and slow growth. Additionally, individuals with this condition have a very high risk of developing a form of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma, which tends to be unusually aggressive. Severe generalized recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is caused by genetic changes in the COL7A1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Eales disease: Eales disease is a rare vision disorder that appears as an inflammation and white haze around the outercoat of the veins in the retina. This condition is most common among young males and normally affects both eyes. In most cases, vision becomes suddenly blurred because the vitreous, the clear jelly that fills the eyeball behind the lens of the eye, seeps out."
"Summary of Ebstein malformation of the tricuspid valve: Ebstein malformation of the tricuspid valve is a rare heart defect in which parts of the tricuspid valve (which separates the right ventricle from the right atrium) are abnormal. The abnormality causes the tricuspid valve to leak blood backwards into the right atrium. The backup of blood flow can lead to heart swelling and fluid buildup in the lungs or liver. Sometimes, not enough blood gets out of the heart into the lungs and the person may appear blue. Symptoms range from mild to very severe."
Summary of Eccentrochondrodysplasia: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Eclampsia: A potentially life-threatening pregnancy-related disorder characterized by tonic-clonic seizures in association with hypertension after the twentieth week of gestation and up to six weeks postpartum and in the absence of other potential causes of seizures.
"Summary of Ectodermal dysplasia syndrome: Ectodermal dysplasias (ED) are a group of more than 180 disorders that affect the outer layer of tissue of the embryo (ectoderm) that helps make up the skin, sweat glands, hair, teeth, and nails. Symptoms of ED can range from mild to severe and may include teeth abnormalities; brittle, sparse or absent hair; abnormal fingernails; inability to perspire (hypohidrosis); various skin problems; and other symptoms. Different types of EDs are caused by genetic changes in different genes, and can be inherited in a variety of ways."
Summary of Ectopic pregnancy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Isolated split hand-split foot malformation: Split hand foot malformation (SHFM) is a type of birth defect that consists of missing digits (fingers and/or toes), a deep cleft down the center of the hand or foot, and fusion of remaining digits. The severity of this condition varies widely among affected individuals. SHFM is sometimes called ectrodactyly; however, this is a nonspecific term used to describe missing digits. SHFM may occur by itself (isolated) or it may be part of a syndrome with abnormalities in other parts of the body. At least six different forms of isolated SHFM have been described. Each type is associated with a different underlying genetic cause. SHFM1 has been linked to chromosome 7, and SHFM2 is linked to the X chromosome. SHFM3 is caused by a duplication of chromosome 10 at position 10q24. Changes in the TP63 gene cause SHFM4. SHFM5 is linked to chromosome 2, and SHFM6 is caused by genetic changes in the WNT10B gene. SHFM may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner."
"Summary of Trisomy 18: Trisomy 18 is a chromosome disorder characterized by having 3 copies of chromosome 18 instead of the usual 2 copies. Signs and symptoms include severe intellectual disability; low birth weight; a small, abnormally shaped head; a small jaw and mouth; clenched fists with overlapping fingers; congenital heart defects; and various abnormalities of other organs. Most cases are not inherited and occur sporadically (by chance)."
"Summary of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of inherited connective tissue disorders caused by abnormalities in the structure, production, and/or processing of collagen. The symptoms of EDS vary by type and range from mildly loose joints to serious complications. Features shared by many types include joint hypermobility and soft, velvety skin that is highly elastic (stretchy) and bruises easily. Genetic changes in a variety of genes may lead to EDS. However, the underlying genetic cause in some families is unknown. Depending on the type, EDS may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Eisenmenger syndrome: Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) refers to the combination of a type of high blood pressure that affects the blood vessels of the lungs and heart (pulmonary hypertension), and abnormal blood flow through the heart. ES most often occurs in people who are born with a heart defect (congenital heart defect) that does not get repaired in childhood. The most common type of heart defect associated with Eisenmenger syndrome is a âhole in the heart' or ventricular septal defect, but other types of heart defects can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome. The symptoms include blueish skin color (cyanosis), rounded fingers and toes (clubbing), and shortness of breath. The symptoms of ES typically get worse over time. Eisenmenger syndrome is not inherited in families. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms in a person with a heart defect that has not been repaired."
Summary of Elective mutism: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a condition that affects the joints, muscles, and heart. Joint symptoms tend to present in childhood and involve contractures of the elbows, ankles, and neck. By adulthood, most people with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy develop heart problems, such as conduction defects and arrhythmias. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is caused by genetic changes in the EMD and LMNA genes. It can be inherited in an X-linked, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Empty sella syndrome: Empty sella syndrome (ESS) is a condition that involves the sella turcica, a bony structure at the base of the brain that protects the pituitary gland. There is a primary and secondary form of the condition. The primary form occurs when a structural defect above the pituitary gland increases pressure in the sella turcica and causes the gland to flatten. The secondary form occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged due to injury, a tumor, surgery or radiation therapy. Some people with ESS have no symptoms. People with secondary ESS may have symptoms of decreased pituitary function such as absence of menstruation, infertility, fatigue, and intolerance to stress and infection. In children, ESS may be associated with early onset of puberty, growth hormone deficiency, pituitary tumors, or pituitary gland dysfunction."
"Summary of Encephalitis lethargica: Encephalitis lethargica (EL) is a disease characterized by high fever, headache, double vision, delayed physical and mental response, extreme tiredness (lethargy), and sometimes coma. Patients may also experience abnormal eye movements, upper body weakness, muscle pain, tremors, neck rigidity, and behavioral changes including psychosis. A worldwide epidemic of EL occurred from 1917 to 1928 with more than one million reported cases. Although occasional cases are reported with similar symptoms, EL epidemics have not recurred. The cause of this condition is unknown, but a viral origin is suspected. Levodopa and other antiparkinson drugs may be effective in alleviating some symptoms."
"Summary of Isolated encephalocele: Encephaloceles are rare neural tube defects characterized by sac-like protrusions of the brain and the membranes that cover it through openings in the skull. These defects are caused by failure of the neural tube to close completely during fetal development. The result is a groove down the midline of the upper part of the skull, or the area between the forehead and nose, or the back of the skull. When located in the back of the skull, Encephaloceles are often associated with neurological problems. Encephaloceles are usually dramatic deformities diagnosed immediately after birth; but occasionally a small Encephalocele in the nasal and forehead region can go undetected. There is a genetic component to the condition; it often occurs in families with a history of spina bifida and anencephaly in other family members."
Summary of Enchondroma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Endocardial fibroelastosis: A condition characterized by the thickening of ENDOCARDIUM due to proliferation of fibrous and elastic tissue, usually in the left ventricle leading to impaired cardiac function (CARDIOMYOPATHY, RESTRICTIVE). It is most commonly seen in young children and rarely in adults. It is often associated with congenital heart anomalies (HEART DEFECTS CONGENITAL;) INFECTION; or gene mutation. Defects in the tafazzin protein, encoded by TAZ gene, result in a form of autosomal dominant familial endocardial fibroelastosis."
"Summary of Infective endocarditis: ""Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers (endocardium) and valves. This condition is sometimes called """"endocarditis,"""" although it is important to distinguish it from non-Infective endocarditis. IE is caused by bacteria, fungi, or other germs invading the bloodstream and attaching to the heart. IE can damage the heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications. It can develop quickly or slowly depending on what type of germ is causing it and whether there is an underlying heart problem. Common symptoms of IE are fever and other flu-like symptoms, but signs and symptoms can vary. It can also cause problems in many other parts of the body besides the heart."""
"Summary of Endometrial stromal sarcoma: Endometrial stromal sarcoma is a rare form of cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in the uterus. Endometrial stromal sarcoma, specifically, develops in the supporting connective tissue (stroma) of the uterus. Signs and symptoms of the condition include abnormal uterine bleeding (i.e. bleeding that is not part of menstrual periods or bleeding after menopause); abdominal pain and/or distension; and frequent urination. The exact underlying cause of Endometrial stromal sarcoma is currently unknown. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."

"Summary of Eosinophilic cryptitis: Transmural inflammation of the bladder predominantly with eosinophils, associated with fibrosis with or without muscle necrosis. [PMID:15857336, PMID:28829677]"
Summary of Eosinophilic cystitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Eosinophilic fasciitis: Eosinophilic fasciitis is a very rare condition in which muscle tissue underneath the skin, called fascia, becomes swollen and thick. Rapid swelling can occur in the hands, arms, legs, and feet. People with this condition have a buildup of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the affected fascia and muscles. The exact cause of this condition is unknown. Corticosteroids and other immune-suppressing medications are used to relieve the symptoms. Eosinophilic fasciitis is similar in appearance to scleroderma. However, in contrast with systemic sclerosis, internal organ involvement in Eosinophilic fasciitis is generally absent."
"Summary of Embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes: A highly malignant embryonal tumor of infancy and young childhood characterized by neuroectodermal elements organized in distinctive multilayered rosettes. Ependymoblastomas are large lesions that occur in the supratentorial compartment, typically displaying a physical connection to the ventricular system."
"Summary of Ependymoma: Ependymomas are rare glial tumors of the brain and spinal cord (Yokota et al., 2003)."
"Summary of Venezuelan equine encephalitis: A condition caused by infection by the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, which is characterized by headache, fever, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting."
Summary of Epidermodysplasia verruciformis: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a rare inherited genodermatosis characterized by chronic infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) leading to polymorphous cutaneous lesions and high risk of developing non melanoma skin cancer.
"Summary of Epidermolysis bullosa: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of genetic skin diseases that cause the skin to blister and erode very easily. In people with EB, blisters form in response to minor injuries or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. There are four main types of EB, which are classified based on the depth, or level, of blister formation: Epidermolysis bullosa simplex   Dystrophic Epidermolysis bullosa       Junctional Epidermolysis bullosa       Kindler Syndrome  EB may then be further classified based on severity and specific symptoms, such as distribution (localized or generalized) and whether parts of the body other than the skin are affected. Specific sub-types may then be determined based on identifying the exact protein that is defective in a person with EB. This may be done by tests performed on a skin biopsy, or when possible, genetic testing. Identifying the exact sub-type can be hard because there are many sub-types of EB. A person with any main type of EB may be mildly or severely affected, and the disease can range from being a minor inconvenience requiring modifying activities, to completely disabling and even fatal in some cases. EB may be caused by changes in at least 18 genes that play various roles in the structure, integrity, and repair of the skin. Inheritance may be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive depending on the type and subtype of EB a person has."
"Summary of Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes the skin to blister in response to minor injury. Common areas of blistering include the hands, feet, knees, elbows, and buttocks. It can also affect the mouth, nose, and eyes. Some affected people have other health problems such as Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, amyloidosis, or multiple myeloma. EBA is not inherited and usually occurs in adulthood. Immunosuppressive drugs may be used to reduce the body's autoimmune response."
"Summary of Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma: A malignant neoplasm which occurs mostly in the major salivary glands (most frequently in the parotid gland), but also in the minor salivary glands of the oral mucosa and the tracheobronchial tree. It is characterized by the presence of ductal structures which are lined by an inner layer of cuboidal epithelial-type cells and an outer layer of myoepithelial cells with clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm."
"Summary of Erdheim-Chester disease: Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare condition that can affect many parts of the body. It has been diagnosed in children, but it most commonly affects adults. ECD causes the over-production of immune cells called histiocytes, which then accumulate in tissues and organs in the body. Parts of the body that may be involved include the long bones, retroperitoneum, skin, eyes and eyelids, lungs, brain, heart, kidneys, and pituitary gland; however various other tissues or organs can be affected. The signs and symptoms of ECD vary from person to person depending upon the specific locations and extent of involvement. For example, the long bones of the legs are commonly affected, leading to bone pain. When tissues around the eyes are affected, a person may have soft, fatty bumps on the eyelids or protrusion of the eyeballs. Lung involvement may cause pulmonary fibrosis, which can lead to severe complications. People with pituitary gland involvement may develop diabetes insipidus, and brain involvement may lead to various neurologic symptoms. Non-specific symptoms that may develop in people with ECD include weight loss, fever, muscle and joint aches, and malaise. The underlying cause of ECD is not always known. Some people with ECD test positive for an acquired (non-inherited) genetic change in the BRAF gene (most commonly) or one of several other genes, which may allow histiocytes to reproduce uncontrollably. The disease is diagnosed based on the symptoms, biopsies of involved tissue examined under a microscope (pathology), and specialized tests that may include blood tests and imaging studies such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and bone scans."
"Summary of Erysipelas: An acute infection of the skin caused by species of STREPTOCOCCUS. This disease most frequently affects infants, young children, and the elderly. Characteristics include pink-to-red lesions that spread rapidly and are warm to the touch. The commonest site of involvement is the face."
"Summary of Erythema multiforme: Erythema multiforme (EM) refers to a group of hypersensitivity disorders characterized by symmetric red, patchy lesions, primarily on the arms and legs. The cause is unknown, but EM frequently occurs in association with herpes simplex virus, suggesting an immunologic process initiated by the virus. In half of the cases, the triggering agents appear to be medications, including anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other antibiotics. In addition, some cases appear to be associated with infectious organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and many viral agents. Erythema multiforme is the mildest of three skin disorders that are often discussed in relation to each other. It is generally the mildest of the three. More severe is Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The most severe of the three is toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)."
"Summary of Primary erythromelalgia: Erythromelalgia (EM) is a rare condition characterized by episodes of burning pain, warmth, swelling and redness in parts of the body, particularly the hands and feet. This condition may occur spontaneously (primary EM) or secondary to neurological diseases, autoimmune diseases, or myeloproliferative disorders (secondary EM). Episodes may be triggered by increased body temperature, alcohol, and eating spicy foods. About 15% of cases are caused by genetic changes in the SCN9A gene and are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Other cases may be caused by unidentified genes or by non-genetic factors."
"Summary of Erythroplakia: A clinical term that refers to the presence of a red flat and well defined lesion on the oral mucosa that is not caused by trauma, vascular, or inflammatory processes. It is a precancerous condition and is seen more commonly in middle aged or older males. It is associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption. Microscopic examination reveals severe epithelial dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or invasive squamous cell carcinoma."
"Summary of Esophageal atresia: Oesophageal atresia (OA) encompasses a group of congenital anomalies with an interruption in the continuity of the oesophagus, with or without persistent communication with the trachea."
"Summary of Carcinoma of esophagus: Esophageal cancer is a cancer of the esophagus, the hollow tube that carries foods and liquids from the throat to the stomach. Symptoms that may develop as the cancer grows include heartburn, pain when swallowing, difficulty swallowing, a hoarse voice, a cough that does not go away, weight loss, and coughing up blood. The exact cause of Esophageal cancer usually is not known, but both environmental and genetic factors are thought to play a role in its development. For example, variationss in any of several genes may cause susceptibility to Esophageal cancer. Environmental factors that may increase a person's chance to develop Esophageal cancer include tobacco use, heavy alcohol use, older age, obesity, and damage to the esophagus from acid reflux (Barrett esophagus). The diagnosis may be based on imaging studies and tests such as chest X-ray, upper endoscopy, and a biopsy of tissue from the esophagus."
Summary of Esophageal varices: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis: Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis occurs when the body makes a mix of abnormal immune system proteins called cryoglobulins. At temperatures less than 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (normal body temperature), cryoglobulins become solid or gel-like and can block blood vessels. This causes a variety of health problems. Many people with cryoglobulins will not experience any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include purplish discolored skin (purpura), weakness, joint pain, liver disease, and kidney problems. The underlying cause is unknown. Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is typically associated with a chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. It is diagnosed based on the results of a clinical exam and the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood."
"Summary of Evans syndrome: Evans syndrome is a very rare autoimmune disorder in which the immune system destroys the body's red blood cells, white blood cells and/or platelets. Affected people often experience thrombocytopenia (too few platelets) and Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia (premature destruction of red blood cells). Signs and symptoms may include purpura, paleness, fatigue, and light-headedness. The exact cause of this condition is unknown."
"Summary of Skeletal Ewing sarcoma: Skeletal Ewing sarcoma is a type of cancerous tumor that mainly affects children and young adults. Skeletal Ewing sarcoma usually occurs in the long bones of the arms and legs, pelvis, or chest. Symptoms may include swelling over the location of the tumor, and pain which gets worse over time. Other symptoms may depend on the size and location of the tumor. Skeletal Ewing sarcoma can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize), and other symptoms may develop such as fever, night sweats, and tiredness. The cause of Skeletal Ewing sarcoma is unknown. Diagnosis is based on a clinical examination, health history, imaging studies, and blood tests. A biopsy to examine a small piece of the tumor under a microscope is also often done."
Summary of Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Exfoliative dermatitis: A generalized inflammatory cutaneous disorder characterized by erythema and desquamation.
Summary of Exogenous lipoid pneumonia: Pneumonia due to aspiration or inhalation of various oily or fatty substances.
"Summary of Bladder exstrophy: A congenital genitourinary malformation belonging to the spectrum of the exstrophy-epispadias complex (EEC) and is characterized by an evaginated bladder plate, epispadias and an anterior defect of the pelvis, pelvic floor and abdominal wall."
"Summary of Fabry disease: Fabry disease is a type of lysosomal storage disease. Lysosomes are round structures found in the cells of the body that are full of special proteins called enzymes. Lysosomal enzymes help breakdown other proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and other substances. In Fabry disease, there is not enough of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase (alpha-GAL). Alpha-GAL helps breakdown a fatty acid called ""globotriaosylceramide"" or GL3 "". Without enough alpha-GAL, the lysosomes become filled with GL-3 and can not work well.  Symptoms of Fabry disease may include episodes of pain, especially in the hands and feet, clusters of small, dark red spots on the skin called angiokeratomas, a decreased ability to sweat (hypohidrosis), cloudiness of the front part of the eye (corneal opacity), and hearing loss. Internal organs, such as the kidney, heart or brain, may also be affected, leading to progressive kidney damage, heart attacks, and strokes. Milder forms of Fabry disease may appear later in life and affect only the heart or kidneys.  Fabry disease is caused by certain changes (pathogenic variants, also called genetic changes) in the GLA gene. Since the GLA gene is located on the X chromosome, Fabry disease is inherited in an X-linked manner. Although an enzyme assay test measuring the activity of alpha-GAL can diagnose Fabry disease in males, diagnosis is usually made by genetic testing in both males and females."
Summary of Factor V Leiden thrombophilia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Congenital factor X deficiency: Factor X deficiency is a rare disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot. The severity of the disorder and the associated signs and symptoms can vary significantly from person to person. Common features of Factor X deficiency may include easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in the urine, and prolonged bleeding after minor injuries. Women with Factor X deficiency may also experience heavy menstrual bleeding and may have an increased risk for first trimester miscarriages. Acquired (non-inherited) Factor X deficiency, which is the most common form of the disorder, generally occurs in people with no family history of the disorder. Acquired Factor X deficiency has a variety of causes including liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, exposure to certain medications that affect clotting, and certain types of cancer. The inherited form of Factor X deficiency (also called congenital Factor X deficiency) is caused by changes in the F10 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Factor X deficiency can be diagnosed based on the symptoms and through laboratory tests to measure clotting time."
"Summary of Acquired hemophilia A: Acquired hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder that interferes with the body's blood clotting process. Signs and symptoms include prolonged bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, bruising throughout the body, solid swellings of congealed blood (hematomas), hematuria, and gastrointestinal or urologic bleeding. Acquired hemophilia A occurs when the body's immune system attacks and disables a certain protein that helps the blood clot (called coagulation factor VIII). About half of the cases are associated with other conditions, such as pregnancy, autoimmune disease, cancer, skin diseases, or allergic reactions to medications."
"Summary of Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis: Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by calcium deposits in the basal ganglia, a part of the brain that helps start and control movement. The first symptoms often include clumsiness, fatigue, unsteady walking (gait), slow or slurred speech, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and dementia. Migraines and seizures frequently occur. Genetic changes in the SLC20A2, PDGFRB, and PDGFB genes have been found to cause Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Familial adenomatous polyposis: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) leads to the growth of hundreds to thousands of non-cancerous (benign) polyps in the colon and rectum. Symptoms of FAP may include dental abnormalities, tumors of the connective tissue (desmoid tumors), and benign and malignant tumors of the duodenum (a section of the small intestine), liver, bones, skin, and other tissues. People with AFAP have an increased risk of developing colon cancer at a later age than classic FAP. FAP is due to genetic variants in the APC gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. FAP is diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical examination, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Familial deafness: Nonsyndromic hearing loss is a partial or total loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. In contrast, syndromic hearing loss occurs with signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body.Nonsyndromic hearing loss can be classified in several different ways. One common way is by the condition's pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant (DFNA), autosomal recessive (DFNB), X-linked (DFNX), or mitochondrial (which does not have a special designation). Each of these types of hearing loss includes multiple subtypes. DFNA, DFNB, and DFNX subtypes are numbered in the order in which they were first described. For example, DFNA1 was the first type of autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss to be identified.The characteristics of nonsyndromic hearing loss vary among the different types. Hearing loss can affect one ear (unilateral) or both ears (bilateral). Degrees of hearing loss range from mild (difficulty understanding soft speech) to profound (inability to hear even very loud noises). The term \""deafness\"" is often used to describe severe-to-profound hearing loss. Hearing loss can be stable, or it may be progressive, becoming more severe as a person gets older. Particular types of nonsyndromic hearing loss show distinctive patterns of hearing loss. For example, the loss may be more pronounced at high, middle, or low tones.Most forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss are described as sensorineural, which means they are associated with a permanent loss of hearing caused by damage to structures in the inner ear. The inner ear processes sound and sends the information to the brain in the form of electrical nerve impulses. Less commonly, nonsyndromic hearing loss is described as conductive, meaning it results from changes in the middle ear. The middle ear contains three tiny bones that help transfer sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. Some forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss, particularly a type called DFNX2, involve changes in both the inner ear and the middle ear. This combination is called mixed hearing loss.Depending on the type, nonsyndromic hearing loss can become apparent at any time from infancy to old age. Hearing loss that is present before a child learns to speak is classified as prelingual or congenital. Hearing loss that occurs after the development of speech is classified as postlingual."
"Summary of Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (Hyperlipoproteinemia type 1) is an inherited condition that disrupts the normal breakdown of fats in the body, causing a large amount of fat to build up in the blood. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), abdominal pain, enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and small yellow skin lesions called eruptive xanthomas. Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the LPL gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
Summary of Hyperlipoproteinemia type 4: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Familial Mediterranean fever: Familial Mediterranean fever is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of painful inflammation in the abdomen, chest, or joints. These episodes are often accompanied by fever and sometimes a rash or headache. Occasionally inflammation may occur in other parts of the body, such as the heart; the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord; and in males, the testicles. In about half of affected individuals, attacks are preceded by mild signs and symptoms known as a prodrome. Prodromal symptoms include mildly uncomfortable sensations in the area that will later become inflamed, or more general feelings of discomfort. Typically, episodes last 12 to 72 hours and can vary in severity. The length of time between attacks is also variable and can range from days to years. During these periods, affected individuals usually have no signs or symptoms related to the condition."
"Summary of Familial periodic paralysis: Familial periodic paralysis is a disease characterized by sudden attacks of weakness and paralysis. Weakness is recurrent, affecting mainly the limbs, and is often brought on by exercising or eating too many or too few carbohydrates. There are 4 forms of Familial periodic paralysis: hypokalemic, hyperkalemic, thyrotoxic, and Andersen-Tawil syndrome. In the hypokalemic form, the paralysis is caused by low levels of potassium. In the hyperkalemic form, the paralysis is caused by high levels of potassium in the blood. In the thyrotoxic form, the paralysis is caused by low levels of potassium in the blood and an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). In Andersen-Tawil syndrome, potassium levels can be high, low, or normal. Genetic changes in the CACNA1S and SCN4A genes cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis. The hyperkalemic form is due to genetic changes in SCN4A gene. The underlying cause of the thyrotoxic form is unknown. Genetic changes in the KCNJ2 gene cause Andersen-Tawil syndrome."
"Summary of Fanconi anemia: Fanconi anemia (FA) affects the way genetic information (DNA) is copied and repaired. FA leads to bone marrow failure, skeletal abnormalities, and an increased risk for cancer. People with FA have a decreased number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets leading to anemia, frequent infections, and excessive bleeding. In addition, people with FA may have limb, kidney, eye, skin, and genitourinary tract abnormalities. FA occurs due to variations in one of at least 22 genes. It is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, but it may also be inherited in an autosomal dominant or X-linked recessive pattern. FA can be diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical exam, laboratory testing. The diagnosis may be confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Farber disease: Farber disease is an inherited lipid storage disease in which an excess amount of fat builds up in the joints, tissues, and central nervous system. Symptoms of Farber disease include a hoarse voice or weak cry, small lumps of fat under the skin and in other tissues (lipogranulomas), and swollen and painful joints. Other symptoms may include difficulty breathing, an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and developmental delay. The symptoms tend to get worse over time and lead to a shortened lifespan. There are multiple types of Farber disease classified by the severity and nervous system involvement. Farber disease occurs when the ASAH1 gene is not working correctly and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is diagnosed based on clinical exam, the symptoms, and enzyme and genetic testing."
"Summary of Farmer's lung disease: Farmer's lung disease is the main form of occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis (see this term), caused by chronic inhalation of microorganisms, often thermophilic actinomycetes and less commonly saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, living in mouldy hay, straw, or grain. It is characterized by variable degrees of dyspnea, cough, tiredness, headaches and occasional fever/night sweats, with acute, sub-acute or chronic clinical course"
"Summary of Fascioliasis: A parasitic infection that is caused by liver flukes, usually Fasciola hepatica, of sheep, goats, and cattle. Humans become infected by eating uncooked, infested aquatic vegetation (classically watercress). Adult flukes inhabit the bile ducts, gallbladder, and occasionally ectopic sites. Symptoms arise secondary to inflammatory response or obstruction."
"Summary of Fatal familial insomnia: Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) affects the thalamus, the part of the brain that controls the sleep-wake cycle. The most common symptoms are sleep disturbance, psychiatric problems, weight loss, and balance problems. Other symptoms include high blood pressure, excess sweating, and difficulty controlling body temperature. These symptoms tend to get worse over time. Almost all cases of FFI occur due to a specific variant in the PRNP gene and are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, sleep study, and imaging studies. The results of genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis."
Summary of Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Fetal hydantoin syndrome: Fetal hydantoin syndrome is a disorder that is caused by exposure of a fetus to phenytoin, a drug commonly prescribed for epilepsy. Not all infants exposed to phenytoin will be affected with the disorder. Symptoms in affected individuals may include abnormalities of the skull and facial features, growth deficiencies, underdeveloped nails of the fingers and toes, and/or mild developmental delays. Other findings occasionally associated with this syndrome include cleft lip and palate, having an abnormally small head (microcephaly) and brain malformations with more significant developmental delays."
Summary of Fibromatosis: Fibromatosis refers to a group of conditions characterized by overgrowths of skin and connective tissue called fibromas. These fibromas are usually benign (non-cancerous). Fibromatosis can be classified by a person's age or by the location of the fibromas. The cause of Fibromatosis is often unknown.
"Summary of Fibrous dysplasia of bone: Fibrous dysplasia is a skeletal disorder that is characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous bone tissue. It may involve one bone (monostotic) or multiple bones (polyostotic). Fibrous dysplasia can affect any bone in the body. The most common sites are the bones in the skull and face, the long bones in the arms and legs, the pelvis, and the ribs. Though many people with this disorder do not have any symptoms, others may have bone pain, abnormally shaped bones (deformities), or an increased risk of fractures (broken bones). The problems a person experiences depend on which bones are affected, and may arise from compression and displacement of adjacent structures to the lesions. For example, the legs can be of different lengths, leading to a limp, the bones of the sinuses can be affected, leading to chronic sinus congestion or headache. This condition can occur alone or as part of a genetic disorder, such as McCune-Albright syndrome."
"Summary of Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva: Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a disorder in which skeletal muscle and connective tissue, such as tendons and ligaments, are gradually replaced by bone (ossified). This condition leads to bone formation outside the skeleton (extra-skeletal or heterotopic bone) that restricts movement. This process generally becomes noticeable in early childhood, starting with the neck and shoulders and moving down the body and into the limbs. People with FOP are born with abnormal big toes (hallux valgus) which can be helpful in making the diagnosis. Trauma, such as a fall or invasive medical procedure, or a viral illness may trigger episodes of muscle swelling and inflammation (myositis). These flareups lasts for several days to months and often result in permanent bone growth in the injured area. FOP is almost always caused by a genetic change at the same place in the ACVR1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This condition occurs in about 1 in 1,600,000 newborns and about 800 people worldwide are known to have FOP."
"Summary of Severe primary trimethylaminuria: Severe primary trimethylaminuria causes the body to produce a fishy odor that is released in the sweat, urine, breath, and reproductive fluids. People with Severe primary trimethylaminuria are unable to break down trimethylamine. Trimethylamine comes from specific chemicals (choline, carnitine, TMAO) found in certain foods. The excess trimethylamine builds up and is the source of the odor. There are no other physical symptoms from Severe primary trimethylaminuria, but people with this condition may experience serious psychological and social distress. Severe primary trimethylaminuria is due to a FMO3 gene that is not working correctly. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical exam, urine analysis, and can be confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Fish-eye disease: Fish-eye disease is a rare condition that affects the eyes. People with this condition generally develop corneal clouding beginning in adolescence or early adulthood. Fish-eye disease is caused by changes in the LCAT gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In severe cases, corneal transplantation may be recommended."
"Summary of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS) is a condition in which a woman has swelling of the tissue covering the liver as a result of having pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Symptoms most often include pain in the upper right abdomen just below the ribs, fever, nausea, or vomiting. The symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease - pain in the lower abdomen and vaginal discharge - are often present as well. FHCS is usually caused by an infection of chlamydia or gonorrhea that leads to PID; it is not known why PID progresses to FHCS in some women."
Summary of Flavimonas oryzihabitans infection: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Necrotizing fasciitis: Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious infection of the skin, the tissue just beneath the skin (subcutaneous tissue), and the tissue that covers internal organs (fascia). Necrotizing fasciitis can be caused by several different types of bacteria, and the infection can arise suddenly and spread quickly. Early signs include flu-like symptoms and redness and pain around the infection site."
"Summary of Floating-Harbor syndrome: Floating-Harbor syndrome (FHS) is named after the two hospitals that reported the first cases in the 1970s: Boston Floating Hospital and Harbor General Hospital in California. Signs and symptoms of FHS include short stature, skeletal abnormalities, delayed bone age, kidney problems, minor problems with hearing and vision, characteristic facial features, speech and language problems, and mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. Behavioral difficulties that are present in many children tend to improve with age. FHS is caused by a change in the SRCAP gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant. The genetic change can be inherited from a parent or can occur for the first time in a person with the syndrome. Communication issues and developmental disabilities may be helped with early intervention programs and special education."
"Summary of Focal dermal hypoplasia: Focal dermal hypoplasia is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the skin, skeleton, eyes, and face. The skin abnormalities are present from birth and can include streaks of very thin skin (dermal hypoplasia), cutis aplasia, and telangiectases. They also may abnormalities in the nails, hands, and feet. Some of the eye findings present may include small eyes (microphthalmia), absent or severely underdeveloped eyes (anophthalmia), and problems with the tear ducts. People with Focal dermal hypoplasia may also have distinctive facial features such as a pointed chin, small ears, notched nostrils, and a slight difference in the size and shape of the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry). Most individuals with this condition are female. Males usually have milder signs and symptoms than females. Although intelligence is typically unaffected, some individuals have intellectual disability. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the PORCN gene and is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Most cases of Focal dermal hypoplasia in females result from new genetic changes in the PORCN gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. When Focal dermal hypoplasia occurs in males, it always results from a new genetic change in this gene that is not inherited."

Summary of Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Fox-Fordyce disease: It is characterized by the development of intense itching in the underarm area, the pubic area, and around the nipple of the breast as a result of perspiration which becomes trapped in the sweat gland and surrounding areas. The cause is unknown, but heat, humidity, and stress may play a role."
"Summary of Hypothalamic obesity: Hypothalamic obesity refers to obesity that is caused by physical or inborn damage to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is part of the brain that makes hormones that control specific body functions such as sleep, body temperature, and hunger. It also makes hormones that control other organs in the body, especially the pituitary gland. The symptoms of Hypothalamic obesity vary by the cause and include uncontrollable hunger, rapid, excessive weight gain, and a low metabolic rate. If the pituitary gland is involved, symptoms may include small underdeveloped testes in males and delayed puberty. This condition most often occurs because of injury to the hypothalamus due to a tumor, swelling in the brain, brain surgery, or head trauma. The diagnosis is made by physical examination and review of the symptoms."
"Summary of Fragile X syndrome: Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition involving changes in part of the X chromosome. This condition causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. It is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability in males and a significant cause of intellectual disability in females. Other signs and symptoms may include symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, seizures, and characteristic physical features. Fragile X syndrome is caused by a change in the FMR1 gene and is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner."
"Summary of Fraser syndrome: Fraser syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by fused eyelids (cryptophthalmos), fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes (syndactyly), and abnormalities of the genitalia and urinary tract. Signs and symptoms occur early in development and may also include abnormalities of the respiratory tract, specifically involving the larynx (voice box) and trachea (windpipe); failure of kidney development affecting one or both kidneys (renal agenesis); umbilical hernia; abnormalities of the nose and ear; cleft lip and palate; skeletal abnormalities; and intellectual disability. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, Fraser syndrome can be fatal before or shortly after birth. Less severely affected individuals can live into childhood or adulthood. Fraser syndrome is caused by genetic changes in three different genes: FRAS1, GRIP1, and FREM2 and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This condition is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. Genetic testing may be useful to confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome: Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS) affects the development of the bones, joints, head, and face. Symptoms of FSS are present from birth, and include abnormally flexed joints (joint contractures), spine abnormalities, and a characteristic facial appearance. People with FSS have a small mouth (microstomia) with pursed lips, giving the appearance of a ""whistling face"". In addition, they may have deep nasolabial folds (the skin between the nose and the lips) and a V-shaped chin dimple. There may be abnormalities of the eyes such as wide-spaced eyes (hypertelorism) and a narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis). People with FSS often have breathing, eating, and speech problems. The joint and spine problems may get worse over time. FSS is thought to be caused by variants in the MYH3 gene. Most cases occur by chance. Rarely, FSS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Diagnosis is based on a specific set of symptoms, clinical exam, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Frey's syndrome: Frey's syndrome is a rare, neurological disorder that causes a person to sweat excessively while eating. It most often occurs as a complication of surgery involving the parotid gland (a major salivary gland located below the ear). It may also occur following neck dissection, facelift procedures, or trauma to the area near the parotid gland. The main symptoms include flushing and excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) on the cheek, temple, or behind the ear, when eating or thinking about food (gustatory sweating). Some people with Frey's syndrome may experience a burning sensation, itching, or pain around the affected area. The symptoms are usually mild but can be severe, causing significant discomfort or social anxiety. Frey's syndrome is thought to be caused by damage to both the nerves that regulate the sweat glands, and the nerves that regulate the parotid glands. It is believed that the damaged nerves regrow abnormally and connect to the wrong glands. Frey's syndrome is diagnosed based on medical history (e.g. a history of surgery or trauma) and symptoms. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a test called the Minor's starch-iodine test."
"Summary of Friedreich ataxia: Friedreich ataxia is an inherited condition that affects the nervous system and causes movement problems. People with this condition develop impaired muscle coordination (ataxia) that worsens over time. Other features include the gradual loss of strength and sensation in the arms and legs, muscle stiffness (spasticity), and impaired speech. Many individuals have a form of heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Some develop diabetes, impaired vision, hearing loss, or an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Most people with Friedreich ataxia begin to experience the signs and symptoms around puberty. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the FXN gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Fucosidosis: Fucosidosis is a lysosomal storage disease that affects many areas of the body, especially the brain. People with this condition often have delayed development of motor skills such as walking, and the skills they do acquire often deteriorate over time. In severe cases, symptoms appear in infancy; in milder cases, symptoms begin at age 1 or 2. Fucosidosis is caused by genetic changes in the FUCA1 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have genetic changes."
"Summary of Congenital muscular dystrophy, Fukuyama type: Congenital muscular dystrophy, Fukuyama type affects the muscles and brain, causing muscle damage that gets worse over time. There are mild, typical, and severe forms of Congenital muscular dystrophy, Fukuyama type. Symptoms begin at birth and include a poor suck, weak cry, and floppiness. Later symptoms include severe speech delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and visual impairment. Over time, muscle damage can lead to heart, breathing, and swallowing problems. Congenital muscular dystrophy, Fukuyama type is caused by genetic variants in the FKTN gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, imaging studies of the brain, and confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Fumaric aciduria: Fumaric aciduria is an inherited condition that affects the brain and other parts of the nervous system. Signs and symptoms may include a small head (microcephaly), severe developmental delay, poor feeding, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), failure to thrive, seizures, and distinctive facial features. Most people with this deficiency are not able to speak or walk. A variety of brain abnormalities may be detected on MRI. Fumaric aciduria is caused by genetic changes in the FH gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive."
Summary of GM1 gangliosidosis type 1: GM1 gangliosidosis is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder that progressively destroys nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord. GM1 gangliosidosis type 1 is also known as the classic infantile form.  GM1 gangliosidosis is caused by genetic changes in the GLB1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
"Summary of Autoerythrocyte sensitization syndrome: Autoerythrocyte sensitization syndrome is a rare condition characterized by episodes of unexplained, painful bruising that mostly occurs on the arms, legs, and/or face. It is most common in Caucasian women who have mental illness or emotional stress. Symptoms typically include the formation of multiple, small, purple bruises that may be associated with burning, redness and swelling. Most affected people report that the bruising occurs either spontaneously, or some time after trauma or surgery at other sites of the body. The cause of Autoerythrocyte sensitization syndrome is poorly understood."
"Summary of Gardner syndrome: Gardner syndrome is a form of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) that is characterized by multiple colorectal polyps and various types of tumors, both benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous). They are also at an increased risk of developing other FAP-related cancers, such as those of the small bowel, stomach, pancreas, thyroid, central nervous system, liver, bile ducts, and/or adrenal gland. Other signs and symptoms of Gardner syndrome include dental abnormalities; osteomas (benign bone growths); various skin abnormalities such as epidermoid cysts, fibromas (a benign tumor of the connective tissue), and lipomas; and desmoid tumors. It is caused by changes in the APC gene and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. These may include high risk screening, prophylactic surgeries and/or certain types of medications."
Summary of Gas bloat syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of MALT lymphoma: An indolent, extranodal type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma composed of small B-lymphocytes (centrocyte-like cells). The gastrointestinal tract is the most common site of involvement. Other common sites of involvement include lung, head and neck, ocular adnexae, skin, thyroid, and breast. Gastric involvement is associated with the presence of H. pylori infection. (WHO, 2001)"
"Summary of Geographic tongue: ""Geographic tongue is a condition that causes chronic and recurrent lesions on the tongue that resemble psoriasis of the skin. It is characterized by pink to red, slightly depressed lesions with irregular, elevated, white or yellow borders. The lesions may also occur in the mucosa of the mouth and labia; this condition is called """"areata migrans"""" because these lesions typically disappear from one area and show up in another. The tongue is normally covered with tiny, pinkish-white bumps (papillae), which are actually short, fine, hair-like projections. With Geographic tongue, patches on the surface of the tongue are missing papillae and appear as smooth, red """"islands,"""" often with slightly raised borders. These patches (lesions) give the tongue a map-like, or geographic, appearance. In most cases there are no symptoms but sometimes it is painful when inflamed. The cause of this condition is unknown. Also, hereditary and environmental factors may be involved."""
"Summary of Pemphigoid gestationis: Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is a pregnancy-associated, autoimmune skin disorder. It usually begins abruptly during the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy, but it can begin at any time during pregnancy. Symptoms often include the sudden formation of very itchy, red bumps and/or blisters on the abdomen and trunk, which may then spread to other parts of the body. Unrelenting itchiness (pruritus) often interferes with daily activities. Symptoms may improve at the end of pregnancy, but flares may occur during, or right after, delivery. PG is caused by a woman's immune system producing autoantibodies and mistakenly attacking her own skin, but the trigger for autoantibody production is poorly understood."
"Summary of Gestational trophoblastic neoplasm: Gestational trophoblastic tumors (GTT) are malignant forms of gestational trophoblastic disease. The tumor always follows pregnancy, most often molar pregnancy (hydatidiform mole; see this term). Four histological subtypes have been described: invasive mole, gestational choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (see these terms)."
"Summary of Gianotti Crosti syndrome: Gianotti Crosti syndrome (GCS) is a rare childhood skin condition characterized by a papular rash with blisters on the skin of the legs, buttocks, and arms. Skin lesions typically last at least 10 days and often last for several weeks. The lesions are usually preceded by an underlying infection (usually a virus), which may cause associated symptoms such as low-grade fever, sore throat, or symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. When GCS is associated with hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr, or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, acute hepatitis may also occur. GCS is thought to be a hypersensitive response to the underlying infection. While in many countries the underlying cause is hepatitis B, this is rarely the cause in North America."
"Summary of Giant axonal neuropathy: Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormally large and dysfunctional axons (the specialized extensions of nerve cells that are required for the transmission of nerve impulses). The condition typically appears in infancy or early childhood with severe peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy (affecting movement and sensation in the arms and legs). Early signs include difficulty walking, lack of coordination, and loss of strength. Over time, the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) becomes involved, causing a gradual decline in mental function, loss of control of body movements, and seizures. Giant axonal neuropathy is caused by genetic changes in the GAN gene. It follows and autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Giant cell myocarditis: An often fatal inflammatory disorder that affects the myocardium. Morphologically, it is characterized by the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate in the myocardial tissue that includes multinucleated giant cells. It is often associated with the presence of an autoimmune disorder. Patients present with arrhythmias and/or heart failure. Heart transplantation is the only treatment option available."
"Summary of Pituitary gigantism: Pituitary gigantism is abnormally large growth due to an excess of growth hormone (GH) during childhood, before the bone growth plates have closed (epiphyseal fusion). It causes excessive growth in height, muscles, and organs, making the child extremely large for his or her age. Other symptoms may include delayed puberty; double vision or difficulty with side (peripheral) vision; prominent forehead (frontal bossing) and a prominent jaw; headache; increased sweating (hyperhidrosis); irregular periods; large hands and feet with thick fingers and toes; thickening of the facial features; and weakness. It may begin at any age before epiphyseal fusion. The most common cause is a non-cancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland, which may cause it to make too much GH, but it can be caused by other underlying conditions (which may cause a pituitary tumor) including Carney complex; McCune-Albright syndrome ; Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) and type 4; and Neurofibromatosis. In some cases the disease is caused by genetic changes in the GPR101 gene."
"Summary of Gilbert syndrome: Gilbert syndrome is a mild liver disorder that impairs the body's ability to process bilirubin, a substance made when old red blood cells are broken down. This leads to fluctuating levels of bilirubin in the blood, sometimes causing levels to be high (hyperbilirubinemia). Most people with Gilbert syndrome do not have symptoms or have mild jaundice. In some cases, jaundice is triggered or made worse by stress, exercise, fasting, dehydration, drinking alcohol, or illness. Some people with Gilbert syndrome have reported other symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, nausea, or diarrhea. There has not been evidence these other symptoms are caused by hypebilirubinemia, and the cause of these symptoms currently is unclear. People with Gilbert syndrome may also have more side effects from certain drugs such as irinotecan. Gilbert syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the UGT1A1 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. Genetic changes in this gene cause reduced levels of a liver enzyme needed to eliminate bilirubin from the body, causing bilirubin to accumulate. People with Gilbert syndrome have about one third of the normal enzyme activity, which usually is enough to prevent symptoms from developing. Of note, genetic changes in the UGT1A1 gene can alternatively cause other disorders, such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome. There are two forms: Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 (CN-1) and Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2 (CN-2). In both types, jaundice is persistent and more severe than in Gilbert syndrome, with CN-1 causing potentially severe symptoms. Sometimes it can be hard to distinguish between Gilbert syndrome and CN-2 because of considerable overlap in measured bilirubin levels. Genetic testing to identify the specific genetic change present is sometimes needed for the correct diagnosis."
"Summary of Fibromatosis, gingival, 1: Gingival fibromatosis is a rare overgrowth condition characterized by a benign, slowly progressive, nonhemorrhagic, fibrous enlargement of maxillary and mandibular keratinized gingiva (summary by Hart et al., 2002).Genetic Heterogeneity of Hereditary Gingival FibromatosisOther loci for gingival fibromatosis have been mapped to chromosome 5q (GINGF2; 605544), chromosome 2p23.3-p22.3 (GINGF3; 609955), and chromosome 11p15 (GINGF4; 611010). GINGF5 (617626) is caused by mutation in the REST gene (600571) on chromosome 4q12. There is some evidence for a locus on chromosome 2p16-p13 (see MAPPING)."
"Summary of Glial tumor: Glial tumors are a type of brain tumor that develop from the glial cells, which are specialized cells that surround and support neurons (nerve cells) in the brain. It is generally classified based on which type of glial cell is involved in the tumor. Astocytomas are tumors that develop from star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes. Ependymomas are tumors that arise from ependymal cells that line the ventricles of the brain and the center of the spinal cord. Oligodendrogliomas are tumors that affect the oligodendrocytes. The symptoms of glial tumors vary by type but may include headaches, nausea and vomiting, confusion, personality changes, trouble with balance, vision problems, speech difficulties, and/or seizures. The exact underlying cause is unknown. In most cases, glial tumors occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Gliomatosis cerebri: Gliomatosis cerebri is a type of malignant (cancerous) brain tumor called a glioblastoma that develops from a specific type of brain cell called an astrocyte. It involves at least three sections (lobes) within the main part of the brain (cerebrum). It may also affect both sides of the cerebrum as well as the nerve cells within the brain (grey matter). There are two types of Gliomatosis cerebri. Type 1 (classic form) is characterized by scattered and widespread tumor cells and no apparent mass or tumor, while type 2 has similar characteristics in addition to a detectable mass or tumor. Signs and symptoms of Gliomatosis cerebri may include personality changes, memory disturbance, headaches, and seizures."
"Summary of Glomerulonephritis: Glomerulonephritis is a type of kidney disease in which there is inflammation of the glomeruli, the tiny filters that remove excess waste and fluids from the blood. It may be acute or chronic (coming on gradually), and may occur on its own (primary) or be caused by another condition (secondary). Signs and symptoms may depend on the type and cause of the condition and may include blood in the urine; foamy urine; swelling of the face, eyes, or other body parts; abdominal pain; high blood pressure; fatigue; and/or other symptoms. If the condition is severe or prolonged, the kidneys can become damaged. It may be caused by a variety of infections and diseases, and sometimes the cause is unknown."
"Summary of Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a type of kidney disorder. It is characterized by scar tissue that forms in some of the glomeruli in the kidney. FSGS may cause non-specific signs and symptoms, including protein in the urine, elevated levels of creatinine, and swelling. In many cases the cause of FSGS can not be determined. Some cases are thought to be associated with congenital kidney defects, urine backing up into the kidneys, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, sickle cell anemia, or viruses (e.g., HIV)."
Summary of Glossodynia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Glossopharyngeal neuralgia: Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is a disorder that is associated with repeated episodes of severe pain in the tongue, throat, ear, and tonsils. These areas are all connected to the ninth cranial nerve, also called the glossopharyngeal nerve. Episodes of pain may last from a few seconds to a few minutes and usually occur on one side of the face. The pain may be triggered by swallowing, speaking, laughing, chewing, or coughing. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is thought to be caused by irritation of the glossopharyngeal nerve, but the exact cause of the irritation is sometimes unknown. Laboratory and imaging tests can be used to diagnose the disorder and rule out serious underlying problems."
"Summary of Class I glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a hereditary condition in which red blood cells break down (hemolysis) when the body is exposed to certain foods, drugs, infections or stress. It occurs when a person is missing or has low levels of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This enzyme helps red blood cells work properly. Symptoms during a hemolytic episode may include dark urine, fatigue, paleness, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and yellowing of the skin (jaundice). G6PD deficiency is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner and symptoms are more common in males (particularly African Americans and those from certain parts of Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean). It is caused by genetic changes in the G6PD gene."
"Summary of Glucose-galactose malabsorption: Glucose-galactose malabsorption (GGM) is a genetic condition in which the sugars glucose and galactose cannot be properly absorbed by the body. Infants with GGM develop severe diarrhea resulting in severe dehydration, acidosis, and weight loss in the first few weeks of life. GGM is caused by genetic changes in the SLC5A1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This gene normally makes a special protein which helps the two sugars cross through the cell membranes of the epithelial cells lining the small intestine and special tubes in the kidneys. When the protein is missing, the cells cannot take in the glucose and galactose needed by the body. The diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic metabolic disorder. People with Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency don't make enough of one of the enzymes needed to break down certain amino acids found in the proteins we eat. Without enough of the enzyme, the breakdown products of these amino acids build up in tissues of the body. The buildup of these chemicals can damage the brain, especially the area of the brain called the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia helps control the body's movements. Other early symptoms may include weak muscles and early signs of developmental delay. An infection or fever may trigger an episode that causes serious damage to the basal ganglia. In some children, the brain damage will happen without a triggering fever. Damage to the basal ganglia will make it hard for the child to control the movements of their body. Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the GCDH gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is included on the newborn screening panel in most countries."
"Summary of Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a disorder that interferes with the body's ability to break down proteins and fats to produce energy. The severity of Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency varies widely. Babies most severely affected may be born with physical abnormalities including brain malformations, an enlarged liver, kidney malformations, unusual facial features, and genital abnormalities. They may also emit an odor resembling sweaty feet. Others have a less severe form which may appear in infancy, childhood, or even adulthood. Most often, Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency first appears in infancy or early childhood as a sudden episode of a metabolic crisis that can cause weakness, behavior changes (such as poor feeding and decreased activity) and vomiting. Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by genetic changes in the ETFA, ETFB, or ETFDH genes."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency: Glycogen storage disease due to muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency is a genetic disorder that prevents the body from breaking down glycogen. Glycogen is an important source of energy that is stored in muscle tissue. People with Glycogen storage disease due to muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency typically experience fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during the first few minutes of exercise (exercise intolerance). Usually, when people with this disease rest after brief exercise they can resume exercising with little or no discomfort (a characteristic phenomenon known as ""second wind""). The signs and symptoms can vary significantly and may include burgundy-colored urine, fatigue, exercise intolerance, muscle cramps, muscle pain, muscle stiffness, and muscle weakness. It is caused by genetic changes in the PYGM gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to liver glycogen phosphorylase deficiency: Glycogen storage disease due to liver glycogen phosphorylase deficiency is a genetic disease in which the liver cannot process sugar properly. The liver is responsible for breaking down a substance called glycogen. Glycogen is the stored form of sugar that is made by breaking down carbohydrates. When the liver cannot break down glycogen properly it causes a buildup that is damaging to the body. Symptoms of the disease usually begin in infancy or childhood and include low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and an increase in the amount of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis). These symptoms are especially likely to occur when an individual does not eat for a long time. Symptoms tend to improve as people with this disease get older. The disease is especially common in the Mennonite population. Glycogen storage disease due to liver glycogen phosphorylase deficiency is caused by genetic changes (changes) in the PYGL gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The diagnosis is made based on genetic testing of the PYGL gene. A liver biopsy that tests the function of liver glycogen phosphorylase may be necessary if the results of the genetic testing are inconclusive."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease 8: An x-linked recessive hepatic glycogen storage disease resulting from lack of expression of phosphorylase-b-kinase activity. Symptoms are relatively mild; hepatomegaly, increased liver glycogen, and decreased leukocyte phosphorylase are present. Liver shrinkage occurs in response to glucagon."
"Summary of Goldenhar disease: Goldenhar disease is a condition that is present at birth and mainly affects the development of the eye, ear, and spine. The main sign and symptoms are facial asymmetry (one side of the face is different from the other), a partially formed ear (microtia) or totally absent ear (anotia), noncancerous (benign) growths of the eye (ocular dermoid cysts), and spinal abnormalities. Goldenhar disease may also affect the heart, lungs, kidneys, and central nervous system. It is due to problems that occur when the fetus is forming within the womb of the mother, in structures known as the first and second brachial arch. These structures will develop to form the neck and the head. The cause is still unknown. Goldenhar syndrome is part of a group of conditions known as craniofacial microsomia. It is not known whether the conditions included in the group really are different conditions or part of the same problem with different degrees of severity."
"Summary of Gorham-Stout disease: Gorham-Stout disease is a rare bone disorder characterized by bone loss (osteolysis), often associated abnormal blood vessel growth (angiomatous proliferation). Bone loss can occur in just one bone, or spread to soft tissue and adjacent bones. Symtoms may include pain, swelling, and increased risk of fracture. It may affect any part of the skeleton, but most commonly involves the skull, collarbone (clavicle), pelvis, ribs, spine, and/or jaw. Depending on the bones affected, various complications may occur. The cause of Gorham-Stout disease is currently unknown. Most cases occur sporadically."
"Summary of Acrogeria: Acrogeria, Gottron type is a premature aging syndrome which includes fragile, thin skin on the hands, feet and face and slow growth. Other symptoms include visible blood vessels, easy bruising, and hair and nail abnormalities. In general, the symptoms do not appear to get worse over time. Intelligence is normal. The cause is unknown, although several genes have been associated with it. Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported. Diagnosis is based on a clinical exam and the symptoms."
"Summary of Acute graft versus host disease: A syndrome of immunologically mediated tissue damage that may occur following an allogeneic transplant, usually affecting the skin, liver, and GI tract. The onset is usually within one hundred days of transplantation or immunologic manipulation."
Summary of Granulocytopenia: A decrease in the number of GRANULOCYTES; (BASOPHILS; EOSINOPHILS; and NEUTROPHILS).
"Summary of Granuloma annulare: Granuloma annulare (GA) is skin disorder that most often causes a rash with red bumps (erythematous papules) arranged in a circle or ring pattern (annular). GA is not contagious and is not cancerous. The rash may be localized or generalized. Localized GA is the most common form of GA (75% of the cases) and usually affects the forearms, hands, or feet. The generalized form of GA (15% of cases) presents with numerous erythematous papules that form larger, slightly raised patches (plaques) anywhere on the body, including the palms of hands and soles of feet. The plaques may or may not be in the ring pattern and can vary in color. Less common forms of GA include subcutaneous, perforating, and patch variants. The underlying cause of GA is unknown, but there are several factors that may trigger the disorder, including injury to the skin, viral infections, and certain medications and medical diseases. However, most cases of GA develop in healthy people. Diagnosis of GA is made by the appearance of skin lesions and lack of other physical findings or symptoms. GA may be confirmed by a biopsy and tests may be performed to rule out other associated diseases."
Summary of Granulomatous hypophysitis: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Granulomatous rosacea: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Graves disease: Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that leads to overactivity of the thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). It is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the thyroid gland, causing the gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and occurs most often in women over age 20. However, the disorder may occur at any age and can affect males as well. More common signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease include irritability, a fast and irregular heartbeat, hand tremors, diarrhea, increased sweating, trouble sleeping, and weight loss. Some people develop abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). Women with Graves' disease may have irregular menstrual periods. In some cases, Graves' disease causes other problems such as Graves' dermopathy (a condition marked by red, swollen skin), various eye abnormalities (such as bulging eyes, vision problems, pain, or swelling), emotional or behavioral changes, heart-related complications, or bone problems (such as osteoporosis)."
"Summary of Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome: Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) is a congenital disorder that affects development of the limbs, head, and face. Findings might include an extra finger or toe (polydactyly), fusion of the skin between the fingers or toes (syndactyly), widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), and an abnormally large head size (macrocephaly).The features of this syndrome are highly variable, ranging from polydactyly and syndactyly of the upper and/or lower limbs to seizure, hydrocephalus , and intellectual disability. Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the GLI3 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
Summary of Grover's disease: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Growth hormone deficiency: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Guillain-Barré syndrome: Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) is a rare syndrome in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system carries signals from the brain to the muscles. Symptoms of GBS include muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling sensations, which can increase in intensity until the muscles cannot be used at all (paralysis). The exact cause of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome is unknown. In most cases, GBS occurs a few days or weeks after symptoms of a viral infection. In rare cases, GBS may run in families. A diagnosis of GBS is suspected when a person has symptoms suggestive of the syndrome. A variety of tests, including a spinal tap, may be completed to confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Gyrate atrophy of choroid and retina: Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina is an inherited disorder of protein metabolism characterized by progressive vision loss. Symptoms such as nearsightedness (myopia), difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness), and loss of side (peripheral) vision develop during childhood. Over time, the field of vision progressively narrows, resulting in tunnel vision. Cataracts may also develop. While most people with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina have no symptoms other than vision loss, neonatal hyperammonemia (excess ammonia in the blood in the newborn period), neurological abnormalities, intellectual disability, peripheral nerve problems, and muscle weakness may occur. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the OAT gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Hemangioendothelioma: ""The term Hemangioendothelioma describes several types of vascular neosplasms and includes both non-cancerous (benign) and cancerous (malignant) growths. The term has also been applied to those that show """"borderline"""" behavior, intermediate between entirely benign hemangiomas and highly malignant angiosarcomas. Hemangioendotheliomas are caused by abnormal growth of blood vessel cells, although the exact underlying cause for the abnormal growth is unknown. They can also develop in an organ, such as the liver or lung. They usually grow slowly and can sometimes spread to other tissues in the body (metastasize). Examples of types of Hemangioendotheliomas include spindle cell hemangioma; papillary intralymphatic (Dabska tumor); retiform; kaposiform; epithelioid; pseudomyogenic (epithelioid sarcoma-like Hemangioendothelioma); and composite."""
"Summary of Congenital factor XII deficiency: Congenital factor XII deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects a protein (factor XII) involved in blood clotting. While a lack of factor XII does not cause affected individuals to bleed abnormally, the blood takes longer than normal to clot in a test tube. The condition is usually discovered when prolonged clotting is noticed in the process of running other laboratory tests. Congenital factor XII deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the F12 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Familial benign chronic pemphigus: Familial benign chronic pemphigus is a genetic skin disease that causes blistering. Signs and symptoms include a painful rash and blistering in skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, neck, under the breasts, and between the buttocks. Secondary bacterial infections are not uncommon. Symptoms are often worse in summer months due to heat, sweating, and friction. Familial benign chronic pemphigus is caused by genetic changes in the ATP2C1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Classic hairy cell leukemia: Hairy cell leukemia is a rare, slow-growing cancer of the blood in which the bone marrow makes too many B cells (lymphocytes), a type of white blood cell that fights infection. The condition is named after these excess B cells which look 'hairy' under a microscope. As the number of leukemia cells increases, fewer healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets are produced. The symptoms include a large spleen (splenomegalia) but without an increase of lymph nodes, and general symptoms such as fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss. Blood exams show the decreased number of blood cells and platelets. The diagnosis can be made with the biopsy of the bone marrow, blood exams showing antigens that are released by the B-cells. The leukemia cells show an specific change (variation) in a gene involved in cell growth, the BRAF gene, that increases the growth and spread of cancer cells. The cause is still unknown."
Summary of Black hairy tongue: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration: Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a rare disease characterized by a progressive degeneration of the nervous system (neurodegenerative disorder) and buildup of iron in the brain. PKAN is usually classified into two forms: classic and atypical. All individuals with PKAN have an abnormal buildup of iron in certain areas of the brain. A particular change, called the eye-of-the-tiger sign, which indicates a buildup of iron, is typically seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain in people with this disorder. PKAN is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by genetic changes in the PANK2 gene."
Summary of Harlequin ichthyosis: Harlequin ichthyosis is a severe genetic disorder that mainly affects the skin. The newborn infant is covered with plates of thick skin that crack and split apart. The thick plates can pull at and distort facial features and can restrict breathing and eating. Genetic changes in the ABCA12 gene cause Harlequin ichthyosis. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
"Summary of Hartnup disease: Hartnup disease is a metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal transport of certain amino acids in the kidney and gastrointestinal system. It is a type of aminoaciduria. The condition may be diagnosed based on the results of newborn screening tests. Most people with the condition have no symptoms (asymptomatic). Mental development is usually normal, though a few cases with intellectual impairment have been reported. The signs and symptoms of Hartnup disease incude skin photosensitivity, neurologic findings, psychiatric symptoms, and ocular (eye) findings. Hartnup disease is caused by genetic changes in the SLC6A19 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Hashimoto's syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome: Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome (AEC syndrome) is a form of ectodermal dysplasia, a group of conditions characterized by abnormal development of ectodermal tissues including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. The most common feature is missing patches of skin (erosions) on the scalp, neck, hands, and feet. The skin erosions can lead to infection, scarring, and hair loss. Other features include changes in skin coloring; misshapen or absent fingernails and toenails; malformed or missing teeth; increased sensitivity to heat; hearing loss; cleft lip and/or palate; and other facial abnormalities. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the TP63 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome was classified as a separate disorder until it was discovered that it result from genetic changes in the same part of the TP63 gene. Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome and AEC syndrome are considered to be part of the same disease spectrum."
"Summary of Heavy metal poisoning: Heavy metal poisoning refers to when excessive exposure to a heavy metal affects the normal function of the body. Examples of heavy metals that can cause toxicity include lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. Exposure may occur through the diet, from medications, from the environment, or in the course of work or play. Heavy metals can enter the body through the skin, or by inhalation or ingestion. Toxicity can result from sudden, severe exposure, or from chronic exposure over time. For example, young children are more susceptible to the effects of lead exposure because they absorb more compared with adults and their brains are still developing. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common symptoms of acute metal ingestion. Chronic exposure may cause various symptoms resulting from damage to body organs, and may increase the risk of cancer."
"Summary of Helminthiasis: A parasitic infection characterized by the infestation with worms, mainly in the intestine."
"Summary of Hemifacial microsomia: Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is a condition in which part of one side of the face is underdeveloped and does not grow normally. The eye, cheekbone, lower jaw, facial nerves, muscles, and neck may be affected. Other findings may include hearing loss from underdevelopment of the middle ear; a small tongue; and macrostomia (large mouth). HFM is the second most common facial birth defect after clefts. The cause of HFM in most cases is unknown. It usually occurs in people with no family history of HFM, but it is inherited in some cases. HFM is part of a group of conditions known as ""craniofacial microsomia"". It is not known whether the conditions included in the group really are different conditions or part of the same problem with different degrees of severity."
"Summary of Sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease syndrome: Sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease syndrome is a type of sickle cell disease, which means it affects the shape of the red blood cells. Red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying blood throughout the body. People with Sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease syndrome have red blood cells that are differently shaped and therefore do not carry oxygen as effectively. Symptoms of Sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease syndrome include anemia and episodes of fatigue and extreme pain (vaso-occlusive crisis). The severity of the symptoms can vary from person to person. Sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the gene that tells our bodies how to make hemoglobin. These genetic changes cause changes in the shape of the red blood cells. People affected by Sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease syndrome need to be especially careful to avoid infection and should be checked regularly by doctors to make sure all of the organs in the body are functioning properly. In times when the anemia becomes severe, a person affected by Sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease syndrome may require a blood transfusion. A bone marrow transplant may also be recommended depending on the severity of the symptoms."
"Summary of Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a condition in which the body makes too many activated immune cells (macrophages and lymphocytes). Symptoms may include fever, enlarged liver or spleen, cytopenia (decreased number of blood cells), and neurological abnormalities. HLH may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner or it can have non-genetic causes in which case it is called acquired HLH. Each subtype is caused by a change in a different gene. The genetic cause of type 1 is currently unknown. Types 2-5 are caused by genetic changes in the PRF1 gene, the UNC13D gene, the STX11 gene and the STXBP2 gene, respectively. When HLH results from an inappropriate immune response to Epstein-Barr virus or another viral illness, it may be due to a separate genetic condition called X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP). XLP is caused by a genetic change in the SH2D1A or XIAP gene and is inherited in an X-linked manner."
Summary of Hemophagocytic reticulosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Hemophilia A: Hemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot normally. People with Hemophilia A will bleed more than normal after an injury, surgery, or dental procedure. This disorder can be severe, moderate, or mild. In severe cases, heavy bleeding occurs after minor injury or even when there is no injury (spontaneous bleeding). Bleeding into the joints, muscles, brain, or organs can cause pain and other serious complications. In milder forms, there is no spontaneous bleeding, and the disorder might only be diagnosed after a surgery or serious injury. Hemophilia A is caused by having low levels of a protein called factor VIII. Factor VIII is needed to form blood clots. The disorder is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner and is caused by changes in the F8 gene. The diagnosis of Hemophilia A is made through clinical symptoms and specific laboratory tests to measure the amount of clotting factors in the blood. Hemophilia A mainly affects males."
"Summary of Hemophilic arthropathy: A form of arthritis that affects hemophiliacs, which is characterized by bleeding into the joint space."
"Summary of Essential thrombocythemia: Essential thrombocythemia belongs to a group of diseases called myeloproliferative neoplasms, which cause the bone marrow to make too many platelets, white blood cells and/or red blood cells. In Essential thrombocythemia, the body produces too many platelets. The signs and symptoms vary from person to person, but most people with Essential thrombocythemia do not have any symptoms when the platelet cell count first increases. Signs and symptoms that develop as the disease progresses include: increased production of megakaryocytes (a type of cell in the bone marrow that is responsible for making platelets);   enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly); and   bleeding in several parts of the body and/or clotting episodes such as strokes, pain in the legs and difficulty breathing. Other symptoms may include weakness, headaches, or a burning, tingling or prickling sensation in the skin. Some people have episodes of severe pain, redness, and swelling (especially in the hands and feet). Essential thrombocythemia may be caused by a person acquiring (not inheriting) a somatic genetic change in any of several genes, such as the JAK2 gene (most frequently), CALR gene, and rarely, the MPL, THPO, or TET2 gene. The reason why some people acquire genetic changes that cause the disease is unknown."
Summary of Hemosiderosis: Accumulation of iron in internal organs.
"Summary of Adult hepatocellular carcinoma: A rare carcinoma of the liver characterized by one to several or many nodules occurring anywhere within the liver, composed of neoplastic epithelial cells with hepatocellular differentiation. The vast majority of tumors are associated with chronic liver disease (such as hepatitis B or C, or steatohepatitis) or exposure to a variety of exogenous agents. Patients may present with signs and symptoms related to the tumor, as well as to the underlying condition. Common manifestations include right upper quadrant abdominal pain, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and ascites. Symptomatic tumors generally have poor prognosis."
"Summary of Hepatorenal syndrome: Hepatorenal syndrome is a form of impaired kidney function that occurs in individuals with advanced chronic liver disease. As many as 40% of individuals with cirrhosis and ascites will develop Hepatorenal syndrome. Symptoms may include fatigue, abdominal pain, and a general feeling of ill health (malaise). There are two distinct types of Hepatorenal syndrome. Type I progresses quickly (within days), leading to kidney failure. Individuals with type I typically have dramatically reduced urine output, edema, and jaundice, and often suffer from hepatic encephalopathy. Type II progresses more slowly, over weeks or months, and the symptoms are less severe. The cause of Hepatorenal syndrome is unknown. A contributing factor seems to be a narrowing of the blood vessels that connect into the kidneys. This causes a decrease in blood flow to the kidneys, impairing their function. In some cases, triggers or precipitating factors (infections, blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, low blood pressure) are involved."
"Summary of Hereditary amyloidosis: Hereditary amyloidosis refers to a group of inherited conditions that make up one of the subtypes of amyloidosis. Hereditary amyloidosis is characterized by the deposit of an abnormal protein called amyloid in multiple organs of the body where it should not be, which causes disruption of organ tissue structure and function. In Hereditary amyloidosis, amyloid deposits most often occur in tissues of the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. While symptoms of Hereditary amyloidosis may appear in childhood, most individuals do not experience symptoms until adulthood. There are many types of Hereditary amyloidosis associated with different genetic changes and abnormal proteins. The most common type of Hereditary amyloidosis is transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), a condition in which the amyloid deposits are most often made up of the transthyretin protein which is made in the liver. Other examples of Hereditary amyloidosis include, but are not limited to, apolipoprotein AI amyloidosis (A ApoAI), gelsolin amyloidosis (A Gel), lysozyme amyloidosis (A Lys), cystatin C amyloidosis (A Cys), fibrinogen AÎ±-chain amyloidosis (A Fib), and apolipoprotein AII amyloidosis (A ApoAII). Most types of Hereditary amyloidosis are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
Summary of Hereditary ataxia: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Myopathic carnitine deficiency: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of CLN9 disease: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 9 (CLN9-NCL) is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Symptoms may include loss of muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures that do not respond to medications, muscle twitches (myoclonus), visual impairment, and developmental regression (the loss of previously acquired skills). The underlying genetic cause of CLN9-NCL is unknown but it appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Hereditary coproporphyria: Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is a rare inherited form of liver (hepatic) porphyria, characterized by neurological symptoms in the form of episodes (acute attacks) of stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, weakness, numbness, and pain in the hands and feet (neuropathy). The porphyrias are a group of blood conditions caused by a lack of an enzyme in the body that makes heme, an important molecule that carries oxygen throughout the body and is vital for all of the body's organs. Symptoms present during the attacks may include body pain, nausea and vomiting, increased heart rate (tachycardia), and high blood pressure. Less common symptoms include seizures, skin lesions, and paralysis of the arms and legs, body trunk, and respiratory muscles. Most individuals with HCP do not have any signs or symptoms between attacks. HCP is caused by genetic changes in the CPOX gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and specific blood, urine and stool testing."
"Summary of Hereditary elliptocytosis: Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) refers to a group of inherited blood conditions where the red blood cells are abnormally shaped. Symptoms vary from very mild to severe and can include fatigue, shortness of breath, gallstones, and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). Some people with this condition have an enlarged spleen. Hereditary elliptocytosis is caused by a genetic change in either the EPB41, SPTA1, or SPTB gene, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis is a related condition with more serious symptoms, and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis of this condition is made by looking at the shape of the red blood cells under a microscope."
"Summary of Hereditary fructose intolerance: Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a metabolic disease caused by the absence of an enzyme called aldolase B. In people with HFI, ingestion of fructose (fruit sugar) and sucrose (cane or beet sugar, table sugar) causes severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and the build up of dangerous substances in the liver. HFI may be relatively mild or a very severe disease. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the ALDOB gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited disorder of the blood vessels that can cause excessive bleeding. People with HHT can develop abnormal blood vessels called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in several areas of the body. AVMs on the skin are called telangiectasias. AVMs can also develop in other parts of the body, including the brain, lungs, liver, or intestines. HHT is caused by a genetic change in one of several genes, including ACVRL1, ENG, SMAD4, and GDF2. Changes in at least other two unknown genes are also suspected of causing HHT in some people. HHT is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means a person only needs to inherit one copy of the changed gene to have HHT."
"Summary of Hereditary chronic pancreatitis: Hereditary pancreatitis causes multiple episodes of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), an important digestive organ. Symptoms usually begin in childhood and may last a few days or longer. Signs and symptoms may include stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting. People with Hereditary pancreatitis develop chronic pancreatitis, a constantly inflamed pancreas. This leads to symptoms which may include fatty stools, weight loss, and poor absorption of nutrients from food. Adults with Hereditary pancreatitis are at an increased risk for type 1 diabetes and pancreatic cancer. In most cases, Hereditary pancreatitis is due to a PRSS1 gene that is not working correctly and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, a clinical history and exam, and the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1: Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSN1) is a neurological condition characterized by nerve abnormalities in the legs and feet. Many people with this condition have tingling, weakness, and a reduced ability to feel pain and sense hot and cold. Some affected people do not lose sensation, but instead feel shooting pains in their legs and feet. As HSN1 progresses, sensory problems can affect the hands, arms, shoulders, and abdomen. In rare cases, people with this condition develop sensorineural hearing loss. HSN1 is caused by genetic changes in any of several genes, depending on the form of HSN1 (HSN1A is caused by genetic changes in the SPTLC1 gene; HSN1B is linked to a gene located in chromosome 3; HSN1C is caused by genetic changes in the SPTLC2 gene; HSN1D is caused by genetic changes in the ATL1 gene and HSN1E is caused by genetic changes in DNMT1 gene. All forms of HSN1 are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Hereditary spastic paraplegia: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of hereditary, degenerative, neurological disorders that primarily affect the upper motor neurons. Upper motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord deliver signals to the lower motor neurons, which in turn, carry messages to the muscles. In Hereditary spastic paraplegia, upper motor neurons slowly degenerate so the muscles do not receive the correct messages, causing progressive spasticity (increased muscle tone/stiffness) and weakness of the legs. This leads to difficulty walking. If only the lower body is affected, HSP is classified as uncomplicated or pure. HSP is classified as complicated or complex if other systems are involved. In these cases, additional symptoms, including impaired vision, ataxia, epilepsy, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and/or deafness, occur. The different forms of HSP are caused by genetic changes in different genes. Inheritance varies."
"Summary of Hereditary spherocytosis: Hereditary spherocytosis is a condition characterized by hemolytic anemia (when red blood cells are destroyed earlier than normal). Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include pale skin, fatigue, anemia, jaundice, gallstones, and/or enlargement of the spleen. Other symptoms of hemolytic anemia may include feeling that your heart is pounding or racing (palpitations), feeling dizzy, problems concentrating, and headaches. Some people with a severe form of Hereditary spherocytosis may have short stature, delayed puberty, and skeletal abnormalities. The condition is caused by genetic changes in any of several genes, such as the ANK1, EPB42, SLC4A1, SPTA1, and SPTB genes. It is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There are different types of Hereditary spherocytosis, which are distinguished by severity and genetic cause."
"Summary of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) affects multiple body systems and includes bleeding and visual problems, and abnormally light coloring of the skin, hair, and eyes (oculocutaneous albinism). Other symptoms may include immune problems, lung scarring (pulmonary fibrosis), and colitis. Symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis may get worse over time, and people with HPS are at increased risk for skin cancer. There are ten types of HPS each caused by a different non-working gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. HPS is diagnosed based on the symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Herpes simplex virus encephalitis: Herpes simplex encephalitis is a rare neurological condition that is characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). People affected by this condition may experience a headache and fever for up to 5 days, followed by personality and behavioral changes; seizures; hallucinations; and altered levels of consciousness. Herpes simplex encephalitis is caused by a virus called the herpes simplex virus. Most cases are associated with herpes simplex virus type I (the cause of cold sores or fever blisters), although rare cases can be caused by herpes simplex virus type II (genital herpes). It is poorly understood why some people who are infected with herpes simplex virus develop Herpes simplex encephalitis while others do not. Changes in genes such as TLR3 and TRAF3 have been observed suggesting there may be a genetic component in some cases."
Summary of Herpesvirus simiae B virus infection: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Chronic hiccup: Chronic hiccups are repeated, unintentional contractions of the breathing muscles that continue for a long period of time. Regular hiccups often develop after eating a large meal or drinking a carbonated beverage, and they typically go away on their own after a couple minutes. Chronic hiccups last over two days and in rare cases, may continue for over a month. Complications of Chronic hiccups can include insomnia, fatigue, weight loss, malnutrition, and depression or anxiety. The exact underlying cause is often unknown; and over 100 different causes of Chronic hiccups have been reported. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and the duration of the hiccups."
"Summary of Hidradenitis suppurativa: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin disease which causes painful, boil-like lumps that form under the skin and often secrete pus and blood. HS occurs most often in areas where skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. Symptoms usually begin after puberty. The first sign may be a single pocket of pus (abscess) or hard lumps associated with hair follicles. The abscesses or lumps often change to painful swollen clusters of skin sores that drain a bloody and often, bad smelling discharge. As the sores heal, they may leave hardened, rope-like scars or form tunnels under the skin (called sinus tracks) that can be disfiguring and make movement difficult. As time goes by, the skin lesions occur more often and get worse over time. In most cases, the cause of HS is unknown. Genetics, environment, and hormonal factors may play a role. Some cases of HS have been associated with specific genes, including NCSTN, PSEN1, and PSENEN. Diagnosis of HS is made based on the clinical symptoms."
"Summary of Hirschsprung disease: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a disease of the large intestine or colon. People with this disease do not have the nerve cells in the intestine required to pass stools from the body normally. Symptoms of Hirschsprung disease usually start in very young children, but may occur later. The symptoms may vary with age, but often involve constipation and/or obstruction of the bowel. Other signs and symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain or swelling, diarrhea, poor feeding, malnutrition, and slow growth. There are two main types of Hirschsprung disease, known as short-segment disease and long-segment disease, defined by the region of the intestine lacking nerve cells (aganglionic segments). HSCR is considered a neurocristopathy, a disorder of cells and tissues derived from the neural crest, (a group of embryonic cells of the neural tube that forms several structures, of the body). HSCR may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a another disorder. Isolated HSCR is associated with genetic changes in several genes."
"Summary of Histidinemia: Histidinemia is an inherited metabolic condition characterized by elevated levels of the amino acid histidine in blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. In most cases, people with this condition have no health problems and may not even know that they are affected. Individuals with Histidinemia who also experience a medical complication during or shortly after birth (such as a temporary lack of oxygen), may be at an increased risk of developing intellectual disability, behavioral problems, or learning disabilities. Histidinemia is caused by changes in the HAL gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called histidase, which breaks down histidine into a molecule called urocanic acid. If histidase doesn't do its job properly, histidine levels become elevated. Histidinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Holoprosencephaly: Holoprosencephaly is an abnormality of brain development in which the brain doesn't properly divide into the right and left hemispheres. The condition can also affect development of the head and face. There are 4 types of Holoprosencephaly, distinguished by severity. From most to least severe, the 4 types are alobar, semi-lobar, lobar, and middle interhemispheric variant (MIHV). In general, the severity of any facial defects corresponds to the severity of the brain defect. The most severely affected people have one central eye (cyclopia) and a tubular nasal structure (proboscis) located above the eye. In the less severe forms, the brain is only partially divided, and the eyes usually are set close together. Other signs and symptoms often include intellectual disability and pituitary gland problems. Holoprosencephaly can be caused by genetic changes in any of at least 14 different genes; chromosome abnormalities; or agents that can cause birth defects (teratogens). It may also be a feature of several unique genetic syndromes. In many cases, the exact cause is unknown."
"Summary of Holt-Oram syndrome: Holt-Oram syndrome affects the bones of the hands and arms and may also affect the heart. People with Holt-Oram syndrome have at least one bone in the wrist that did not form (develop) normally. Other bones in the hands, arms, and shoulder may also have developed abnormally. Many of these developmental changes in the bones can only be seen on an x-ray. Most people with Holt-Oram syndrome also have heart problems, including problems due to the way the heart formed (congenital) or problems with the way the heart beats. Holt-Oram syndrome is caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variantss) in the TBX5 gene. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A diagnosis of Holt-Oram syndrome may be suspected when a person has symptoms of the syndrome. An x-ray of the hands, wrists, and arms, echocardiogram of the heart, and genetic testing may be used to confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Classic homocystinuria: Classic homocystinuria is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to correctly use the amino acid, homocysteine, one of the building blocks of protein. This form of homocystinuria is caused by a genetic change in the CBS gene, which leads to low levels or absence of an enzyme called cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). When CBS is absent or not working right, homocysteine and other toxic chemicals build up in the blood and urine. Symptoms of this disorder include poor growth and slow weight gain in infancy. Additional symptoms include nearsightedness, dislocation of the lens of the eye, an increased risk of blood clots, and developmental problems. Classic homocystinuria is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
Summary of Homologous wasting disease: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Congenital Horner syndrome: Congenital Horner syndrome, also known as Horner's syndrome, is a rare condition characterized by miosis (constriction of the pupil), ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), and anhidrosis (absence of sweating of the face). It is caused by damage to the sympathetic nerves of the face. In rare cases, congenital Horner syndrome may be associated with a lack of pigmentation of the iris (colored part of the eye)."
"Summary of Mucopolysaccharidosis type 2: Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II) is an inherited disorder of carbohydrate metabolism that occurs almost exclusively in males. It is characterized by distinctive facial features, a large head, hydrocephalus, enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), umbilical or inguinal hernia, and hearing loss. Individuals with this condition may additionally have joint deformities and heart abnormalities involving the valves. MPS II is caused by genetic changes in the IDS gene and is inherited in an X-linked manner. There is a wide range in severity of symptoms present in individuals with MPS II. Previously, MPS II was classified as severe and attenuated based on severity. More recently, the terms slowly progressive and early progressive have been suggested. Individuals with the less severe type typically live into adulthood and intelligence is not affected."
"Summary of Huntington disease: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited condition that causes progressive degeneration of neurons in the brain. It is caused by changes in the HTT gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. There is also a less common, early-onset form of HD which begins in childhood or adolescence."
"Summary of Hydranencephaly: Hydranencephaly is a rare condition in which the brain's cerebral hemispheres are absent and replaced by sacs filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Affected infants may appear and act normal at birth, but irritability and hypertonia often develop within a few weeks. Other signs and symptoms may include seizures, hydrocephalus, visual impairment, lack of growth, deafness, blindness, paralysis, and intellectual disabilities."
"Summary of Congenital hydrocephalus: Congenital hydrocephalus is when a child is born with an excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain. CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This excess fluid causes an abnormal widening of spaces in the brain called ventricles (ventriculomegalia) and can create a harmful pressure on brain tissue. Symptoms of hydrocephalus vary and may include an unusually large head with thin, transparent scalp, bulging forehead with increased spaces between the bones of the skull (fontanelles), and a downward gaze. Other symptoms may include seizures, abnormal reflexes, slow heartbeat and respiratory rate, headaches, vomiting, irritability, weakness, and visual problems. It is caused by genetic and non-genetic factors. The most common cause of Congenital hydrocephalus are variations in the L1CAM gene, where there is a narrow passageway between the third and fourth ventricles (aqueductal stenosis). Other causes include genetic changes in many other genes, brain and/or spinal cord malformations, infections, bleeding inside the cavities of the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage), trauma, exposition to certain drugs (teratogens) or a congenital tumor of the brain. Congenital hydrocephalus can be an isolated malformation or be part of a syndrome where there are other associated malformations. Hydrocephalus may be subdivided according to the particular defect that exists in the brain and whether the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is high or normal: Communicating hydrocephalus is when there is no blockage (obstruction) in the ventricules but the fluid is not absorbed readily, or there is too much fluid to be absorbed. Noncommunicating (obstructive) hydrocephalus is when there is a blockage of the CSF causing widening (dilation) of the pathways that are located upstream of the block, resulting in an increased pressure inside the brain. There are also 2 other forms of hydrocephalus that usually affect only adults: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is where the ventricules are expanded but the pressure inside the nervous system is normal. Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo occurs when stroke or traumatic injury cause damage to the brain and the brain tissue may shrink. Hydrocephalus may also be classified in congenital or acquired. Acquired hydrocephalus develops at the time of birth or at some point afterward and may be caused by injury or disease."
"Summary of Hydrolethalus: Hydrolethalus (HLS) is a severe fetal malformation syndrome characterized by craniofacial dysmorphic features, central nervous system, cardiac, respiratory tract and limb abnormalities."
"Summary of Hypercementosis: A regressive change of teeth characterized by excessive development of secondary cementum on the tooth surface. It may occur on any part of the root, but the apical two-thirds are most commonly affected. (Dorland, 27th ed)"
"Summary of Dysbetalipoproteinemia: Dysbetalipoproteinemia is an inherited condition that disrupts the normal breakdown of fats (lipids) in the body, causing a large amount of certain fatty materials to build up in the body. Some individuals never have symptoms of this condition. Symptoms usually do not appear unless a second genetic or environmental factor adds to increased lipid levels. Symptoms may include: yellowish lipid-filled bumps on the skin (xanthomas), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), and a buildup of fat in the blood vessels (atherosclerosis). Dysbetalipoproteinemia may lead to the development of cardiovascular disease. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the APOE gene. The inheritance of this condition is considered to be complicated, as having genetic changes in the APOE gene often does not lead to the development of symptoms without the influence of other factors. Most people with symptoms of Dysbetalipoproteinemia have two genetic changes in the APOE gene, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Familial apolipoprotein A5 deficiency: A severe type of hyperlipidemia, sometimes familial, that is characterized by the elevation of both plasma CHYLOMICRONS and TRIGLYCERIDES contained in VERY-LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS. Type V hyperlipoproteinemia is often associated with DIABETES MELLITUS and is not caused by reduced LIPOPROTEIN LIPASE activity as in HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA TYPE I ."
"Summary of Hyperprolinemia type 2: Hyperprolinemia type 2 results in an excess of a particular protein building block (amino acid), called proline, in the blood. This condition generally occurs when proline is not broken down properly by the body. Hyperprolinemia type 2 causes proline levels in the blood to be 10 to 15 times higher than normal, and it also causes high levels of a related compound called pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Some people with this condition develop mild intellectual disability and seizures; however, the symptoms of this disorder vary in severity among affected individuals."
Summary of Hypertrophic branchial myopathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Hypochondroplasia: Hypochondroplasia is a form of skeletal disease characterized by very short stature. Hypochondroplasia is similar to achondroplasia, but the features tend to be milder. People with Hypochondroplasia usually have very short stature, large head, accentuated lordosis, short arms and legs, and broad, short hands and feet. Other features include a limited range of motion in the elbows, lordosis, and bowed legs. Uncommon symptoms may include learning difficulties and convulsions. Hypochondroplasia is caused by genetic changes in the FGFR3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."
"Summary of Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis: Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV) is a rare form of vasculitis characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels and low levels of complement proteins in the blood. HUV causes recurrent episodes of hives (urticaria) and painful skin lesions that itch or burn. Individuals with HUV may also have systemic, multiorgan involvement, causing arthritic joint pain; pulmonary (lung) disease; ocular (eye) inflammation; kidney inflammation; or various other symptoms. Some scientists refer to the condition as HUV syndrome (HUVS) when it is more severe and there is significant systemic involvement. Other scientists call the condition HUVS in the absence of systemic disease. In some cases, the terms are used as synonyms. There appears to be controversy regarding the nomenclature and classification of HUV and HUVS, and whether they are distinct conditions or represent a continuum of the same disease. Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role in causing HUV. It generally occurs sporadically, but familial cases have been reported. It is thought to develop due to an abnormal immune system response involving specific proteins that work together to fight organisms that cause infections. In some cases HUV may be associated with an underlying infection or systemic diseases such as systemic lupus, SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, monoclonal gammopathy, or blood disorders."
"Summary of Hypokalemic periodic paralysis: Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HOKPP) is characterized by episodes of muscle paralysis associated with a fall in blood potassium levels (hypokalemia). Episodes typically involve a temporary inability to move muscles in the arms and legs. The first attack usually occurs in childhood or adolescence. Attacks can last for hours or days, and the frequency of attacks varies among people with HOKPP. HOKPP can be caused by genetic changes in the CACNA1S, SCN4A, or KCNJ18 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant."
Summary of Hypomelanotic disorder: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Hypoparathyroidism: Hypoparathyroidism is is an endocrine disorder in which the parathyroid glands in the neck do not produce enough parathyroid hormone (PTH). Common signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, brittle nails, cataracts, dry hair and skin, muscle cramps, tetany, pain in the face, legs, and feet, seizures, tingling sensation, and weakened tooth enamel (in children). It may be caused by injury to the parathyroid glands (e.g., during surgery)."
"Summary of Hypophosphatasia: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a genetic condition that causes abnormal development of the bones and teeth. The severity of HPP can vary widely, from fetal death to fractures that don't begin until adulthood. Signs and symptoms may include poor feeding and respiratory problems in infancy; short stature; weak and soft bones; short limbs; other skeletal abnormalities; and hypercalcemia. Complications can be serious. The mildest form of the condition, called odontoHypophosphatasia, only affects the teeth. HPP is caused by genetic changes in the ALPL gene. Perinatal (onset before birth) and infantile HPP are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The milder forms, especially adult forms and odontoHypophosphatasia, may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Hypophosphatemic rickets: Hypophosphatemic rickets (previously called vitamin D-resistant rickets) is a disorder in which the bones become painfully soft and bend easily, due to low levels of phosphate in the blood. Symptoms usually begin in early childhood and can range in severity. Severe forms may cause bowing of the legs and other bone deformities; bone pain; joint pain; poor bone growth; and short stature. In some affected babies, the space between the skull bones closes too soon (craniosynostosis). This sometimes results in developmental abnormalities. Hypophosphatemic rickets is almost always inherited and may be caused by changes in any of several genes. There are several forms which are distinguished by their genetic cause and pattern of inheritance. Most commonly Hypophosphatemic rickets is due to changes in the PHEX gene and inherited in an X-linked dominant manner (X-linked hypophosphatemia). Less commonly it is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner (often called Dent disease); autosomal dominant manner; or autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Panhypopituitarism, x-linked: A rare genetic pituitary disease characterized by variable deficiency of all hormones produced in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Clinical manifestations include hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, growth retardation and short stature, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Age of onset is variable. Signs and symptoms usually develop gradually, and loss of the different hormones is often sequential."
Summary of Hypoplasia of the tibia with polydactyly: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a heart condition present from birth (congenital heart defect). In HLHS, the heart's left side (including the aorta, aortic valve, left ventricle and mitral valve) is underdeveloped. At birth, oxygen-rich blood bypasses the underdeveloped left side of the heart, going through openings between the left and right side that normally close a few days after birth (the patent ductus arteriosus and the patent foramen ovale). The right side of the heart then pumps blood to the lungs and the body. Therefore, there may be no symptoms for a few days. However, when these openings close, oxygen-rich blood cannot easily get to the rest of the body. Symptoms then develop quickly, and may include problems breathing, pounding heart, weak pulse, and/or an ashen or bluish skin color. Some children with HLHS also have other heart defects, such as an atrial septal defect. In most children with HLHS, the cause is not known. In some children, isolated HLHS is known to be genetic. These cases may be due to genetic changes in the GJA1 gene with autosomal recessive inheritance, or the NKX2-5 gene with autosomal dominant inheritance. HLHS has also been reported with certain genetic disorders including Turner syndrome, Jacobsen syndrome, trisomy 13, and trisomy 18."
"Summary of Mucolipidosis type II: Mucolipidosis type II (ML II), also known as I cell disease, is a rare and progressive metabolic disorder that involves our body's ability to break down certain fats (mucolipids). Symptoms typically present in infancy or early childhood and include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental delay, limited mobility, clubfeet, thickened skin, and short hands and fingers. ML II can also cause heart valve abnormalities and repeated respiratory infections. This reduces the individual's ability to breathe effectively and typically results in death by early adolescence. ML II is caused by genetic change in the GNPTAB gene, and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. ML II is diagnosed by testing the blood or urine for high levels of mucolipids, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Ichthyosis vulgaris: Ichthyosis vulgaris is a common skin disorder passed down through families that leads to dry, scaly skin. It often begins in early childhood. Ichthyosis vulgaris can be a nuisance, but it rarely affects overall health. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
Summary of Idiopathic alveolar hypoventilation syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Idiopathic pulmonary artery dilatation: Idiopathic pulmonary artery dilatation is a rare condition that happens during embryo development. It is characterized by the widening of the main pulmonary artery. It is not caused by any other heart, lung, or artery disease. Some people may experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, coughing up blood, palpitations, and chest pain. Others may not have any symptoms at all. In severe cases, the trachea may become narrow due to changes in posture. This can lead to attacks of bluish skin and severe shortness of breath. In some cases, sudden cardiac death has been reported."
Summary of Idiopathic edema: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis: Juvenile osteoporosis is a condition of bone demineralization characterized by pain in the back and extremities, multiple fractures, difficulty walking, and evidence of osteoporosis. Symptoms typically develop just before puberty. Osteoporosis is rare in children and adolescents. This is called secondary osteoporosis. Sometimes, however, there is no identifiable cause of osteoporosis in a child. This is known as idiopathic osteoporosis. There is no established medical or surgical therapy for Juvenile osteoporosis. Early diagnosis may allow for preventive steps, including physical therapy, avoidance of weight-bearing activities, use of crutches and other supportive care. A well-balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D is also important. In severe, long-lasting cases, medications such as bisphosphonates may be used. In most cases, complete recovery of bone occurs."
"Summary of Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis: Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis is a rare disease characterized by repeated episodes of bleeding into the lungs, which can cause anemia and lung disease. The body is able to remove most of the blood from the lungs, but a large amount of iron is left behind. Over time, this iron can cause permanent damage to the lungs (fibrosis). Symptoms can resemble pneumonia and include coughing, coughing up blood (hemoptysis), difficulty breathing, and wheezing. The cause of Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis is unknown. Diagnosis is based on ruling out other kinds of pulmonary hemosiderosis, and tests may include imaging, laboratory tests, and a lung biopsy."
"Summary of Imperforate anus: Imperforate anus is a birth defect where the opening to the anus is missing or blocked. The anus, also known as the rectum, is the opening at the end of the intestines through which stool (bowel movement) leaves the body. Imperforate anus may end in a pouch, be too narrow (stenotic or atresic), or open into part of the urinary system, female or male reproductive system, or other system of body Symptoms may include absence of the first stool within 24 to 48 hours after birth, no anal opening, anal opening in an abnormal place, stool coming out from the vagina, base of penis, scrotum, or urethra, and/or swollen belly. Although the exact cause of Imperforate anus is not fully understood, it is believed to be due to the abnormal development of the rectum when the embryo is forming inside the womb. Many forms of Imperforate anus occur with other birth defects. Imperforate anus may also be part of a syndrome with multiple birth defects."
Summary of Inborn amino acid metabolism disorder: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Inborn renal aminoaciduria: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Inclusion conjunctivitis: An infection of the eyes characterized by the presence in conjunctival epithelial cells of inclusion bodies indistinguishable from those of trachoma. It is acquired by infants during birth and by adults from swimming pools. The etiological agent is CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS whose natural habitat appears to be the genito-urinary tract. Inclusion conjunctivitis is a less severe disease than trachoma and usually clears up spontaneously.
"Summary of Incontinentia pigmenti: Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a genetic condition that affects the skin and other body systems. Skin symptoms change with time and begin with a blistering rash in infancy, followed by wart-like skin growths. The growths become swirled grey or brown patches in childhood, and then swirled light patches in adulthood. Other signs and symptoms may include hair loss, small or missing teeth, eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss, and lined or pitted nails. Most people with IP have normal intelligence, but some have developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and/or other neurological problems. IP is caused by genetic changes in the IKBKG gene and is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner."
"Summary of Infantile apnea: Infantile apnea is a cessation of respiratory air flow that may affect newborns or older children because of neurological impairment of the respiratory rhythm or obstruction of air flow through the air passages. The symptoms include cyanosis, pallor or bradycardia and snoring in case of obstructive apnea."
"Summary of Infectious arthritis: Infectious arthritis is joint pain, soreness, stiffness and swelling caused by a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body. Depending on the type of infection, one or more joints may be affected. Certain bacteria can cause a form of Infectious arthritis called reactive arthritis, which appears to be caused by the immune system reacting to bacteria, rather than by the infection itself. In reactive arthritis, joint inflammation develops weeks, months or even years after the infection. Reactive arthritis happens most commonly after infections of the genital and gastrointestinal tracts. To diagnose Infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid."
Summary of Infectious myocarditis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Inflammatory breast cancer: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer in which the cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. This type of breast cancer is called 'inflammatory' because the breast often looks swollen and red, or 'inflamed.' The skin may also look dimpled like the skin of an orange. IBC can be difficult to diagnose because there is no lump to feel or detect on a mammogram. Like other types of breast cancer, IBC can occur in men, but usually at an older age than in women."
"Summary of Intestinal pseudo-obstruction: Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a digestive disorder in which the intestinal walls are unable to contract normally (called hypomotility); the condition resembles a true obstruction, but no actual blockage exists. Signs and symptoms may include abdominal pain; vomiting; diarrhea; constipation; malabsorption of nutrients leading to weight loss and/or failure to thrive; and other symptoms. It may be classified as neuropathic (from lack of nerve function) or myopathic (from lack of muscle function), depending on the source of the abnormality. The condition is sometimes inherited (in an X-linked recessive or autosomal dominant manner) and may be caused by genetic changes in the FLNA gene. It may also be acquired after certain illnesses."
"Summary of Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis: Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHI) is an unusual form of chronic (long-lasting) uveitis. Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the middle layer of the eye. Diagnosis of FHI is considered in people with floaters, vision loss, and heterochromia. FHI often affects young adults and most often involves a single eye. People with FHI are at risk for cataract, glaucoma, and vitreous opacity (clouding of the jelly-like substance in the eyeball). The cause of FHI is not known."
"Summary of Isaacs syndrome: Isaacs' syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by progressive muscle stiffness; continuously contracting or twitching muscles (myokymia); and diminished reflexes. Although the exact underlying cause is unknown, there appear to be hereditary and acquired (non-inherited) forms of the condition."
"Summary of Right sided atrial isomerism: Right sided atrial isomerism is a rare congenital condition that affects multiple organ systems of the body. Right sided atrial isomerism is classified as a heterotaxy disorder or a laterality disorder. These terms refer to the failure of the internal organs of the chest and abdomen to be arranged in the proper location within the body. It is characterized by the absence (asplenia) or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the spleen, heart malformations, and the abnormal arrangement of the internal organs of the chest and abdomen. The exact cause of Right sided atrial isomerism is not known. Most cases are sporadic (isolated and seemingly random). Unlike some other heterotaxy disorders, causative gene genetic changes have not been identified."
"Summary of Jackson-Weiss syndrome: Jackson-Weiss syndrome (JWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by specific malformations of the head and facial area and abnormalities of the feet. The range and severity of symptoms and findings may be extremely variable, and findings may include craniosynostosis; unusually flat, underdeveloped midfacial regions (midfacial hypoplasia); abnormally broad great toes; and/or malformation or fusion of certain bones within the feet. It is caused by genetic changes in the FGFR2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; in some cases, it is not inherited but results from a new genetic change that occurs randomly."
Summary of Japanese encephalitis: Japanese encephalitis is an arboviral disease (i.e. a disease due to a virus transmitted by an arthropod).
"Summary of Autosomal recessive spondylocostal dysostosis: Autosomal recessive spondylocostal dysostosis, also known as Spondylothoracic dysostosis (STD), is a rare condition that affects the bones of the spine and the ribs. The term 'Jarcho-Levin syndrome' is sometimes used as a synonym and is often used for all radiologic features that include defects of the vertebrae and abnormal rib alignment. Signs and symptoms of Autosomal recessive spondylocostal dysostosis are generally present at birth and may include short-trunk dwarfism (a short body with normal length arms and legs); a small chest cavity; misshapen and abnormally-fused vertebrae (bones of the spine); and fused ribs at the part nearest the spine. It can occur in any population; however, it occurs most frequently in people of Puerto Rican ancestry. It is caused by changes in the MESP2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Jejunal atresia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome: Autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), formerly known as Job syndrome, affects several body systems including the immune system. AD-HIES is characterized by abnormally high levels of an immune system protein called immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood. Signs and symptoms may include recurrent infections (e.g., pneumonia, skin infections), eczema, and occasionally bone and tooth abnormalities. The eczema and skin infections may cause rashes, blisters, collections of pus (abscesses), open sores, and scaling of the skin. Some cases of AD-HIES are caused by genetic changes in the STAT3 gene. In other cases, the cause is unknown."
"Summary of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3: Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) is a rare, inherited form of ataxia. Signs and symptoms may begin between childhood and late adulthood and vary greatly. Symptoms may include slowly progressive clumsiness in the arms and legs; a manner of walking (gait) that may be mistaken for drunkenness; difficulty speaking and swallowing; impaired eye movements or vision; and lower limb spasticity. Some people with SCA3 develop dystonia or symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease; twitching of the face or tongue; nerve damage (neuropathy); or problems with urination and the autonomic nervous system. SCA3 is caused by a genetic change in the ATXN3 gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Joubert syndrome: Joubert syndrome is disorder of brain development that may affect many parts of the body. It is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the cerebellar vermis (a part of the brain that controls balance and coordination) and a malformed brain stem (connection between the brain and spinal cord). Together, these cause the characteristic appearance of a molar tooth sign on MRI. Signs and symptoms can vary but commonly include weak muscle tone (hypotonia); abnormal breathing patterns; abnormal eye movements; ataxia; distinctive facial features; and intellectual disability. Various other abnormalities may also be present. Joubert syndrome may be caused by genetic changes in any of many genes. Inheritance is usually autosomal recessive, but rarely it may be X-linked recessive."
"Summary of Juvenile dermatomyositis: Juvenile dermatomyositis has some similarities to adult dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Children with Juvenile dermatomyositis may have difficulty swallowing and breathing, and the heart may also be affected. About 20 to 30 percent of children with Juvenile dermatomyositis develop calcium deposits in the soft tissue. Affected children may not show higher than normal levels of the muscle enzyme creatine kinase in their blood but have higher than normal levels of other muscle enzymes."
"Summary of Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is an epilepsy syndrome characterized by myoclonic jerks (quick jerks of the arms or legs), generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs), and sometimes, absence seizures. The seizures of Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy often occur when people first awaken in the morning. Seizures can be triggered by lack of sleep, extreme fatigue, stress, or alcohol consumption. Onset typically occurs around adolesence in otherwise healthy children. The causes of Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy are very complex and not completely understood. Genetic changes in one of several genes, including the GABRA1 and the EFHC1 genes, can cause or increase susceptibility to this condition."
"Summary of Kabuki syndrome: Kabuki syndrome is a rare disorder that affects multiple parts of the body. It is present from birth. Specific symptoms and severity can vary. Features often include a characteristic facial appearance; skeletal abnormalities; short stature; heart defects; and intellectual disability. Other signs and symptoms may include seizures, microcephaly, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), eye problems, cleft palate, and dental problems. A variety of other health problems may also occur. Kabuki syndrome is most often caused by a genetic change in the KMT2D gene, and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Some cases are due to a genetic change in the KDM6A gene and are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner."
Summary of Kallikrein hypertension: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Kaposi sarcoma: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a cancer that develops from the cells that line lymph or blood vessels. It usually appears as tumors on the skin or on mucosal surfaces such as inside the mouth, but tumors can also develop in other parts of the body (including the lymph nodes, lungs, or digestive tract). The abnormal cells of Kaposi sarcoma cause purplish, reddish blue, or dark brown/black skin lesions (macules, nodules, plaques) on the legs and the face. These lesions may look bad, but they usually cause no symptoms. However, when the lesions are in the lungs, liver, or digestive tract, they may cause serious problems like gastrointestinal bleeding or trouble breathing. Kaposi sarcoma is caused by infection with a virus called the Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8). Kaposi sarcoma is classified into four types based upon the different populations in which it develops: classic (which presents in middle or old age), endemic (described in sub-Saharan indigenous Africans), iatrogenic (associated with immunosuppressive drug therapy) and AIDS-associated (epidemic KS)."
Summary of Kartagener syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Kawasaki disease: Kawasaki disease is a disease that involves inflammation of the blood vessels. It is typically diagnosed in young children, but older children and adults can also develop this condition. Kawasaki disease begins with a fever that lasts at least five days. Other classic symptoms may include red eyes, lips, and mouth; rash; swollen and red hands and feet; and swollen lymph nodes. Sometimes the disease affects the coronary arteries which carry oxygen-rich blood to the heart, which can lead to serious heart problems. Kawasaki disease occurs most often in people of Asian and Pacific Island descent. The cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown. An infection along with genetic factors may be involved."
"Summary of Kearns-Sayre syndrome: Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a neuromuscular disorder defined by the triad of features: onset of symtpoms before age 20 years; pigmentary retinopathy (a ""salt-and-pepper"" pigmentation in the retina that can affect vision, but often leaves it intact); and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). In addition, affected individuals have at least one of the following: cardiac conduction block, cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration greater than 100 mg/dL, or cerebellar ataxia. Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion syndrome. It results from abnormalities in the DNA of mitochondria - small rod-like structures found in every cell of the body that produce the energy that drives cellular functions. This and other mitochondrial diseases correlate with specific DNA genetic changes that cause problems with many of the organs and tissues in the body, resulting in multisystem effects."
"Summary of Kennedy disease: Kennedy disease is a gradually progressive, neuromuscular disorder characterized by wasting of the proximal muscles (those closer to the trunk) and bulbar muscles (those of the face and throat). The condition mainly affects adult males. Early symptoms may include tremor, muscle cramps, and muscle twitching. This is followed by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, which may manifest in a variety of ways. Other symptoms include gynecomastia, testicular atrophy (reduction in size or function of the testes), and reduced fertility as a result of mild androgen insensitivity. Kennedy disease is caused by a genetic change in the androgen receptor (AR) gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner."
"Summary of Muir-Torre syndrome: Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is a form of Lynch syndrome and is characterized by sebaceous (oil gland) skin tumors in association with internal cancers. The most common internal site involved is the gastrointestinal tract (with almost half of affected people having colorectal cancer), followed by the genitourinary tract. Skin lesions may develop before or after the diagnosis of the internal cancer. MTS is caused by changes in the MLH1 or MSH2 genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A genetic change in either of these genes gives a person an increased lifetime risk of developing the skin changes and types of cancer associated with the condition."
"Summary of Keratoconus: Keratoconus is the degeneration of the structure of the cornea, which is the clear tissue covering the front of the eye. In this condition, the shape of the cornea slowly changes from the normal round shape to a cone shape. Most people who develop Keratoconus start out nearsighted, which tends to become worse over time. The earliest symptom is a slight blurring of vision that cannot be corrected with glasses. Over time, there may be eye halos, glare, or other night vision problems.The cause is unknown, but the tendency to develop Keratoconus is probably present from birth. Keratoconus is thought to involve a defect in collagen, the tissue that makes up most of the cornea."
"Summary of Keratomalacia: dryness with ulceration and perforation of the cornea, with absence of inflammatory reactions, occurring in cachectic children; results from severe vitamin A deficiency."
"Summary of Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans: Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans (KFSD) is a rare, inherited, skin condition. KFSD is a form of ichthyoses, a group of inherited conditions of the skin in which the skin tends to be thick and rough, and to have a scaly appearance. The face, neck, and forearms are frequently involved. The thickening of the skin is accompanied by the loss of eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair on the face and head. Allergic reactions (atopy), reduced tolerance of bright light (photophobia), and inflammation of the eye's cornea (keratitis) may also occur. KFSD is thought to be caused by genetic changes in the SAT1 gene and inherited in an X-linked manner."
"Summary of Bilirubin encephalopathy: Bilirubin encephalopathy refers to brain damage that may occur when neonatal jaundice goes untreated for too long. Physiologic neonatal jaundice (which can affect about 60% of all newborn babies) is a very common condition in which the skin and whites of the eyes are yellowish in color within a few days after birth, due to high levels of a yellow pigment (bilirubin) created when the body gets rid of old red blood cells. However, in some babies, bilirubin levels may rise excessively (hyperbilirubinemia), which can damage the brain cells. Risk factors for severe jaundice and higher bilirubin levels include premature birth (before 37 weeks); darker skin color; East Asian or Mediterranean descent; feeding difficulties; jaundice in a sibling; bruising at birth; and a mother with an O blood type or Rh negative blood factor. After a few days of jaundice, toxic levels of bilirubin in certain areas of the brain may cause signs and symptoms such as respiratory distress, muscle spasms, and/or low muscle tone (hypotonia). Other symptoms can develop as the baby gets older, such as delayed motor development, seizures, lack of coordination (ataxia), muscle spasms (dystonia), involuntary movements (athetosis), sensory problems, lack of upward gaze, hearing loss, intellectual disability, and difficulty speaking (dysarthria). The term ""Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND)"" is used for the signs and symptoms of Bilirubin encephalopathy."
"Summary of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a benign (non-cancerous) condition of the lymph nodes. The main symptoms include swollen lymph nodes in the neck, mild fever, and night sweats. Less common symptoms include weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and sore throat. While the exact cause of this condition is unknown, infectious and autoimmune causes have been suggested."
"Summary of Kimura disease: Kimura disease is a rare, noncancerous, chronic condition that causes the tissue under the skin of the head or neck to become swollen. Masses generally appear in a person's mid-20s and the disease mainly affects Asian men. Kimura disease is diagnosed by a surgical biopsy and the cause of the disease is unknown."
Summary of Segmentation syndrome 1: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Klüver-Bucy syndrome: Kluver Bucy syndrome is a rare behavioral impairment characterized by inappropriate sexual behaviors and mouthing of objects. Other signs and symptoms, include a diminished ability to visually recognize objects, loss of normal fear and anger responses, memory loss, distractibility, seizures, and dementia. It is associated with damage to the anterior temporal lobes of the brain. Cases have been reported in association with herpes encephalitis and head trauma."
"Summary of Kniest dysplasia: Kniest dysplasia is a disorder of bone growth characterized by short stature (dwarfism) with other skeletal abnormalities and problems with vision and hearing. It is one of a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by genetic changes in the COL2A1 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new genetic changes in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
"Summary of Osteochondrosis of the tarsal bone: Osteochondrosis of the tarsal bone is a condition that affects a bone at the arch of the foot called the tarsal navicular bone. X-rays show that this bone is initially compressed and later breaks into pieces before healing and hardening back into bone. Signs and symptoms of the condition include swelling, redness and/or tenderness of the affected foot which can lead to a limp or abnormal gait (style of walking). Although the exact underlying cause of Osteochondrosis of the tarsal bone is unknown, some scientists suspect that it may be caused by excessive strain on the tarsal navicular bone and its associated blood vessels before the bone is completely ossified (hardened)."
"Summary of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: ""Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a brain disorder, due to thiamine deficiency that has been associated with both Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome. Wernicke's encephalopathy represents the """"acute"""" phase and Korsakoff's syndrome represents the """"chronic"""" phase. However, they are used interchangeable in many sites. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by confusion, abnormal stance and gait (ataxia), and abnormal eye movements (nystagmus). Korsakoff's syndrome is observed in a small number of patients. It is a type of dementia, characterized by memory loss and confabulation (filling in of memory gaps with data the patient can readily recall) and involvement of the heart, vascular, and nervous system. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome mainly results from chronic alcohol use, but also from dietary deficiencies, prolonged vomiting, eating disorders, systemic diseases (cancer, AIDS, infections), bariatric surgery, transplants, or the effects of chemotherapy. Studies indicate that there may be some genetic predisposition for the disease."""
"Summary of Krabbe disease: Krabbe disease affects the development and function of the nervous system. There are several types of Krabbe disease that differ based on the age that symptoms begin. Symptoms of infantile Krabbe disease may include irritability, failure to thrive, slowed development, and unexplained fevers. Other symtoms include progressive muscle weakness, hearing and vision loss, and decreased movement. Symptoms of the later-onset types of Krabbe disease may include muscle weakness and stiffness, loss of milestones, blindness, behavior problems, dementia, and seizures. Krabbe disease is caused by genetic variants in the GALC gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, imaging studies, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Lacrimoauriculodentodigital syndrome: A rare, genetic, multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized by hypoplasia, aplasia or atresia of the lacrimal system, anomalies of the ears with sensorineural or mixed hearing loss, hypoplasia, aplasia or atresia of the salivary glands, dental anomalies, and digital malformations. Patients present obstruction of the nasal lacrimal ducts that can lead to epiphora, and chronic conjunctivitis due to alacrimia. Aplasia or hypoplasia of the salivary glands lead to dry mouth and early onset of severe dental caries. Dental features include late tooth eruption, small and peg-shaped lateral maxillary incisors and mild enamel dysplasia. The digital features are variable and include fifth finger clinodactyly, duplication of the distal phalanx of the thumb, triphalangeal thumb, and/or syndactyly. Unilateral radial aplasia and radial-ulnar synostosis have also been reported in association."
"Summary of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junction is the site where nerve cells meet muscle cells and help activate the muscles. This syndrome occurs when antibodies interfere with electrical impulses between the nerve and muscle cells. It may be associated with other autoimmune diseases, or more commonly coincide with or precede a diagnosis of cancer such as small cell lung cancer. Symptoms may include muscle weakness, a tingling sensation in the affected areas, fatigue, and dry mouth."
"Summary of Landau-Kleffner syndrome: Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) is a rare neurological syndrome characterized by the sudden or gradual development of aphasia (the inability to understand or express language) and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Males are more often affected by LKS than females. In about 20% of people with LKS, genetic changes (changes) in the GRIN2A gene have been identified. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In other cases, the syndrome may be caused by changes to other unidentified genes. LKS is diagnosed when a doctor sees clinical features that are consistent with the syndrome such as a loss of speech and an electroencephalogram (EEG) that shows specific kinds of seizure activity. Genetic testing can be used to confirm if there is a genetic change in GRIN2A, but this testing is not done routinely."
"Summary of Langerhans cell histiocytosis: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a disorder that primarily affects children, but is also found in adults of all ages. People with LCH produce too many Langerhans cells or histiocytes, a form of white blood cell found in healthy people that is supposed to protect the body from infection. In people with LCH, these cells multiply excessively and build up in certain areas of the body, causing tumors called granulomas to form. The symptoms of LCH vary from person to person, depending on the areas of the body affected. LCH may be found in many areas of the body, including but not limited to the skin and nails, mouth, bones, lymph nodes, pituitary gland, and thyroid gland. When it is found in multiple areas of the body, it is known as multisystem disease. The cause of this disease is unknown, although most data suggest that it is characterized by a growth of immature Langerhans cells that appear to have genetic changes of the BRAF gene in about half the cases. LCH is not caused by a known infection, is not contagious, nor is it believed to be inherited."
Summary of Laron syndrome: Laron syndrome is a condition that occurs when the body is unable to utilize growth hormone. It is primarily characterized by short stature. Other signs and symptoms vary but may include reduced muscle strength and endurance; hypoglycemia in infancy; delayed puberty; short limbs (arms and legs); and obesity. It is often caused by changes in the GHR gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
"Summary of Larsen syndrome: Larsen syndrome is a disorder of the development of the bones. Signs and symptoms may include clubfoot and numerous joint dislocations at birth (affecting the hips, knees and elbows); flexible joints; and a distinctive appearance of the face, hands, feet, and fingers, with square-shape finger tips. The X-rays usually show small extra bones in their wrists and ankles. Other features may include short stature, hypermobility, cleft palate, hearing loss, and an abnormal curvature of the spine that may result in weakness of the arms and/or legs and other complications. Larsen syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is caused by genetic changes in the FLNB gene."
Summary of Laryngeal cancer: A carcinoma of the larynx.
"Summary of Laryngeal papillomatosis: Laryngeal papillomatosis is a form of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis where tumors (papillomas) grow in the larynx (voice box). Symptoms usually begin with hoarseness and/or a change in the voice. Some people may experience difficulty breathing (dyspnea) and/or experience other severe complications if the papillomas block the airway. The tumors may vary in size and grow very quickly. They often grow back even when removed. Laryngeal papillomatosis is caused by two types of human papilloma virus (HPV), called HPV 6 and HPV 11."
"Summary of Congenital laryngomalacia: Congenital laryngomalacia is an abnormality of the voice box (larynx) that leads to the inward collapse of the airway when air is drawn into the lungs (inspiration). It usually becomes apparent at birth or shortly after birth. The most common symptom is noisy breathing (stridor) that is often worse when the infant is on his/her back or crying. In more severe cases, symptoms may include difficulty breathing with the chest pulling inward (retraction), poor weight gain from difficulty feeding, apnea, and cyanosis. The underlying cause of the condition is unknown. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."
Summary of Bardet-Biedl syndrome: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an inherited condition that affects many parts of the body. People with this syndrome have progressive visual impairment due to cone-rod dystrophy; extra fingers or toes (polydactyly); truncal obesity; decreased function of the male gonads (hypogonadism); kidney abnormalities; and learning difficulties. Genetic changes in many genes are known to cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome and inheritance is usually autosomal recessive.
"Summary of Long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency is a rare condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting). Signs and symptoms of LCHAD deficiency typically appear during infancy or early childhood and can include feeding difficulties, lack of energy (lethargy), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), liver problems, and abnormalities in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Later in childhood, people with this condition may experience muscle pain, breakdown of muscle tissue, and a loss of sensation in their arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy). Individuals with LCHAD deficiency are also at risk for serious heart problems, breathing difficulties, coma, and sudden death. Problems related to LCHAD deficiency can be triggered when the body is under stress, for example during periods of fasting, illnesses such as viral infections, or weather extremes. This disorder is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections. This disease summary is from MedlinePlus Genetics, an online health information resource from the National Institutes of Health."
"Summary of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a condition characterized by vision loss. Vision loss is typically the only symptom of LHON. Some families with additional signs and symptoms have been reported and are said to have ""LHON plus"", a condition which includes vision loss, tremors, and abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heartbeat (cardiac conduction defects). Some affected individuals develop features similar to multiple sclerosis. LHON is caused by genetic changes in the MT-ND1, MT-ND4, MT-ND4L, and MT-ND6 genes. LHON has a mitochondrial pattern of inheritance; however, there are many cases in which there are no other cases of LHON in the family."
"Summary of Ledderhose disease: Ledderhose disease is a type of plantar fibromatosis characterized by the growth of hard and round or flattened nodules (lumps) on the soles of the feet. It typically affects both feet and progresses slowly, but not indefinitely. The nodules are often painless at first, but may cause pain when walking as they grow. People with Ledderhose disease may also have other conditions associated with the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue such as Dupuytren contracture, knuckle pads, or Peyronie disease. Repeated trauma, long-term alcohol consumption, chronic liver disease, diabetes, and epilepsy have also been reported in association with this condition. The exact cause of Ledderhose disease is not known, but heredity is thought to play a role in many cases."
"Summary of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease: Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) occurs when blood supply to the ball of the thighbone in the hip (femoral head) is disrupted. Without an adequate blood supply, the bone cells die. Early symptoms may include limping; pain in the hip, thigh or knee; and reduced range of hip motion. Later in the disease course, there may be leg length discrepancy (one leg longer than the other) and wasting of the muscles around the hip. Some people with LCPD go on to develop degenerative arthritis in adulthood. The underlying cause of LCPD is often not known. Sometimes it results from a slipped capital femoral epiphysis, trauma, steroid use, sickle-cell crisis, toxic synovitis, or congenital hip dysplasia. It usually is not caused by genetic factors, but a few familial cases with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported."
"Summary of Legionnaires disease: Legionnaires' disease is a severe type of pneumonia caused by the bacteria Legionella. The species Legionella pneumophila causes most cases, but other species of Legionella can also cause the disease. It is named Legionnaires' disease because it was first discovered after a pneumonia outbreak among people who attended an American Legion Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1976. Most people exposed to Legionella do not become sick with Legionnaires' disease. People who do become sick usually develop symptoms within 2 to 10 days after exposure, but it may take longer. The first symptoms may include headache, chills, muscle pains, and a fever that can be 104Â°F (40Â°C) or higher. Additional symptoms usually develop 1 to 2 days after the first symptoms and may include coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and confusion. While Legionnaires' disease mainly affects the lungs, it sometimes causes infections in other parts of the body, such as the heart or within body wounds. A person can become infected from Legionella when they inhale mist or water droplets that contain the bacteria. Sources of exposure may include showers, faucets, whirlpools, grocery store misters, and water droplets passing through ventilation systems in large buildings (such as hotels, office buildings, and hospitals). People who are more susceptible to developing Legionnaires' disease after an exposure include adults over age 50, current or former smokers, and people who have a weakened immune system or a chronic disease. Generally, neither the bacteria nor Legionnaires' disease is spread directly from person to person. While large exposures can result in outbreaks, the disease usually occurs in single, isolated cases. Legionnaires' disease may be suspected by symptoms. Pneumonia can be confirmed by a chest X-ray. Legionnaires' disease is diagnosed when one of the species of Legionella is found to be the cause of the pneumonia by testing a urine sample (urine culture) or a sample of saliva and mucus that is coughed up (sputum culture)."
"Summary of Leigh syndrome: Leigh syndrome is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative condition. It usually becomes apparent in infancy, often after a viral infection. Signs and symptoms usually progress rapidly. Early symptoms may include poor sucking ability; loss of head control and motor skills; loss of appetite; vomiting; and seizures. As the condition progresses, symptoms may include weakness and lack of muscle tone; spasticity; movement disorders; cerebellar ataxia; and peripheral neuropathy. Complications can lead to impairment of respiratory, heart and kidney function. The term ""Leigh-like syndrome"" is often used for people with features that are strongly suggestive of Leigh syndrome but who do not meet the diagnostic criteria. The inheritance of Leigh syndrome depends on where the responsible gene is located in each case. This is because it can be due to genetic changes in either mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA: Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome follows a mitochondrial inheritance pattern (also called maternal inheritance). Nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked manner."
"Summary of Erythroderma desquamativum: A rare immune deficiency with skin involvement characterized by early infantile onset of a clinical tetrad comprising generalized severe seborrheic-like erythroderma, recurrent secondary bacterial or fungal infections (most commonly Staphylococcus aureus, Candida, and gram-negative bacteria), persistent, profuse malabsorptive diarrhea, and failure to thrive or marked wasting. Associated systemic symptoms include fever, anemia, and weight loss. Further critical complications are impaired thermoregulation and severe fluid loss due to extensive exfoliation."
"Summary of Leiomyosarcoma: Leiomyosarcoma is a rare cancerous tumor that consists of smooth (involuntary) muscle cells. Leiomyosarcoma is a type of sarcoma. It spreads through the blood stream and can affect the lungs, liver, blood vessels, or any other soft tissue in the body. The exact cause of Leiomyosarcoma is not known, although genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved. It is most often found in the uterus or abdomen."
"Summary of Leishmaniasis: Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease spread by the bite of infected sand flies. There are several different forms of Leishmaniasis. The most common are cutaneous and visceral. The cutaneous type causes skin sores. The visceral type affects internal organs such as the spleen, liver and bone marrow. People with this form usually have fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen and liver. Leishmaniasis is found in parts of the Middle East, Central America, South American, Asia, Africa, and southern Europe. Most of these countries are in the tropics and subtropics. It is possible but very unlikely to get this disease in the United States."
"Summary of Lemierre syndrome: Lemierre syndrome is a rare and potentially severe complication of bacterial infections that usually affects previously-healthy adolescents and young adults. It most commonly develops in association with a bacterial throat infection, but it may develop in association with an infection involving the ears, salivary glands (parotitis), sinuses, or teeth; or in association with an Epstein-Barr infection. The bacteria typically responsible for infection in Lemierre syndrome is Fusobacterium necrophorum, although a variety of bacteria can be responsible. In people with Lemierre syndrome, the initial infection spreads into tissues and deep spaces within the neck, leading to the formation of an infected blot clot (septic thrombophlebitis), sometimes made up of pus, in the internal jugular vein (the blood vessel that carries blood away from the brain, face, and neck). The infected clot then circulates in the blood (septicemia), resulting in the infection also spreading to the lungs (most commonly), skeletal system, and/or other parts of the body such as the spleen, liver, kidney, heart, or brain. This can lead to severe complications such as respiratory distress syndrome due to pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lung), damage to other affected organs, and/or septic shock (in about 7% of cases). Lemierre syndrome may be diagnosed based on signs and symptoms, various blood tests, and imaging studies."
"Summary of Leprechaunism: Leprechaunism is a congenital (present from birth) condition characterized by extreme insulin resistance, pre- and postnatal growth delays, characteristic facial features, skin abnormalities, muscular hypotrophy (reduced muscle mass) and enlarged external genitalia in both males and females. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the insulin receptor gene (INSR) gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Leprosy: Hansen's disease (also known as leprosy) is a rare bacterial infection that affects the skin, nerves and mucous membranes. Once present, common signs and symptoms include skin lesions; muscle weakness or paralysis; eye problems that may lead to blindness; nosebleeds; severe pain; and/or numbness in the hands, feet, arms and legs. Hansen's disease is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae; however, the way in which the bacterium is transmitted (spread) is poorly understood. It appears that only about 5% of people are susceptible to the condition."
"Summary of Leukemia subleukemic: Infiltration of the skin and subcutaneous tissue by leukemic cells without evidence of leukemia in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. It results in clinically identifiable skin lesions. It may be the first manifestation of acute leukemia, preceding the involvement of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by the leukemic process."
"Summary of Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I: Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I (LAD-I) is a form of LAD (see this term) characterized by life-threatening, recurrent bacterial infections."
"Summary of Leukodystrophy: A Leukodystrophy is a type of rare genetic disorder that affects the brain, spinal cord, and other nerves in the body. It is caused by destruction of the white matter of the brain. The white matter degrades due to defects of the myelin, which is a fatty covering that insulates nerves in the brain. Myelin is needed to protect the nerves and the nerves can't function normally without it. These disorders are progressive, meaning they tend to get worse with time. The leukodystrophies are a group of disorders caused by spelling mistakes in the genes involved in making myelin. Specific leukodystrophies include metachromatic Leukodystrophy, Krabbe Leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoLeukodystrophy, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Canavan disease, and Alexander disease. The most common symptom of a Leukodystrophy is a decline in functioning of an infant or child who previously appeared healthy. This gradual loss may be seen with issues in body tone, movements, gait, speech, ability to eat, vision, hearing, and behavior."
"Summary of Leukoplakia: Leukoplakia is a condition in which thickened, white patches form on the tongue, gums, inside of the cheek, or sometimes on the outer female genitals. Although the sores can vary in appearance, they are usually white or gray; thick; and slightly raised with a hard surface. The condition is thought to be caused by irritation, but the cause is not always known. Tobacco is considered to be the main cause of its development in the mouth. Most patches are benign, but a small percentage show early signs of cancer. Removing the source of irritation may cause the condition to go away, but surgery to remove the sore(s) may be necessary in some cases."
"Summary of Levator syndrome: Levator syndrome is characterized by sporadic pain in the rectum caused by spasm of a muscle near the anus (the levator ani muscle). The muscle spasm causes pain that typically is not related to defecation. The pain usually lasts less than 20 minutes. Pain may be brief and intense or a vague ache high in the rectum. It may occur spontaneously or with sitting and can waken a person from sleep. In severe cases, the pain can persist for many hours and can recur frequently. A person may have undergone various unsuccessful rectal operations to relieve these symptoms."
"Summary of Lhermitte-Duclos disease: Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD) is a very rare, benign (non-cancerous) brain tumor, called a dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum, that is characterized by abnormal development and enlargement of the cerebellum, and an increased intracranial pressure. LDD manifests most commonly in the third and fourth decades of life. Symptoms may include headache, nausea, cerebellar dysfunction, hydrocephalus, ataxia (problems with movement and coordination), and visual disturbances. Other features may include an enlarged brain (megalencephaly), hydromyelia, extra fingers or toes (polydactyly), partial gigantism, and/or a large tongue (macroglossia). Lhermitte-Duclos disease can occur as an isolated condition; it is also associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome called Cowden disease. Although the exact cause is unknown, genetic changes in the PTEN gene have been identified in some individuals with LDD."
"Summary of Li-Fraumeni syndrome: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited condition that is characterized by an increased risk for certain types of cancer. Affected people often develop cancer at an earlier age than expected and may be diagnosed with more than one cancer during their lifetime. LFS is primarily associated with sarcomas (cancers of muscle, bone or connective tissue), breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia and adrenocortical carcinoma; however, many other types of cancer have been reported in people with this condition. It is caused by changes in the TP53 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Lichen sclerosus: Lichen sclerosus (LS) affects the skin leading to scarring around the genital and anal areas. It mainly affects the skin around the vagina, anus, and tip of the penis. Symptoms can include white lesions or plaques, pain during urination, itching, and pain during intercourse. Some people have no symptoms, while others may experience itchiness (sometimes severe), discomfort, or blistering. The underlying cause of Lichen sclerosus is not known, but it is thought to relate to an autoimmune process. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and clinical exam. A skin biopsy may be done to confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Light chain deposition disease: Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of specific proteins (monoclonal light chains) in the kidneys and other organs. Light chains are used to make antibodies that the body needs to fight infection. People with LCDD make too many light chains, which get deposited in many body tissues. While LCDD can occur in any organ, the kidneys are always involved. Signs and symptoms of LCDD may include protein in the urine; decreased kidney function; and/or nephrotic syndrome. Rarely, a person with LCDD may have symptoms from cardiac (heart) or liver involvement. The underlying cause of LCDD is unknown. It is often associated with multiple myeloma. LCDD may progress to multiple myeloma, or it may be present with multiple myeloma when it is first diagnosed."
Summary of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of disorders which affect the voluntary muscles around the hips and shoulders. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. Most forms of limb girdle muscular dystrophy are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Several rare forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. There are at least 20 different types of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.
Summary of Lipogranulomatosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Liposarcoma: Liposarcoma is a tumor that arises from fat tissue. This tumor often occurs in the thigh, legs, behind the knee, or in the abdomen, but it can be found in other parts of the body, in the retroperitoneum; and, less often, in the head and neck area. Their primary occurrence in the skin is rare. Because a Liposarcoma may grow into surrounding tissues or organs, it is considered a malignant tumor. Most patients with Liposarcoma have no symptoms until the tumor is large and invades the neighboring organs or tissues, causing tenderness, pain, or functional problems."
"Summary of Lissencephaly type 1 due to doublecortin gene mutation: Lissencephaly type 1 due to doublecortin gene mutation is a disease that affects the brain. It can cause variable symptoms, including intellectual disability and seizures. This disease is caused by changes in the doublecortin (DCX) gene. It is more severe in males than in females."
"Summary of Listeriosis: A Listeria infection or listeriosis is an infection caused by a bacteria known as Listeria monocytogenes. It mainly affects newborn infants, elderly patients, pregnant women and patients who have low immunity. Listeria can be spread by several methods. A common cause is ingestion (food-borne transmission) of unpasteurized milk or contaminated vegetables. It can also be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy or directly to the newborn at the time of delivery. Listeriosis can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the person and the part of the body affected. Pregnant women typically have only fever and other flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle aches. However, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or severe infection of the newborn, including generalized infection (sepsis) or inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain (meningitis). Sometimes listeriosis involves many organs and presents with masses filled with pus (microabscesses or granulomas). Older children with Listeria infections frequently develop meningitis."
"Summary of Locked-in syndrome: Locked-in syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by complete paralysis of voluntary muscles, except for those that control the eyes. People with Locked-in syndrome are conscious and can think and reason, but are unable to speak or move. Vertical eye movements and blinking can be used to communicate. Locked-in syndrome may be caused by brain stem stroke, traumatic brain injury, tumors, diseases of the circulatory system (bleeding), diseases that destroy the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells (like multiple sclerosis), infection, or medication overdose."
Summary of Loin pain hematuria syndrome: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Long QT syndrome: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Lymph Node Neoplasm: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Lymphangiectasis: A transient dilatation of the lymphatic vessels.
"Summary of Lymphocytic colitis: Lymphocytic colitis is form of microscopic colitis, a condition that is characterized by inflammation of the colon (large intestines). As the name suggests, microscopic colitis can only be diagnosed by examining a small sample of colon tissue under a microscope. In Lymphocytic colitis, specifically, the tissues and lining of the colon are of normal thickness, but an increase in the number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) is observed. Signs and symptoms of the condition may include chronic, watery diarrhea; abdominal pain, cramping, and bloating; weight loss; nausea; dehydration; and/or fecal incontinence. The underlying cause of Lymphocytic colitis is currently unknown; however, scientists suspect that autoimmune conditions, medications, infections, genetic factors, and/or bile acid malabsorption may contribute to the development of the condition."
"Summary of Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin: Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin is a skin condition characterized by small, red, bumps on the face, neck, and upper back. The bumps usually last for several months or longer and can enlarge to create a red plaque. Typically, there are no other symptoms, although rarely, individuals may experience burning or itching. The symptoms may fluctuate between periods of worsening and periods of improvement. Some cases of Lymphocytic infiltrate of Jessner have been associated with borrelia infection (the bacteria that causes Lyme disease); however, in most instances, the cause is not known."
"Summary of Lymphocytic vasculitis: Lymphocytic vasculitis is one of several skin conditions which are collectively referred to as cutaneous vasculitis. In Lymphocytic vasculitis, white blood cells (lymphocytes) cause damage to blood vessels in the skin. This condition is thought to be caused by a number of factors, but the exact cause of most cases is not known. This disease can present with a variety of symptoms, depending on the size, location, and severity of the affected area. In a minority of patients, cutaneous vasculitis can be part of a more severe vasculitis affecting other organs in the body - this is known as systemic vasculitis."
"Summary of Lymphomatoid granulomatosis: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare disorder characterized by an overproduction of white blood cells known as B lymphocytes. These B cells can build up in the tissues of the body, causing damage to the blood vessels. In many cases of Lymphomatoid granulomatosis, the abnormal B cells contain the Epstein-Barr virus. The disease is more common in men, usually after the fifth decade of life. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis most commonly affects the lungs, though other areas of the body may also be affected. Signs and symptoms vary but can include cough, shortness of breath, tightness of the chest, fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Skin lesions and central nervous system changes such as headaches, seizures, and ataxia may also be seen. Rarely, the disorder can affect the kidneys or liver. The cause of the disorder is not well understood, though a combination of genetic and immune factors are thought to play a part."
"Summary of Lymphomatoid papulosis: Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a non-contagious, chronic skin condition characterized by the eruption of recurring, self-healing bumps (lesions) on the skin. The lesions typically begin small and then become larger, and they may bleed or ulcerate before becoming scaly and crusty. They often develop a red-brown color. Symptoms associated with lesions may include itching and/or pain, which may be debilitating. The frequency of eruptions varies over time and from person to person. Lesions may be very persistent, or they may go away for long periods of time before coming back. They may occur anywhere on the body, but they typically develop on the trunk, arms, and legs, and may develop on the hands, face, and genitalia. They generally go away on their own over a period of weeks to months (usually between 3 and 8 weeks), with or without scarring. LyP is not contagious. The cause of LyP is not known, but there is no evidence that it is hereditary. Stress is often reported to trigger eruptions of lesions. A diagnosis of LyP requires evaluating the symptoms and having a skin biopsy for various types of laboratory tests. While LyP usually is not classified as a cancer (although there has been some debate), it has characteristics of lymphoma under the microscope, and people with LyP have a life-long increased risk of developing lymphoma such as mycosis fungoides, PC-ALCL, or Hodgkin lymphoma. In 5 to 20 percent of people with LyP, the condition is either preceded by lymphoma, associated with lymphoma, or followed by lymphoma. When LyP is diagnosed it is important to rule out these cancers, and for this reason, various blood tests or imaging studies may also be recommended."
Summary of Lymphomatous thyroiditis: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Lymphosarcoma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Megalencephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria syndrome: A rare developmental defect during embryogenesis that is characterized by growth dysregulation with overgrowth of the brain and multiple somatic tissues, with capillary skin malformations, megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG), cortical brain abnormalities (in particular polymicrogyria), typical facial dysmorphisms, abnormalities of somatic growth with asymmetry of the body and brain, developmental delay and digital anomalies."
"Summary of Macrodactyly of toes: A rare non-syndromic limb overgrowth characterized by isolated congenital enlargement of some or all tissue elements of one or more digits of a foot. Enlargement may be progressive with disproportionate or static with proportionate growth and can be unilateral or bilateral. It typically occurs within a peripheral nerve territory, with the nerve itself being elongated, as well as increased in diameter."
"Summary of Macular corneal dystrophy: Macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) is a rare, severe form of stromal corneal dystrophy (see this term) characterized by bilateral ill-defined cloudy regions within a hazy stroma, and eventually severe visual impairment."
"Summary of Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare fatal brain disorder that usually occurs later in life and runs a rapid course. In the early stages of the disease, patients may have failing memory, behavior changes, impaired coordination, and vision problems. As CJD progresses, mental deterioration becomes severe, and they can have uncontrolled movements, blindness, weakness, and go into a coma. CJD can be very difficult to diagnose because it is similar to other forms of dementia. The only way to confirm the diagnosis is to test a small sample of brain tissue, which can be done by brain biopsy or autopsy. CJD is caused by the build up of abnormal prion proteins in the brain. For most patients, the reason for the abnormal prions is unknown (sporadic CJD). About 5 to 10 percent of cases are due to an inherited genetic change associated with CJD (familial CJD). This condition can also be acquired through contact with infected brain tissue (iatrogenic CJD) or consuming infected beef (variant CJD)."
"Summary of Multiple symmetric lipomatosis: Multiple symmetric lipomatosis is a rare condition characterized by the symmetric growth of fatty tumors (lipomas) around the neck, shoulders, upper arms and/or upper trunk. Non-alcoholics and women can also be affected. The signs and symptoms vary greatly from person to person. Usually, accumulation of fatty tissue increases over time and may lead to a loss of neck mobility and pain. The lipomas can cause physical deformity and peripheral neuropathy, when they compress a nerve. In the majority of cases, the condition does not lead to cancer; however, lipomas can become cancerous in rare circumstances. The exact cause of the condition is unknown, but it may be associated with genetic changes in mitochondrial DNA."
"Summary of Maffucci syndrome: Maffucci syndrome is a disorder that primarily affects the bones and skin. It is characterized by multiple enchondromas (benign enlargements of cartilage), bone deformities, and hemangiomas (tangles of abnormal of blood vessels). The abnormal growths associated with Maffucci syndrome may become cancerous (malignant). In particular, affected individuals may develop bone cancers called chondrosarcomas, especially in the skull. They also have an increased risk of other cancers, such as ovarian or liver cancer. The underlying cause of Maffucci syndrome is unknown. No specific genes related to this disorder have been identified."
"Summary of Mal de débarquement: Mal de debarquement syndrome is a neurological disorder that most commonly develops following an ocean cruise or other type of water travel and less commonly following air travel, train travel, or other motion experiences. The symptoms typically reported include: persistent sensation of motion such as rocking, swaying, and/or bobbing, difficulty maintaining balance, anxiety, fatigue, unsteadiness, and difficulty concentrating. Symptoms may or may not go away with time; however, they may reoccur following another motion experience or during periods of stress or illness."
"Summary of Malakoplakia: Malakoplakia is a rare chronic inflammatory disease. It most commonly involves the urogenital system (reproductive organs and urinary system), but may also be found in other regions of the body, including the pelvis, bones, lungs, thyroid gland, gastrointestinal (digestive) tract, skin, and kidneys. Symptoms of Malakoplakia differ depending on the involved area. For example, when the skin is affected the Malakoplakia may appear rash-like with small areas of itchy, reddened skin that may be painful and/or fluid filled. The cause of Malakoplakia is not well understood. It is thought to be related to an issue with the function of one's macrophages, which are one type of cell within the immune system that respond to foreign invaders (bacteria). E.coli is the most common type of bacteria that leads to Malakoplakia. Individuals with a compromised immune system have an elevated risk to develop Malakoplakia."
"Summary of Malaria: Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type of mosquito which feeds on humans. Infection with Malaria parasites may result in a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from absent or very mild symptoms to severe disease and even death. People who get Malaria are typically very sick with high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like illness."
"Summary of Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma: An aggressive sarcoma of soft tissues or bone that can arise from any part of the body, clinically presenting as swelling, mass, pain, pathological fracture and occasional systemic features and is characterized by high local recurrence and significant metastasis."
"Summary of Malignant hyperthermia of anesthesia: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) of anesthesia is a severe reaction to certain gases used during anesthesia and/or a muscle relaxant used to temporarily paralyze a person during surgery. Signs and symptoms of MH include marked hyperthermia, a rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, acidosis, muscle rigidity, and breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). People who are at increased risk for this reaction are said to have MH susceptibility. Susceptibility to MH of anesthesia may be caused by genetic changes in any of several genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. People with certain inherited muscle diseases (e.g., central core disease and multiminicore disease) also have MH of anesthesia susceptibility."
"Summary of Malignant mixed Mullerian tumor: Malignant mixed Mullerian tumor (MMMT), also called a carcinosarcoma, is a type of cancer that contains two types of cancer cells - carcinoma and sarcoma cells. These tumors usually develop in tissues of the female genital tract. The majority of these tumors arise in the uterus, though they can also occur in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and cervix. Very rarely, MMMTs can develop in the female peritoneum (lining of the abdominal wall)."
"Summary of Mallory-Weiss syndrome: A condition characterized by mucosal tears at the ESOPHAGOGASTRIC JUNCTION, sometimes with HEMATEMESIS. Typically it is caused by forceful bouts of retching or VOMITING."
"Summary of Alpha-mannosidosis: Alpha mannosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder, a form of inborn metabolic disease. It is characterized by intellectual disability, hearing loss, ataxia, skeletal abnormalities, and coarse facial features.Signs and symptoms vary, but often include mild to moderate intellectual disability, hearing loss, weakened immune system, distinctive facial features, and cerebellar disorders (e.g., ataxia). Symptoms slowly worsen over time. Alpha mannosidosis is caused by a genetic changes in the MAN2B1 gene, which codifies a type of enzyme (lysosomal alpha-mannosidase), that degrade glycoproteins (proteins attached to sugar residues) into smaller fragments. The lack or deficiency of this enzyme results in the toxic build-up of sugars (i.e., mannose-containing oligosaccharides) in the cells of the body. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Mantle cell lymphoma: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) belongs to a group of diseases known as non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). NHL's are cancers that affect the the lymphatic system (part of the immune system). In MCL, there are cancerous B-cells (a type of immune system cell). The cancerous B-cells are within a region of the lymph node known as the mantle zone. Although MCLs are slow-growing cancers, the cancer is usually widespread by the time it is diagnosed."
"Summary of Marchiafava-Bignami disease: Marchiafava Bignami disease is defined by characteristic demyelination of the corpus callosum (erosion of the protective covering of nerve fibers joining the 2 hemispheres of the brain). The disease seems to most often affect severe and chronic alcoholics in their middle or late adult life. Early symptoms may include depression, paranoia, psychosis, or dementia. Seizures are common, and hemiparesis, aphasia, abnormal movements, and ataxia may sometimes progress to coma and/or death. The cause of Marchiafava Bignami disease, including the potential role of nutritional deficiency, remains unknown."
"Summary of Marcus-Gunn syndrome: Marcus Gunn phenomenon is a rare condition characterized by movement of the upper eyelid in a rapid rising motion (a ""wink"") each time the jaw moves. The wink phenomenon may be elicited by opening the mouth, thrusting the jaw to the side, jaw protrusion, chewing, smiling, or sucking. It is usually present at birth and may occur with other eye abnormalities (such as strabismus) or vision problems. Although it usually affects one eye, it can affect both eyes in rare cases. The exact cause is not known. Marcus Gunn phenomenon is generally sporadic, but familial cases have been reported."
"Summary of Marden-Walker syndrome: Marden-Walker syndrome (MWS) is a genetic condition affecting the connective tissue. Features may include distinctive facial features, a cleft or high-arched palate, a small or receding jaw (micrognathia), fixed bone joints (contractures or arthrogryposis), and growth delay. Other symptoms may include a mask-like face with a narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), low-set ears, failure to thrive, and a generalized slowing down of physical reactions, movements, and speech. The cause of MWS is unknown. A few individuals have been found to have a PIEZO2 gene that is not working correctly. It is likely inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This condition is diagnosed by a clinical exam and other medical tests."
"Summary of Marek disease: A viral infection in chickens caused by the herpes virus. It is characterized by tissue lymphocytic infiltration, limb paralysis and development of tumors."
"Summary of Marfan syndrome type 1: Marfan syndrome type 1 is a disorder of the connective tissue. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body. These structures include bones, ligaments, muscles, walls of blood vessels, and heart valves. Marfan syndrome type 1 affects most organs and tissues. It especially affects the skeleton, lungs, eyes, and heart. It also significantly affects the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). It is caused by genetic changes in the FBN1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome type 1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Approximately 25% of cases are due to a new (de novo) genetic change."
"Summary of Marshall syndrome: Marshall syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, eye abnormalities, hearing loss, and early-onset arthritis. Individuals who have Marshall syndrome can also have short stature. Marshall syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the COL11A1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."
"Summary of Marshall-Smith syndrome: Marshall-Smith syndrome (MRSHSS) is a genetic disorder in which individuals typically have advanced bone age, difficulties gaining weight (failure to thrive), unique facial features, and intellectual disability. Other signs and symptoms of this condition may include eye abnormalities, breathing difficulties, and neurological issues. Individuals may also have heart defects, an increased amount of body hair (hirsutism), and flat feet (pes planus). MRSHSS is caused by genetic changes in the NFIX gene. Most individuals with MRSHSS are the first in their family with this condition and are said to have a spontaneous (de novo) genetic change."
"Summary of MASA syndrome: A X-linked, clinical subtype of L1 syndrome, characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability, delayed development of speech, hypotonia progressing to spasticity or spastic paraplegia, adducted thumbs, and mild to moderate distension of the cerebral ventricles."
"Summary of Mastocytosis: Mastocytosis occurs when too many mast cells accumulate in the skin and/or internal organs such as the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and small intestines. Mast cells are a type of white blood cell in the immune system. Mast cells are responsible for protecting the body from infection and releasing chemicals to create inflammatory responses. The signs and symptoms of Mastocytosis vary based on which parts of the body are affected. There are two main forms of Mastocytosis. Cutaneous Mastocytosis only affects the skin and is more common in children. Systemic Mastocytosis affects more than one part of the body and is more common in adults. Mastocytosis is usually caused by changes (known as variationss) in the KIT gene. Most cases are caused by somatic genetic changes, meaning they only occur in certain parts of the body and are not inherited or passed on to the next generation. However, mastocystosis can rarely affect more than one person in a family. Mastocysotis may be suspected when a doctor sees a person has signs and symptoms of the disease. Diagnosis may be confirmed with a skin biopsy or bone marrow biopsy."
Summary of Maxillofacial dysostosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Maxillonasal dysplasia: Binder syndrome is a rare developmental anomaly, affecting primarily the anterior part of the maxilla and nasal complex."
"Summary of McCune-Albright syndrome: McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a disorder that affects the skin, skeleton, and certain endocrine organs (hormone-producing tissues). Cafe-au-lait spots of the skin are common and are usually the first apparent sign of MAS. The main skeletal feature is fibrous dysplasia, which ranges in severity and can cause various complications. Early skeletal symptoms may include limping, pain, or fracture. Endocrinous features may include precocious puberty especially in girls (resulting of estrogen excess from ovarian cysts),  excess growth hormone; thyroid lesions with possible hyperthyroidism; renal phosphate wasting, and, rarely, Cushing syndrome caused by an excess of the hormone cortisol produced by the adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney. MAS is not inherited. MAS is caused by a somatic genetic change in a gene called GNAS, which is acquired after an egg is fertilized and only affects some of the body's cells and tissues."
"Summary of Cartilage-hair hypoplasia: Cartilage-hair hypoplasia is a disorder of bone growth characterized by short stature (dwarfism) with other skeletal abnormalities; fine, sparse hair (hypotrichosis); and abnormal immune system function (immune deficiency) that can lead to recurrent infections. Signs and symptoms may vary among affected individuals. People with this condition are also at an increased risk of developing cancer, particularly blood, skin, and immune system cancers. Gastrointestinal problems are also common. Cartilage-hair hypoplasia is caused by genetic changes in the RMRP gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of MUC1-related autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease: Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease due to MUC1 mutations (ADTKD-MUC1) is an inherited disorder that causes a gradual loss of kidney function. This condition is not associated with any symptoms outside of the kidney. ADTKD-MUC1 is caused by a mistake in the MUC1 gene that leads to production of an abnormal mucin 1 protein, which deposits in the kidney and leads to slow loss of kidney function ADTKD-MUC1 is inherited in families in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is diagnosed based on laboratory testing, family history and genetic testing. ADTKD-MUC1 is very rare. Some patients may do well for a long time without any symptoms and may not require kidney transplant or dialysis until later in life."
Summary of Medullary thyroid carcinoma: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is developed from thyroid C cells that secrete calcitonin (CT).
"Summary of Medulloblastoma: A rare embryonic tumor of the neuroepithelial tissue characterized clinically by increased intracranial pressure and cerebellar dysfunction, with the most common presenting symptoms being headache, vomiting, and ataxia. The disease can be classified according to histological (classic, anaplastic, large-cell, or desmoplatic medulloblastoma, or medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity) and molecular criteria (WNT-activated, sonic-hedgehog-activated, group 3, group 4)."
"Summary of Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome: Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome (IGS) is a rare condition characterized by vitamin B12 deficiency, often causing megaloblastic anemia. IGS usually appears in childhood. Other features may include failure to thrive, infections, and neurological damage. Mild proteinuria (with no signs of kidney disease) is present in about half of affected individuals. IGS is caused by genetic changes in either the CUBN or AMN gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia syndrome: Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia syndrome is a rare, neurological condition characterized by blepharospasm (abnormal movement of the eyelids); oromandibular dystonia (spasms in the jaw and tongue); and sometimes, cervical dystonia. Symptoms and severity can vary. The exact cause of Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia syndrome is unknown."
"Summary of MELAS: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) affects many parts of the body, particularly the brain and nervous system (encephalo-) and muscles (myopathy). Symptoms typically begin in childhood and may include muscle weakness and pain, recurrent headaches, loss of appetite, vomiting, and seizures. People with MELAS can also have a buildup of lactic acid in their bodies that can lead to vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, muscle weakness, and difficulty breathing. The genes associated with MELAS are located in mitochondrial DNA and therefore follow a maternal inheritance pattern (also called mitochondrial inheritance). MELAS can be inherited from the mother only, because only females pass mitochondrial DNA to their children. In some cases, MELAS results from a new genetic change that was not inherited from a person's mother."
"Summary of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome: Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is a rare, inherited syndrome that affects the nervous system and skin (a neurocutaneous syndrome). MRS may be characterized by three main features: recurrent facial nerve palsy, episodes of swelling of the face and lips, and fissuring of the tongue (formation of deep grooves). The majority of people with MRS only have one or two of these features, rather than all three. MRS is more common in females than in males. Inheritance of MRS is autosomal dominant, but a consistent genetic cause has not been found. It is possible that more than one gene is responsible for MRS, and/or that environmental ""triggers"" may contribute to causing the syndrome in some genetically predisposed individuals. In some cases, MRS may be associated with Crohn's disease or sarcoidosis. MRS is diagnosed based on the symptoms present and medical history, and a biopsy of the lips may be needed to confirm the diagnosis in some cases."
"Summary of Melnick-Needles syndrome: Melnick-Needles syndrome is a rare disorder involving abnormalities in skeletal development and other health problems. It is a member of a group of related conditions called otopalatodigital spectrum disorders, which typically involve hearing loss caused by malformations in the tiny bones in the ears (ossicles), problems in the development of the roof of the mouth (palate), and skeletal abnormalities involving the fingers and/or toes (digits). Melnick-Needles syndrome is usually the most severe of the otopalatodigital spectrum disorders and males with this condition generally have more severe signs and symptoms than females. In almost all instances, males with Melnick-Needles syndrome die before or soon after birth. The signs and symptoms of this condition may include: short stature, various skeletal abnormalities, characteristic facial features, and abnormalities of the heart and/or kidneys. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the FLNA gene, and it is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner."
"Summary of Meningioma: Meningiomas are tumors that originate in the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Most Meningiomas are not cancerous (benign), though a minority of Meningiomas can be classified as atypical or cancerous (malignant). Though rare, malignant Meningiomas can be highly aggressive. However, even benign Meningiomas can cause problems if their growth affects neighboring areas of the brain. Though most Meningiomas grow slowly, there is no way to predict the rate of growth for a particular Meningioma or to know how long a specific Meningioma was growing before it was diagnosed. Signs and symptoms can vary but may include seizures, headaches, weakness in the arms and legs, and vision loss. Sometimes memory loss, carelessness, and unsteadiness are the only symptoms."
"Summary of Mercury poisoning: Mercury poisoning is a condition that occurs in people who are exposed to toxic levels of the element, mercury. There are three different forms of mercury that can cause health problems. Elemental mercury (also known as liquid mercury or quicksilver) can be found in glass thermometers, electrical switches, dental fillings and fluorescent light bulbs. This form of mercury is generally only harmful when small droplets become airborne and are inhaled. If this occurs, signs and symptoms of poisoning may include metallic taste, vomiting, difficulty breathing, coughing, and/or swollen, bleeding gums. Inorganic mercury is found in batteries, chemistry labs, and some disinfectants. This form of mercury is harmful when swallowed. Signs and symptoms of inorganic Mercury poisoning vary based on the amount consumed, but may include burning in the stomach and throat; vomiting; and/or bloody diarrhea. Inorganic mercury can also affect the kidneys and brain if it enters the blood stream. Organic mercury can be found in fish. Some organisms convert fumes from burning coal into organic mercury. This form of mercury is harmful if inhaled, eaten, or placed on the skin for long periods of time. Long-term exposure to organic mercury may result in skin numbness or pain; tremor; inability to walk well; blindness; double vision; memory problems; or seizures."
"Summary of Pleural mesothelioma: Pleural mesothelioma is a form of cancer that develops in the thin layer of tissue that surrounds the lungs, chest wall, or abdomen. Signs and symptoms of the condition can vary and often depend on which area of the body is affected. Common features include abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, chest pain, coughing, fatigue, shortness of breath, and/or weight loss. Pleural mesothelioma is thought to be caused by long-term exposure to asbestos (a fire-resistant material that was once commonly found in insulation; ceiling and roof vinyls; cement; and automotive brake materials). If surgery is not an option, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may still be recommended to help alleviate some of the associated symptoms."
"Summary of Metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, Schmid type: Metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, Schmid type (MCDS) is a type of skeletal disorder in which there is abnormal bone formation at the end of the long bones (metaphyses). Symptoms include short stature with abnormally short arms and legs (short-limbed dwarfism) and bowed legs (genu varum). Additional signs and symptoms may include lumbar lordosis, leg pain, joint pain, hip deformities, and an outward flaring of the bones of the lower rib cage. As a result of the hip and leg findings, individuals with this condition may have an unusual walk that resembles a waddle. The condition is often mistaken for vitamin D-deficient rickets. MCDS is caused by a genetic change in one of the collagen genes known as COL10A1. The genetic change may be inherited from a parent or may happen for the first time in an affected individual. The MCDS genetic change is passed on in an autosomal dominant manner."
Summary of Metastatic insulinoma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Methylmalonic acidemia: Methylmalonic acidemia refers to a group of inherited conditions in which the body can't breakdown certain parts of proteins and fats. This leads to a build-up of toxic substances and bouts of serious illness called decompensation events or metabolic crises. Symptoms of a decompensation event include poor feeding, vomiting, trouble breathing, and lack of energy (lethargy). These can occur at different ages and can range from mild to severe. Methylmalonic acidemia is caused by changes in several different genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Long-term complications can include growth delay, intellectual disability, kidney disease, and pancreatitis. Methylmalonic acidemia can be isolated or may occur along with another condition called homocystinuria."
"Summary of Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition in which an abnormal protein called monoclonal protein is detected in the blood. MGUS typically does not cause any problems, although some affected people may experience numbness, tingling or weakness. In some cases, MGUS may progress over time to certain forms of blood cancer (such as multiple myeloma, macroglobulinemia, or B-cell lymphoma). MGUS is thought to be a multifactorial condition that is likely associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. People with MGUS are usually monitored closely to ensure that the levels of monoclonal protein do not rise and other problems do not develop."
"Summary of Multiple osteochondromas: Hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO), also called hereditary multiple exostoses, is a genetic disorder that causes the development of multiple, cartilage-covered tumors on the external surfaces of bones (osteochondromas). The osteochondromas typically become apparent during childhood or adolescence, and the number, size and location of osteochondromas varies from person to person. Signs and symptoms may include pain, decreased range of motion, nerve impingement, deformity, differences in limb length, short stature, and fractures. Osteochondromas of the ribs may cause complications such as a collapsed lung (pneumothorax), hemothorax, or pericardial effusion. Osteochondromas typically grow throughout childhood and stop growing when the growth plates close. However, they do recur later on in some people. While the vast majority of osteochondromas are benign (noncancerous), they may become malignant (cancerous) in adulthood in 2% to 5% of people with HMO. Most cases of HMO are caused by a genetic change in the EXT1 or EXT2 gene with autosomal dominant inheritance. About 96% of females with a genetic change responsible for HMO will develop osteochondromas (a phenomenon known as reduced penetrance), and 100% of males will develop osteochondromas."
"Summary of Microcephaly with chorioretinopathy, autosomal dominant form: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Microencephaly: A congenital abnormality in which the CEREBRUM is underdeveloped, the fontanels close prematurely, and, as a result, the head is small. (Desk Reference for Neuroscience, 2nd ed.)"
"Summary of Microvillus inclusion disease: Microvillus inclusion disease is an intestinal disorder characterized by severe, watery diarrhea and an inability of the intestines to absorb nutrients. Without adequate water and nutrients, children with this condition can become dehydrated, suffer from malnutrition, and fail to grow and develop normally. Microvillus inclusion disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Extranodal nasal NK/T cell lymphoma: Extranodal nasal NK/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a rare type of cancer that mostly affects men in their 50s. It usually starts in the nose, sinuses, eyes, or upper airway. The symptoms of NKTCL include:a mass in the nose, nasal bleeding, and difficulty breathing through the nose. It can also cause a hole in the roof of the mouth and lesions that damage the face or upper airway. In advanced stages of the disease, NKTCL can spread to other parts of the body, which makes it harder to treat. Some cases of NKTCL start in the lymph nodes."
"Summary of IgG4-related dacryoadenitis and sialadenitis: IgG4-related dacryoadenitis and sialoadenitis (formerly called Mikulicz disease) is an IgG4-related disease characterized by inflammation of the lacrimal glands (which produce tears), parotid glands, and submandibular glands (two of the major salivary glands). In some cases, it also affects other glands or organs. The condition is usually painless, mainly causing mouth and eye dryness, and swelling over the affected glands. When other organs are affected, it can be accompanied by complications such as autoimmune pancreatitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and tubulointerstitial nephritis. The underlying cause of IgG4-related disease is still not known."
"Summary of Mitochondrial genetic disorders: Mitochondrial genetic disorders refer to a group of conditions that affect the mitochondria (the structures in each cell of the body that are responsible for making energy). People with these conditions can present at any age with almost any affected body system; however, the brain, muscles, heart, liver, nerves, eyes, ears and kidneys are the organs and tissues most commonly affected. Symptom severity can also vary widely. Mitochondrial genetic disorders can be caused by changes in either the mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA that lead to dysfunction of the mitochondria and inadequate production of energy. Those caused by genetic changes in mitochondrial DNA are transmitted by maternal inheritance, while those caused by genetic changes in nuclear DNA may follow an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Mixed connective tissue disease: Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a rare autoimmune disorder that is characterized by features commonly seen in three different connective tissue disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis. Some affected people may also have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Signs and symptoms vary but may include Raynaud's phenomenon; arthritis; heart, lung and skin abnormalities; kidney disease; muscle weakness, and dysfunction of the esophagus. The cause of MCTD is currently unknown."
Summary of Mondor disease: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Mononeuritis multiplex: A painful asymmetric asynchronous sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy involving isolated damage to at least 2 separate nerve areas; associated with (but not limited to) systemic disorders such as diabetes, vasculitis, amyloidosis, direct tumor involvement, polyarteritis nodosa, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and paraneoplastic syndromes. It also may be associated with Lyme disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sjogren syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, hypereosinophilia, temporal arteritis, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, leprosy, acute viral hepatitis A, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
"Summary of Localized scleroderma: Localized scleroderma is characterized by thickening of the skin from excessive collagen deposits. Collagen is a protein normally present in our skin that provides structural support. However, when too much collagen is made, the skin becomes stiff and hard. Localized types of scleroderma are those limited to the skin and related tissues and, in some cases, the muscle below. Internal organs are not affected by Localized scleroderma, and Localized scleroderma can never progress to the systemic form of the disease. Often, localized conditions improve or go away on their own over time, but the skin changes and damage that occur when the disease is active can be permanent. For some people, Localized scleroderma is serious and disabling. There are two generally recognized types of Localized scleroderma: morphea and linear."
Summary of Chromosome 16 trisomy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Moyamoya disease: Moyamoya disease is a rare, progressive, blood vessel disease caused by blocked arteries at the base of the brain in an area called the basal ganglia. The name ""moyamoya"" means ""puff of smoke"" in Japanese and describes the look of the tangled vessels that form to compensate for the blockage. This condition usually affects children, but can affect adults. Affected people are at increased risk for blood clots, strokes, and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) which are frequently accompanied by seizures and muscular weakness, or paralysis on one side of the body. Affected people may also have disturbed consciousness, speech deficits (usually aphasia), sensory and cognitive impairments, involuntary movements, and vision problems. Moyamoya syndrome is a related term that refers to cases of Moyamoya disease that occur in association with other conditions or risk factors, such as neurofibromatosis, tuberculosis meningitis, sickle cell disease, leptospirosis, brain tumors, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis."
"Summary of Mucopolysaccharidosis: Mucopolysaccharidosis refers to a group of inherited conditions in which the body is unable to properly breakdown mucopolysaccharides (long chains of sugar molecules that are found throughout the body). As a result, these sugars buildup in cells, blood and connective tissue which can lead to a variety of health problems. Associated signs and symptoms and the severity of the condition vary significantly by form. In general, most affected people appear healthy at birth and experience a period of normal development, followed by a decline in physical and/or mental function. As the condition progresses, it may affect appearance; physical abilities; organ and system functioning; and, in most cases, cognitive development. The underlying genetic cause varies by form. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, although one specific form (Type II) follows an X-linked pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Sanfilippo syndrome type A: Sanfilippo syndrome type A is a severe, progressive disorder that affects the central nervous system. In people with Sanfilippo syndrome type A, the body cannot break down a large sugar molecule called heparin sulfate. Signs and symptoms usually begin in early childhood and include severe neurological symptoms such as progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, deafness, loss of vision, and an inability to sleep for more than a few hours at a time. Sanfilippo syndrome type A is caused by genetic changes in the SGSH gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Sanfilippo syndrome type B: Sanfilippo syndrome type B is an genetic disorder that makes the body unable to break down large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs, formerly called mucopolysaccharides). Specifically, people with this condition are unable to break down a GAG called heparan sulfate. Affected individuals can have severe neurological symptoms, including progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, deafness, loss of vision, and an inability to sleep for more than a few hours at a time. Sanfilippo syndrome type B is caused by alterations in the NAGLU gene. This gene provides the instructions for producing an enzyme called N-alpha-acetylglucosaminidase, which is needed to completely break down heparan sulfate. Sanfilippo syndrome type B is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Sanfilippo syndrome type C: Sanfilippo syndrome type C is an genetic disorder that makes the body unable to break down large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs, formerly called mucopolysaccharides). Specifically, people with this condition are unable to break down a GAG called heparan sulfate. Affected individuals can have severe neurological symptoms, including progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, deafness, loss of vision, and an inability to sleep for more than a few hours at a time. Sanfilippo syndrome type C results from the missing or altered enzyme acetyl-CoAlpha-glucosaminide acetyltransferase. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Sanfilippo syndrome type D: Sanfilippo syndrome type D is an genetic disorder that makes the body unable to break down large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs, formerly called mucopolysaccharides). Specifically, people with this condition are unable to break down a GAG called heparan sulfate. Affected individuals can have severe neurological symptoms, including progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, deafness, loss of vision, and an inability to sleep for more than a few hours at a time. Sanfilippo syndrome type D is caused by the missing or deficient enzyme N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase. Sanfilippo syndrome type D is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Multiple system atrophy: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) causes the progressive loss of nerve cells in the brain (a neurodegenerative disease). MSA affects several areas of the brain, including the cerebellum, which is involved in controlling movement and some emotions, as well as certain types of learning and memory, and the autonomic nervous system, which controls your body's automatic, or regulating functions, such as blood pressure, digestion and temperature.The initial symptoms of MSA start around age 50, and are very similar to the initial symptoms of Parkinson's disease. These symptoms may include slowness of movement, tremor, or rigidity (stiffness), clumsiness or coordination problems, difficulties with speech, orthostatic hypotension (a condition in which blood pressure drops when rising from a seated or lying down position), and bladder control problems. Other symptoms of MSA may include muscle contractures, abnormal posture, bending of the neck, involuntary sighing, trouble sleeping and emotional problems. As MSA progresses, breathing problems while sleeping (sleep apnea) and irregular heart rhythms may develop. the parkinsonian type (MSA-P), which have Parkinson disease-like symptoms, such as moving slowly, stiffness, and tremor, along with problems of balance, coordination, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction   the cerebellar type (MSA-C), with primary symptoms of cerebellar ataxia (cerebellum is the part of the brain that is responsible for movement coordination) such as problems with balance and coordination, difficulty swallowing and speaking, and abnormal eye movements   The cause of MSA is unknown, although environmental toxins, trauma, and genetic factors may be involved. Most cases occur at random, without any other cases in the family. Diagnosis of MSA is suggested by a combination of symptoms, physical examination, lab test results, and response to certain medications. However, no laboratory or imaging studies are able to confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Mucopolysaccharidosis type 6: Mucopolysaccharidosis type 6 (MPS 6) is a lysosomal storage disease with progressive multisystem involvement, associated with a deficiency of arylsulfatase B (ASB) leading to the accumulation of dermatan sulfate."

"Summary of Muenke syndrome: Muenke Syndrome is a condition characterized by the premature closure of the coronal suture of the skull (coronal craniosynostosis) during development. This affects the shape of the head and face. Other variable features include abnormalities of the hands or feet, hearing loss and developmental delay. Muenke Syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the FGFR3 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
Summary of Müllerian aplasia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis: Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is a disease that is characterized by the presence of papules and nodules and associated with arthritis mutilans. The disease can involve the skin, the bones, the tendons, the muscles, the joints, and nearly any other organ (e.g., eyes, larynx, thyroid, salivary glands, bone marrow, heart, lung, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract). In the majority of cases, the cause of Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is unknown; however, it has been associated with an underlying cancer in about one fourth of cases, suggesting that it may be a paraneoplastic syndrome."
"Summary of Multiple myeloma: Multiple myeloma is a form of cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled growth of plasma cells in the bone marrow. When present, the most common symptom is anemia, which can be associated with fatigue and shortness of breath. Other features of the condition may include multiple infections; abnormal bleeding; bone pain; weak and/or easily broken bones; and numbness and/or weakness of the arms and legs. The exact underlying cause of Multiple myeloma is currently unknown. Factors that are associated with an increased risk of developing Multiple myeloma include increasing age, male sex, African American race, radiation exposure, a family history of the condition, obesity, and/or a personal history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)."
"Summary of Autosomal recessive multiple pterygium syndrome: Multiple pterygium syndrome, Escobar type is characterized by webbing of skin (pterygium) and a lack of muscle movement (akinesia) that occur before birth. The pterygium typically affect the neck, fingers, elbows, and/or knees. Individuals with multiple pterygium syndrome, Escobar type may also develop a restriction of the joints, known as arthrogryposis, a sideways curve of the spine (scoliosis), and distinctive facial features. Males with this condition can have undescended testes (cryptorchidism). Genetic changes in the CHRNG gene cause most cases of this disorder. It tends to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."

Common symptoms include weakness of the muscles that control the eye and eyelid, facial expressions, chewing, talking, and swallowing. Weakness tends to increase during periods of activity and improve after periods of rest. The condition results from a defect in the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, which is due to the presence of antibodies against acetylcholine. The exact reason this occurs is not known. Some cases have been linked to tumors in the thymus gland. Some cases may go into remission temporarily, and muscle weakness may disappear so that medications can be discontinued."
Summary of Mycobacterium Avium Complex infections: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Mycoplasmal pneumonia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Myelitis: An inflammatory process affecting the spinal cord. Causes include viral infections, autoimmune disorders, vascular disorders, and toxic agents. Symptoms include weakness, paresthesia, sensory loss, pain, and incontinence."
"Summary of Myelodysplastic syndrome: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of blood disorders characterized by abnormal development of blood cells within the bone marrow. People with MDS have abnormally low blood cell levels (low blood counts). Signs and symptoms may include dizziness, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, bruising and bleeding, frequent infections, and headaches. In some people with MDS, the condition progresses to bone marrow failure or develops into acute leukemia. MDS develops when a cell with a genetic change replicates, and the resulting copies begin to predominate in the bone marrow and suppress healthy stem cells. The genetic change may result from a genetic predisposition, or from injury to the DNA caused by an exposure such as chemotherapy or radiation. In many people with MDS there is no obvious exposure or cause."
"Summary of Myocarditis: Myocarditis is a condition that is characterized by inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium). Some affected people have no noticeable symptoms of the condition. When present, signs and symptoms may include chest pain, abnormal heartbeat, shortness of breath, fatigue, signs of infection (i.e. fever, headache, sore throat, diarrhea), and leg swelling. Myocarditis can be caused by a variety of factors including infections (viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal), allergic reactions to certain medications, and exposure to certain chemicals. It can also be associated with other inflammatory conditions such as lupus, Wegener's granulomatosis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."
Summary of Myoclonus-dystonia syndrome: Myoclonus-dystonia syndrome (MDS) is a rare movement disorder characterized by mild to moderate dystonia along with 'lightning-like' myoclonic jerks.
"Summary of Progressive myoclonic epilepsy: Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) refers to a group of inherited conditions involving the central nervous system and representing more than a dozen different diseases. These diseases share certain features, including a worsening of symptoms over time and the presence of both muscle contractions (myoclonus) and seizures (epilepsy). PME is different from myoclonic epilepsy. Other features include dementia, dystonia, and trouble walking or speaking. These rare disorders often get worse over time. Many of these PME diseases begin in childhood or adolescence."
"Summary of Myoclonus epilepsy: A clinically diverse group of epilepsy syndromes characterized either by myoclonic seizures or by myoclonus in association with other seizure types. Myoclonic epilepsy syndromes are divided into three subtypes based on etiology: familial, cryptogenic, and symptomatic."
Summary of Myoclonus epilepsy partial seizure: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of MERRF: Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) is a multisystem disorder characterized by myoclonus, which is often the first symptom, followed by generalized epilepsy, ataxia, weakness, and dementia. Symptoms usually first appear in childhood or adolescence after normal early development. The features of MERRF vary widely from individual to individual, even within families. Other common findings include hearing loss, short stature, optic atrophy, and cardiomyopathy with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The diagnosis is based on clinical features and a muscle biopsy finding of ragged red fibers (RRF). In over 80% of cases, MERRF is caused by genetic changes in the mitochondrial gene called MT-TK. Several other mitochondrial genes have also been reported to cause MERRF, but many of the individuals with genetic changes in these other genes have additional signs and symptoms. Coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine are often used with the hope of improving mitochondrial function."
"Summary of Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor: An Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is an uncommon, usually benign (non-cancerous) tumor made up of cells called myofibroblastic spindle cells. It usually develops in children or young adults, but can affect people of any age. An IMT can occur in almost any part of the body but is most commonly found in the lung, orbit (eye socket), peritoneum (lining of the abdominal cavity and internal organs), and mesentery. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the site of the tumor. Some people with an IMT are asymptomatic, while others may have nonspecific respiratory symptoms, fever, or pain. IMTs may recur, and become locally invasive and/or spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. However, malignant (cancerous) IMTs are rare. The underlying cause of IMTs is poorly understood. Some cases have been linked to translocations involving the ALK gene."
"Summary of Hyaline body myopathy: Hyaline body myopathy (Myosin storage myopathy) is an inherited condition that affects the muscles. Signs and symptoms generally begin during infancy or early childhood; however, some affected people may not develop symptoms until early adulthood and there are even reports of people who are asymptomatic into their 40s. As a result, affected people may experience delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking), trouble climbing stairs, difficulty lifting arms above shoulder level, and less commonly, breathing problems. Hyaline body myopathy is caused by changes in the MYH7 gene and is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency: Hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency is type of metabolic disorder that affects the processing of proteins and removal of ammonia from the body. When proteins are processed by the body, ammonia is formed. Individuals with Hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency are not able to remove ammonia from the body and have symptoms due to toxic levels of ammonia that build up in the blood. Hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency and other similar disorders are a type of metabolic condition known as a urea cycle disorder. Signs and symptoms in newborns with Hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency may include a lack of energy, unwillingness to eat, seizures, unusual body movements, and poorly controlled breathing or body temperature. Complications may include coma, developmental delay, and learning disability. Some people have a less severe form of the deficiency with earliest symptoms manifesting later in life, particularly following high-protein meals, illness, or other stress. Signs and symptoms may include sudden vomiting, lack of coordination, confusion, and coma. Hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the NAGS gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Nail-patella syndrome: Nail-patella syndrome causes changes in the nails, elbows, kneecaps (patellae), and hip bone. The most common symptom of the syndrome is having missing or underdeveloped fingernails and toenails. Other symptoms may include having small or missing kneecaps, underdeveloped elbows, and an extra small piece of bone on both sides of the hip (called iliac horns). People with Nail-patella syndrome are at an increased risk for developing high fluid pressure in the eye (glaucoma) and kidney disease. Nail-patella syndrome is caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants) in the LMX1B gene. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Diagnosis is usually suspected when a person has symptoms of the syndrome. The diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Nance-Horan syndrome: Nance-Horan syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that may be evident at birth. It is characterized by teeth abnormalities and cataracts, resulting in poor vision. Additional eye abnormalities are also often present, including a very small cornea and nystagmus. In some cases, the condition may also be associated with physical abnormalities and/or intellectual disability. The range and severity of symptoms may vary greatly from one person to another, even among affected members of the same family. Nance-Horan syndrome is caused by a genetic change in the NHS gene and is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait, which means that both males and females can be affected, but males often have more severe symptoms."
Summary of Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a tumor arising from the epithelial cells that cover the surface and line the nasopharynx.
"Summary of Gorlin syndrome: Gorlin syndrome leads to the growth of non-cancerous and cancerous tumors. The symptoms include basal cell cancers, jaw cysts, skin pits on the hands and feet, and abnormal deposits of calcium in the brain. Other symptoms may include bone abnormalities of the spine, ribs, or skull, and a large head. Some of the signs and symptoms of Gorlin syndrome are present at birth. There is an increased risk for a type of brain tumor (medulloblastoma) in childhood. Jaw cysts and basal cell cancers typically appear by adulthood. Gorlin syndrome occurs when the PTCH1, PTCH2, or the SUFU gene is not working correctly. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Gorlin syndrome is diagnosed based on clinical examination for specific features and genetic testing."
Summary of Neisseria meningitidis infection: Infections with bacteria of the species NEISSERIA MENINGITIDIS.
"Summary of Nelson syndrome: A rare, acquired, endocrine disease characterized by the triad of diffuse skin and mucosa hyperpigmentation, markedly elevated serum adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) levels and an enlarging corticotroph adenoma, which manifest following total bilateral adrenalectomy performed for the treatment of Cushing's disease. Additionally, patients may present with headaches, visual field defects, cranial nerve palsy, pituitary apoplexy, diabetes inspidus, panhypopituitarism, and, occasionally, paraovarian or paratesticular tumors."
"Summary of Childhood-onset nemaline myopathy: Childhood onset nemaline myopathy, or mild nemaline myopathy is a type of nemaline myopathy (NM; see this terms) characterized by distal muscle weakness, and sometimes slowness of muscle contraction."
"Summary of Neonatal hemochromatosis: Neonatal hemochromatosis is a disease in which too much iron builds up in the body. This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. In this form of hemochromatosis, the iron overload begins before birth. This disease tends to progress rapidly and is characterized by liver damage that is apparent at birth or in the first days of life. Babies with the disease may be born very early (premature) or struggle to grow in the womb (intrauterine growth restriction). Symptoms of Neonatal hemochromatosis may include low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), abnormalities in blood clotting, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), and swelling (edema). The exact cause of Neonatal hemochromatosis is unknown. It is thought that the disease may be caused by a pregnant woman's immune system recognizing cells of the baby's liver as foreign. If a woman had a baby with Neonatal hemochromatosis, each future child has an 80% chance to have the disease as well. A diagnosis of Neonatal hemochromatosis is suspected when a doctor observes signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis or liver disease in a newborn. A doctor may decide to order laboratory tests including a liver biopsy, MRI, or blood test."
Summary of Neonatal herpes: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Nephrocalcinosis: Nephrocalcinosis is a disorder that occurs when too much calcium is deposited in the kidneys. It commonly occurs in premature infants. Individuals may not have symptoms or may have symptoms related to the condition causing Nephrocalcinosis. If kidney stones are present, symptoms may include blood in the urine, fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, and severe pain in the belly area, sides of the back (flank), groin, or testicles. Later symptoms may be associated with chronic kidney failure. It may be caused by use of certain medications or supplements, infection, or any condition that leads to high levels of calcium in the blood or urine including hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, Alport syndrome, Bartter syndrome, and a variety of other conditions. Some of the underlying disorders that can cause Nephrocalcinosis are genetic, with the inheritance pattern depending on the specific disorder."
"Summary of Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a disorder in which a defect in the small tubes (tubules) in the kidneys causes a person to produce a large amount of urine. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidney tubules, which allow water to be removed from the body or reabsorbed, do not respond to a chemical in the body called antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin. ADH normally tells the kidneys to make the urine more concentrated. As a result of the defect, the kidneys release an excessive amount of water into the urine, producing a large quantity of very dilute urine. The most common symptoms are frequent urination (polyuria), especially during nighttime (nocturia), and drinking too much liquids (polydipsia). It can be either acquired or hereditary. The acquired form is brought on by certain drugs and chronic diseases and can occur at any time during life. About 90% of all cases of hereditary Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus result from genetic changes in the AVPR2 gene, and about 10% of cases are caused by genetic changes in the AQP2 gene."
"Summary of Nephrosclerosis: Hardening of the KIDNEY due to infiltration by fibrous connective tissue (FIBROSIS), usually caused by renovascular diseases or chronic HYPERTENSION. Nephrosclerosis leads to renal ISCHEMIA."
"Summary of Netherton syndrome: Netherton disease is a rare disorder affecting the skin, hair and immune system. Symptoms are present at birth and include red, scaly skin. Other symptoms include outbreaks of red, circular scaly rashes, thin, fragile hair (bamboo hair), and immune reactions such as hay fever, asthma, itchy skin, and eczema. Dehydration and infection are common and can be serious. Babies tend to grow slowly and have poor weight gain. Netherton syndrome is caused by the SPINK5 gene not working correctly. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Netherton syndrome is diagnosed based on clinical examination, the symptoms, and genetic testing."
"Summary of Sialidosis type 2: Sialidosis is a severe inherited disorder that affects many organs and tissues, including the nervous system. Sialidosis type II, the more severe type of the disorder, is further divided into congenital, infantile, and juvenile forms. This type of sialidosis often begins during infancy or later during childhood and is characterized by cherry-red macules, mildly coarse facial features, skeletal malformations and mild cognitive impairment. Sialidosis type II is caused by genetic changes in the NEU1 gene. People with sialidosis type II have genetic changes that severely reduce or eliminate NEU1 enzyme activity. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Neuroblastoma: Neuroblastoma is a tumor that develops from neuroblasts (immature nerve tissue) in an infant or child, usually before the age of 5. It most often develops in infancy and may be diagnosed in the first month of life. The tumor most often develops in the adrenal gland, but may develop in the neck, chest, or spinal cord. It is considered an aggressive tumor because it often spreads to other parts of the body (metastasizes). In most cases, it has spread by the time it is diagnosed. A Neuroblastoma can cause a variety of signs and symptoms, including a lump where the tumor is growing, bone pain, diarrhea, and various neurological symptoms. The cause of most Neuroblastomas is not known. Rarely, a Neuroblastoma is caused by an inherited genetic change in a gene, such as the ALK gene or PHOX2B gene. Diagnosing a Neuroblastoma may rely on a physical examination, blood tests, imaging tests (such as MRI or CT scan) and ultimately, a biopsy."
"Summary of Neurocutaneous melanocytosis: Neurocutaneous melanosis (NCM) is a rare, non-inherited condition of the central nervous system. It is characterized by melanocytic nevi in both the skin and the brain. Two-thirds of people with NCM have giant congenital melanocytic nevi, and the remaining one-third have numerous lesions but no giant lesions. The typical cutaneous lesions are present at birth. Neurological features typically present in the first or second year. Intracranial hypertension is the most common presentation, along with seizures, decreased alertness, and cranial nerve dysfunction.The underlying cause, while not completely understood, is believed to be a primary defect in the neural crest."
Summary of Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Alzheimer disease 15: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Neurofibroma: A Neurofibroma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumor that develops from the cells and tissues that cover nerves. Some people who develop Neurofibromas have a genetic condition known as neurofibromatosis (NF). There are different types of NF, but type 1 is the most common."
"Summary of Neurofibromatosis type 2: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors of the nervous system. Childhood symptoms include skin growths and eye findings. Almost all people with NF2 develop vestibular schwannomas affecting both ears. Other tumors of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), skin and eye are also common. The signs and symptoms vary from person to person. The severity depends on the size, location, and number of tumors. NF2 is caused by changes in the NF2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. It is diagnosed based on a clinical examination and the symptoms. Genetic testing may be helpful."
"Summary of Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare neurological condition that is caused by an adverse reaction to neuroleptic (tranquilizer) or antipsychotic drugs. These drugs are commonly prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia and other neurological, mental, or emotional disorders. Affected people may experience high fever, muscle stiffness, sweating, unstable blood pressure, altered mental status, and autonomic dysfunction. In most cases, the condition develops within the first 2 weeks of treatment with the drug; however, it may develop any time during the therapy period. The exact underlying cause of Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is unknown. In some cases, more than one family member can be affected which suggests there may be a genetic component."
Summary of Neuroma biliary tract: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Neuronal interstitial dysplasia: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Neurotoxicity syndromes: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Thymic aplasia: A rare primary immunodeficiency with autosomal or X-linked recessive inheritance, characterized by atrophy of the thymus in the absence of other congenital abnormalities, with profound T-cell deficiency, while serum immunoglobulin levels are normal or increased. Patients present with chronic or recurrent infections in infancy including candidiasis, skin, pulmonary and urinary tract infections, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive."
"Summary of Infantile neurovisceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency: Infantile neurovisceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency is an inherited condition involving lipid metabolism, which is the breakdown, transport, and use of fats and cholesterol in the body. In people with this condition, abnormal lipid metabolism causes harmful amounts of lipids to accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and brain. Infantile neurovisceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency appears during infancy and is characterized by an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), and progressive deterioration of the nervous system. Due to the involvement of the nervous system, Infantile neurovisceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency is also known as the neurological type. Infantile neurovisceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the SMPD1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Niemann-Pick disease type C: A rare lysosomal lipid storage disease characterized by variable clinical signs, depending on the age of onset, such as prolonged unexplained neonatal jaundice or cholestasis, isolated unexplained splenomegaly, and progressive, often severe neurological symptoms such as cognitive decline, cerebellar ataxia, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (VSPG), dysarthria, dysphagia, dystonia, seizures, gelastic cataplexy, and psychiatric disorders."
"Summary of Nocardiosis: Nocardiosis is a rare infectious disorder, that affects the brain, skin, and/or lungs. It occurs mainly in people with a weakened immune system but can affect anyone, and about one-third of infected people do not have any immune problems.. This condition usually starts in the lungs and can spread to other body organs. Affected individuals usually experience problems with their lungs (chest pain, coughing up blood, fevers), brain (headaches and seizures), and skin (skin infections, ulcers, and abscesses). Nocardiosis is caused by a bacteria of the family (genus) known as Nocardia which have different species (types). Nocardia bacteria are able to cause localized or systemic disease in humans and animals. The nocardia bacteria are found in soil around the world. People contract this disease by either inhaling contaminated dust or if soil containing nocardia bacteria get into an open wound."
Summary of Non-lissencephalic cortical dysplasia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Glycine encephalopathy: Glycine encephalopathy is an inherited metabolic disease characterized by abnormally high levels of an amino acid called glycine. Glycine is a chemical messenger that transmits signals in the brain. According to the symptoms the disease onset, Glycine encephalopathy may be divided in 4 forms.  Classical neonatal form (most common): Symptoms start within a few days of life and may include poor feeding, lack of energy (lethargy), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), hiccups, breathing problems, seizures, hiccups, and coma. Transient form: Symptoms are similar to the classic form, but glycine levels decrease and the symptoms may improve within time. Glycine encephalopathy is caused by changes in the AMT, GLDC or GCSH genes which result in a deficiency of the enzyme that break-up the glycine. Diagnosis is based in the symptoms, the high glycine levels and the enzyme deficiency, as well as genetic testing. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Milroy disease: Milroy disease affects the lymphatic system and can lead to swelling (lymphedema) of the legs and feet. Prior to birth, symptoms of Milroy disease may include fluid buildup in the legs and feet and sometimes, within the body (nonimmune hydrops). After birth, symptoms may include swelling of the lower limbs, a buildup of fluid in the scrotum (hydrocele), and skin changes. People with Milroy disease have an increased risk for developing skin infections and certain types of cancer. Milroy disease occurs when the FLT4 gene is not working correctly. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The diagnosis of Milroy disease is made based on the symptoms, a clinical exam and other types of testing. The diagnosis may be confirmed by genetic testing."
Summary of Nonsyndromic hereditary sensorineural hearing loss: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Norrie disease: Norrie disease is an inherited eye disorder that leads to blindness in male infants at birth or soon after birth. Additional symptoms may occur in some cases, although this varies even among individuals in the same family. Most affected individuals develop sensorineural hearing loss and many exhibit cognitive abnormalities such as developmental delays, behavioral issues, or psychotic-like features. Norrie disease is caused by genetic changes in the NDP gene. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern."
Summary of Notalgia paresthetica: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: Lesch Nyhan syndrome is a condition characterized by neurological and behavioral abnormalities and the overproduction of uric acid in the body. It occurs almost exclusively in males. Signs and symptoms may include inflammatory arthritis (gout), kidney stones, bladder stones, and moderate cognitive disability. Nervous system and behavioral disturbances also occur, such as involuntary muscle movements and self injury (including biting and head banging). People with Lesch Nyhan syndrome usually cannot walk, require assistance sitting, and generally use a wheelchair. Lesch Nyhan syndrome is caused by changes in the HPRT1 gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner."
Summary of Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Ochronosis: Ochronosis is the bluish-black or grey-blue discoloration of the skin, especially the ear cartilage, the ocular (eye) tissue, and other body locations. It can occurs in individuals with alkaptonuria, an inherited metabolic disorder; or because of exposure to various substances. Ochronosis associated with alkaptonuria is caused by a genetic change in the HGD gene, which results in the accumulation and deposition of homogentisic acid (HGA) in cartilage. The affected tissue becomes weak and brittle with time, leading to chronic inflammation, joint pain, and osteoarthritis. Alkaptonuria is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Alkaptonuria can be diagnosed based on the symptoms, laboratory testing, and genetic testing. When Ochronosis is due to exposure to substances (called exogenous Ochronosis), the condition is not inherited. Exogenous Ochronosis is associated with malarial drugs, skin-lightening creams and over-exposure to the sun. Other than the skin findings, there are no other health affects. Exogenous Ochronosis may be hard to diagnose."
"Summary of Ocular melanoma: Ocular melanoma (OM) is a cancer in pigment-producing cells of the eye called melanocytes. Melanocytes are cells that produce the pigment melanin that colors the skin, hair, and eyes, as well as forms moles. There are four tissues in the eye in which melanoma can develop: the uveal tract (uvea); conjunctiva; eyelid; and orbit. The uvea - the middle layer within the eye - is divided into three main parts: the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveal melanoma, also called intraOcular melanoma, is the most common Ocular melanoma. Conjunctival melanoma manifests on the surface of the eye and has been increasing in incidence. Eyelid and primary orbital melanoma are the least common variants."
"Summary of Ocular toxoplasmosis: Ocular toxoplasmosis is an infection in the eye caused by the parasite, Toxoplasm a gondii. Toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of eye inflammation in the world. Toxoplamosis can be acquired or present at birth (congenital), having crossed the placenta from a newly infected mother to her fetus. Most humans acquire toxoplasmosis by eating raw or undercooked meat, vegetables or milk products, or by coming into contact with infected cat litterbox or sandboxes. In individuals with compromised immune systems, Toxoplasm a gondii can reactivate to cause disease. Reactivation of a congenital infection was traditionally thought to be the most common cause of Ocular toxoplasmosis, but an acquired infection is now considered to be more common. A toxoplasmosis infection that affects the eye usually attacks the retina and initially resolves without symptoms. However, the inactive parasite may later reactivate causing eye pain, blurred vision, and possibly permanent damage, including blindness."
"Summary of Oculodentodigital dysplasia: Oculodentodigital dysplasia is a condition that affects many parts of the body, including the eyes (oculo-), teeth (dento-), and fingers (digital). Symptoms of the condition include having small eyes, vision loss, missing teeth, frequent cavities, and bony growths in the fingers. The condition is caused by a genetic change in GJA1 and is most typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Oculodentodigital dysplasia can be diagnosed by a clinical examination and confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by slowly progressing muscle disease (myopathy) affecting the muscles of the upper eyelids and the throat. Symptoms may include: eyelid drooping (ptosis), arm and leg weakness, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). There are two types of OPMD, distinguished by their patterns of inheritance. They are known as the autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive types."
Summary of Odontoma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Ogilvie syndrome: Ogilvie syndrome is a rare condition that affects the large intestines (colon). Although the signs and symptoms mimic those of an intestinal blockage, there is no physical obstruction. Instead, the symptoms are due to nerve or muscle problems that affect peristalsis (the involuntary, rhythmic muscular contractions that move food, fluid, and air through the intestines). In people affected by Ogilvie syndrome, the symptoms come on suddenly and may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention (swelling), constipation, and/or diarrhea. The underlying cause of Ogilvie syndrome is poorly understood. However, it usually occurs in adults when the colon becomes enlarged after surgery, illness or injury."
"Summary of Olivopontocerebellar atrophy: Olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) is a term used for a progressive condition characterized by the degeneration of nerve cells (neurons) in specific areas of the brain. OPCA can be viewed as a finding of several diseases, and indicates a form of progressive ataxia (abnormal or uncontrolled movements) distinguished by characteristic findings in brain imaging studies and at autopsy (pontine flattening and cerebellar atrophy). It was traditionally divided in hereditary or genetic OPCA and sporadic OPCA. Currently, most of the major forms of hereditary OPCA refer to disorders that overlap with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), which is a neurological disorder characterized by ataxia. The sporadic forms are considered now to be a form of multiple system atrophy (MSA). OPCA may also occur in people with prion disorders and inherited metabolic diseases. The main symptom is clumsiness that slowly gets worse. Other symptoms may include problems with balance; speech or swallowing problems; difficulty walking; abnormal eye movements; muscle spasms; and neuropathy. Whether OPCA is inherited (and the inheritance pattern) depends on the underlying cause, if known."
"Summary of Ollier disease: Ollier disease is a skeletal disorder characterized by multiple enchondromas, which are noncancerous (benign) growths of cartilage that develop within the bones. These growths may lead to skeletal deformities, limb discrepancy, and fractures. The enchondromas primarily occur in the limb bones, especially the bones of the hands and feet. They tend to develop near the ends of the bones, where growth occurs. Symptoms often appear in the first decade of life. The underlying cause of Ollier disease is not fully understood. In many people, the condition can be attributed to somatic genetic changes in the IDH1 or IDH2 gene. The disease is not typically inherited."
"Summary of Onchocerciasis: Onchocerciasis is a rare tropical parasitic disease transmitted by a black fly. Infection by the parasite can cause eye and skin problems. In humans, the parasitic worms live under the skin (subcutaneous nodules) and produce larvae (microfilariae). The larvae are found throughout the body, but especially in the skin and eyes. Repeated bites by infected flies increase the number of adult worms and larvae. Chronic skin Onchocerciasis (onchodermatitis) causes itching, a rash with small pimples (papular rash), scarring, and thickened, leathery skin (lichenification). Other symptoms may develop over time and might include saggy skin (such as ''hanging groin''), patchy areas of much lighter colored skin (leopard skin), ichthyosis-like lesions (''lizard skin''), darkening of the skin, and very severe itching. The eye infection is known as river blindness because the blackfly carrying the parasite lives near fast-flowing waters. Symptoms of an eye infection may include itchy eyes, red eyes, and sensitivity to light (photophobia). In some cases, the larvae may infect the optic nerve. As the common name suggests, infection of the eye by Onchocerciasis can lead to vision loss and eventually blindness. The disease is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus and is transmitted by the bite of an infected black fly. About 90% of the cases occur in Africa."
"Summary of Oral leukoplakia: Oral leukoplakia describes a white plaque that does not rub off and cannot be characterized as any other condition. Though it may occur in any part of the mouth, it generally affects the tongue, gums, and inner cheek. Physicians will usually biopsy Oral leukoplakia lesions as 20-40% of cases are precancerous or cancerous at the time of biopsy and another 8-15% become cancerous over time. The exact cause of Oral leukoplakia is not known."
Summary of Oral lichen planus: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Oral squamous cell carcinoma: A squamous cell carcinoma arising from the oral cavity. It affects predominantly adults in their fifth and sixth decades of life and is associated with alcohol and tobacco use. Human papillomavirus is present in approximately half of the cases. It is characterized by a tendency to metastasize early to the lymph nodes. When the tumor is small, patients are often asymptomatic. Physical examination may reveal erythematous or white lesions or plaques. The majority of patients present with signs and symptoms of locally advanced disease including mucosal ulceration, pain, difficulty with speaking, chewing, and swallowing, bleeding, weight loss, and neck swelling. Patients may also present with swollen neck lymph nodes without any symptoms from the oropharyngeal tumor. The most significant prognostic factors are the size of the tumor and the lymph nodes status."
"Summary of Oral submucous fibrosis: Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a chronic, progressive disease that alters the fibroelasticity of the oral submucosa, prevalent in India and Southeast Asia but rare elsewhere, and characterized by burning and pain in the oral cavity, loss of gustatory sensation, the presence of blanched fibrous bands and stiffening of the oral mucosa and oro-pharynx (leading to trismus and a progressive reduction in mouth opening) and an increased risk of developing oral squamous cell cancer (3-19%). It is usually associated with the chewing of the areca nut (an ingredient in betel quid) but the exact etiology is unknown and there is currently no effective treatment."
"Summary of Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 deficiency: Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency (CPS1 deficiency) is a genetic disorder that causes episodes of toxic levels of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). Symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, lack of energy, low body temperature and weak muscle tone. These usually occur in the first few days of life. High levels of ammonia can lead to complications such as seizures, breathing problems, intellectual disability and coma. CPS1 deficiency is caused by alterations in the CPS1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, laboratory testing, and genetic testing."
Summary of Ornithinemia: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Osteochondroma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Osteosarcoma: Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer. Boys and girls have a similar incidence of this tumor until late adolescence, at which time boys are more commonly affected. In rare cases, Osteosarcoma occurs in adults. Although Osteosarcoma tends to occur in the larger bones, such as the shin (near the knee), thigh (near the knee) and upper arm (near the shoulder), it can occur in any bone. A number of variants of Osteosarcoma exist, including conventional types (osteoblastic, chondroblastic, and fibroblastic), telangiectatic, multifocal, parosteal, and periosteal. The cause of Osteosarcoma is not known. In some cases, it runs in families, and at least one gene has been linked to increased risk."
"Summary of Osteomalacia: Osteomalacia is a disease that is characterized by a weakening of the bone, often due to a deficiency of vitamin D. This vitamin supports the development of the bones of the body, so when there are low levels of vitamin D, the bones are not strong enough. Symptoms of Osteomalacia can include muscle weakness, bone pain, and walking with a waddling gait. Pain is especially likely to occur in the lower back, hips, and legs. The weakening of the bones may also cause them to easily fracture. Osetomalacia can be caused by having a low level of vitamin D in the diet or lack of sun exposure. The condition may also be the result of an underlying disease such as celiac disease, or kidney or liver disorders. Diagnosis of Osteomalacia is possible through blood or urine tests to check for vitamin D levels or a bone biopsy."
"Summary of Osteomyelitis: Osteomyelitis is the medical term for an infection in a bone. Signs and symptoms vary but may include bone pain, fever, chills, excessive sweating, malaise, or an open wound. People with the condition may also experience local swelling, redness, and warmth at the site of the infection. Although any bone in the body can be affected, the long bones of the arms and legs are most commonly infected in children, while the feet, spine bones, and hips are primarily affected in adults. Osteomyelitis is most often caused by a bacterial infection, although it can also be caused by a fungal infection. Risk factors for the condition include diabetes, poor blood supply, recent injury, intravenous drug abuse, surgery involving the bones, and a weakened immune system."
Summary of Oto-Palatal-digital syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Ovarian cancer: Ovarian cancer is a form of cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in the ovaries. Many people with early Ovarian cancer have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms are often nonspecific and blamed on other, more common conditions. Most cases of Ovarian cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition; however, approximately 10-25% of Ovarian cancers are thought to be ""hereditary."" Although the underlying genetic cause of some hereditary cases is unknown, many are part of a hereditary cancer syndrome (such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 hereditary breast and Ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome) and are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Malignant mixed Müllerian tumor of the ovary: Malignant mixed MÃ¼llerian tumor of the ovary, is a rare, aggressive cancer of the ovary with characteristics of two types of cancer: carcinoma and sarcoma. Because women with this cancer often have no symptoms, more than half of women are diagnosed at an advanced stage. When present, symptoms may include pain in the abdomen or pelvic area, bloating or swelling of the abdomen, quickly feeling full when eating, or other digestive problems. The cause of Ovarian carcinosarcoma is not yet understood."
"Summary of Ovarian remnant syndrome: Ovarian remnant syndrome (ORS) is characterized by the presence of residual ovarian tissue after a woman has had surgery to remove one ovary or both ovaries (oophorectomy). Signs and symptoms may include pelvic pain, a pelvic mass, or the absence of menopause after oophorectomy. The condition may be caused by surgical factors leading to incomplete removal of ovarian tissue, including factors that limit surgical exposure of the ovary or compromise surgical technique. Factors may include pelvic adhesions (limiting ability to see the ovary or causing it to adhere to other tissues); anatomic variations; bleeding during surgery; or poor surgical technique."
Summary of Pachydermoperiostosis: Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare disorder characterized by clubbing of the fingers and toes; thickening of the skin of the face (pachyderma); excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis); and new bone formation associated with joint pain. Other features may include congenital heart disease and delayed closure of fontanelles. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. Genetic changes in the HPGD gene have been found in those with the autosomal recessive form of this condition.
"Summary of Pachygyria: ""Pachygyria is a developmental condition due to abnormal migration of nerve cells (neurons) in the developing brain and nervous system. With Pachygyria, there are few gyri (the ridges between the wrinkles in the brain), and they are usually broad and flat. The condition is also known as """"incomplete lissencephaly."""" Pachygyria may occur alone (isolated) or as part of various underlying syndromes. Symptoms vary among affected people and may include moderate to severe developmental delay, seizures, poor muscle tone and control, feeding or swallowing difficulties, and small head size (microcephaly). In most cases it is not inherited, but various inheritance patterns have been reported."""
"Summary of Paget disease of the nipple: Paget disease of the nipple describes a rare presentation of breast cancer, seen most frequently in women aged 50-60, manifesting with nipple drainage and itching, erythema, crusty and excoriated nipple, thickened plaques, and hyperpigmentation (less frequently). It is due to tumor cells invading the nipple-areola complex and represents 1-3% of all new breast cancer diagnoses."
"Summary of Palindromic rheumatism: ""Palindromic rheumatism (PR) is a type of recurrent arthritis characterized by episodes or """"attacks"""" of joint inflammation, sequentially affecting one to several joint areas for hours to days. A PR attack often occurs suddenly without any obvious triggers or warning symptoms. Any joint(s) may be affected, but finger joints, wrists, and knees are most commonly affected. Symptoms during episodes may include pain, swelling, stiffness, and redness in and around the joints. Some people may have a fever and other systemic symptoms. Between episodes, people with PR have no symptoms. The time between episodes may last from days to months. The underlying cause of PR is not known. Some people with PR eventually develop chronic rheumatic disease, the most common being rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Others may develop lupus and/or other systemic disorders. People with anti-CCP antibodies detected in a blood test appear more likely to develop RA. There has been some evidence to support that PR can be a presenting feature of RA (or part of the spectrum of RA), rather than a distinct condition."""
"Summary of Pallister-Hall syndrome: Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a genetic disease that affects the development of many parts of the body. Common features include extra fingers and/or toes (polydactyly), extra skin between the fingers or toes (syndactyly), an abnormal growth in the brain called a hypothalamic hamartoma, and a malformation of the airway known as bifid epiglottis. The bifid epiglottis in rare cases may lead to respiratory failure. While the hypothalamic hamartoma in most cases does not cause problems, in some cases it may cause neurological problems such as seizures, growth hormone deficiency, precocious puberty, or a deficiency of many hormones (panhypopituitarism) that can result in cortisol deficiency. Other symptoms of PHS may include imperforate anus, abnormalities in the kidneys, heart defects, small genitalia, lack of fingers, nail problems, cleft palate, bifid uvula, and development delay and behavioral problems. Pallister-Hall syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the GLI3 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, however, in about a quarter of cases Pallister-Hall syndrome results from a new (de novo) genetic change. The diagnosis of Pallister-Hall syndrome can be made when there is a hypothalamic hamartoma and polydactyly. The genetic test that identifies a genetic change in the GLI3 gene confirms the diagnosis."
"Summary of PANDAS: Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Streptococcus infections (PANDAS) is a neurological and psychiatric condition in which symptoms are brought on or worsened by a Streptococcal (strep) infection. PANDAS is a subtype of pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). The main neuropsyciatric symptoms are the presence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tics (uncontrolled, sudden, repetitive movements or sounds), which are severe enough to interfere the ability to function. After the initial strep infection, subsequent flares can be associated with other infectious or environmental triggers. The underlying cause of PANDAS is unclear, but studies suggest that a strep infection causes an abnormal immune response resulting in neuropsychiatric symptoms."
Summary of Mesomelic dwarfism of hypoplastic tibia and radius type: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Papilledema: Papilledema is a condition in which increased pressure in or around the brain (intracranial pressure) causes swelling of the part of the optic nerve inside the eye (optic disc). Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure include headache or nausea and vomiting. Vision problems are not common initially, but may include short flickers of gray vision, blurred or double vision, and decreased field of vision or ability to see colors. Both eyes are usually affected. Papilledema by definition is caused by increased cranial pressure. Diagnosis includes a thorough eye exam by an ophthalmologist. Brain imaging studies (for example CT scan or MRI) are used to find the cause of the increased intracranial pressure."
"Summary of Optic neuritis: Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve, the nerve that carries the visual signal from the eye to the brain. The condition may cause sudden, reduced vision in the affected eye(s). While the cause of Optic neuritis is unknown, it has been associated with autoimmune diseases, infections, multiple sclerosis, drug toxicity and deficiency of vitamin B-12."
"Summary of Localized lichen myxedematosus: Localized lichen myxedematosus is a rare skin disorder characterized by deposits of mucin in the skin. The terms ""Papular mucinosis"" and ""lichen myxoedematosus"" are generally used interchangeably to describe the occurrence of this condition as a localized and less severe form, while the term scleromyxoedema refers to a generalized, more severe form. Signs and symptoms of the condition include the presence of small, firm, waxy papules on the skin that are confined to a few sites on the body. Affected individuals are typically otherwise healthy. The cause of the condition is unknown, but it is commonly associated with monoclonal gammopathy. It has also been reported in association with bone marrow cancers as well HIV infection, hepatitis C, exposure to toxic oil and contaminated L-tryptophan. Localized lichen myxedematosus typically does not require therapy, but topical corticosteroids and oral isotretinoin may help to reduce hardening of the skin."
Summary of Papular urticaria: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Paracoccidioidomycosis: A rare mycosis characterized by an acute form mostly occurring in children and young adults presenting with fever, weight loss, lymph node enlargement, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow dysfunction, versus a chronic form which usually involves the lungs and mucosae of the upper respiratory tract, skin, lymph nodes, and adrenal glands, but may affect any part of the body. The most common sequelae are chronic respiratory insufficiency and Addison's disease. The infectious agent, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, is a fungus limited to Latin America."
"Summary of Paragangliomas 1: Paragangliomas are tumors that can occur anywhere in the body and are derived from paraganglia (type of cell). There are two types of paragangliomas: nonchromaffin and chromaffin. Nonchromaffin types are located in the head and neck region and primarily serve as chemoreceptors (receptors that detect chemical concentration changes). Chromaffin types have endocrine activity and are usually located below the head and neck. Paragangliomas can manifest as nonchromaffin head and neck tumors only, adrenal and/or extraadrenal pheochromocytomas only, or a combination of both types of tumors. When gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and extraadrenal paraganglioma are all present, this is refered to as Carney triad (which is different from Carney syndrome of myxoma, spotty pigmentation, and endocrinopathy). There are several genetic heterogeneities of paragangliomas, that are caused by mutations in different genes."
"Summary of Paramyotonia congenita of Von Eulenburg: Paramyotonia congenita of Von Eulenburg is an inherited condition that affects muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), mainly in the face, neck, arms, and hands. Symptoms begin in infancy or early childhood and include episodes of sustained muscle tensing (myotonia) that prevent muscles from relaxing normally and lead to muscle weakness. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the SCN4A gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
"Summary of Paraplegia: Complete paralysis of the lower half of the body including both legs, often caused by damage to the spinal cord."
"Summary of Parapsoriasis: Parapsoriasis describes a group of skin diseases that can be characterized by scaly patches or slightly elevated papules and/or plaques (red, scaly patches) that have a resemblance to psoriasis. Because of the variation in clinical presentation and a lack of a specific diagnostic finding on histopathology, a uniformly accepted definition of Parapsoriasis remains lacking. There are 2 general forms: a small plaque type, which is usually benign, and a large plaque type, which is a precursor of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)."
"Summary of Parathyroid carcinoma: A rare endocrine tumor characterized by a malignant neoplasm derived from parathyroid parenchymal cells, localized in one of the normally located parathyroid glands or other sites where parathyroid tissue may be present. Signs and symptoms are predominantly due to excess secretion of parathyroid hormone, with marked hypercalcemia and renal and bone involvement. In rare cases, the tumor may be non-functioning and only present as a palpable mass in the neck region. Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis is also observed. The tumor can occur sporadically or on a genetic background. The extent of invasion of adjacent structures positively correlates with the development of recurrent or metastatic disease."
"Summary of Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria: Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) is a very rare subtype of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA, see this term), caused by the presence of cold-reacting autoantibodies in the blood and characterized by the sudden presence of hemoglobinuria, typically after exposure to cold temperatures."
"Summary of Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired disorder that leads to the premature death and impaired production of blood cells. It can occur at any age, but is usually diagnosed in young adulthood. People with PNH have recurring episodes of symptoms due to hemolysis, which may be triggered by stresses on the body such as infections or physical exertion. This results in a deficiency of various types of blood cells and can cause signs and symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, abnormally pale skin (pallor), shortness of breath, and an increased heart rate. People with PNH may also be prone to infections and abnormal blood clotting (thrombosis) or hemorrhage, and are at increased risk of developing leukemia. It is caused by acquired, rather than inherited, genetic changes in the PIGA gene; the condition is not passed down to children of affected individuals."
"Summary of Progressive hemifacial atrophy: Progressive hemifacial atrophy (PHA), also known as Parry-Romberg syndrome, is characterized by slowly progressive deterioration of the skin and soft tissues on one side of the face. It sometimes occurs on both sides of the face and occasionally involves the arm, trunk, and/or leg. The condition may worsen for many years and then stabilize. The severity varies greatly. While the cause is not well understood, it may differ among affected people."
"Summary of Pars planitis: Pars planitis is a disease of the eye that is characterized by inflammation of the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. This may lead to blurred vision; dark, floating spots in the vision; and progressive vision loss. As the condition advances, cataracts, retinal detachment, or macular edema (fluid within the retina) may develop. Pars planitis most often affects young men and is generally not associated with any other disease or symptoms (idiopathic); however, it can be associated with other autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis and sarcoidosis."
"Summary of Trisomy 13: Trisomy 13 is a type of chromosome disorder characterized by having 3 copies of chromosome 13 in cells of the body, instead of the usual 2 copies. In some people, only a portion of cells contains the extra chromosome 13 (called mosaic Trisomy 13), whereas other cells contain the normal chromosome pair. Trisomy 13 causes severe intellectual disability and many physical abnormalities, such as congenital heart defects; brain or spinal cord abnormalities; very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia); extra fingers or toes; cleft lip with or without cleft palate; and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Most cases are not inherited and result from a random error during the formation of eggs or sperm in healthy parents. Trisomy 13 is diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and confirmed by the results of a chromosome test."
"Summary of Patent ductus arteriosus 1: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a heart condition that affects some babies from birth. Before a baby is born, there is a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus that helps the baby's blood flow. It moves blood from the lung artery to the aorta, which is the main artery in the body. This helps the baby get the oxygen it needs without using its lungs. After the baby is born and starts breathing, the ductus arteriosus should close so that the blood can flow normally through the lungs and the rest of the body. However, if it remains open, it is called PDA. If it is not treated, it can cause problems with the heart and lungs, like high blood pressure in the lungs and heart failure. PDA can happen to babies who are born too early, and it may go away on its own or with medicine that stops the body from making certain chemicals. The term PDA is usually not considered a genetic disorder, but it can happen again in 5% of siblings of people with PDA. This suggests that there may be a genetic part to how the disease develops, which was previously thought to be caused by many different factors."
"Summary of Pearson syndrome: Pearson syndrome affects many parts of the body but especially the bone marrow and the pancreas. Pearson syndrome affects the cells in the bone marrow (hematopoietic stem cells) that produce red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Having too few red blood cells (anemia), white blood cells (neutropenia), or platelets (thrombocytopenia) can cause a child to feel weak and tired, be sick more often, bruise more easily and take a longer time to stop bleeding when cut. Pearson syndrome also affects the pancreas, which can cause frequent diarrhea and stomach pain, trouble gaining weight, and diabetes. Some children with Person syndrome may also have problems with their liver, kidneys, heart, eyes, ears, and/or brain. Pearson syndrome is caused by a change in the mitochondrial DNA. These genetic changes can make it hard for the cells of the body to make energy. Most cases of Pearson syndrome happen for the first time in a family which means it is not passed down from either parent (de novo genetic change). Diagnosis of Pearson syndrome is possible through a bone marrow biopsy, a urine test, or a special stool test. Genetic testing can be completed to confirm the diagnosis."
Summary of Pediatric T-cell leukemia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Peeling skin syndrome: Peeling skin syndrome (PSS) refers to a group of conditions that causes skin to peel and tear easily. The main symptom is continual peeling of the skin. The peeling skin is usually painless. Additional symptoms may depend on the form of PSS. Some people with PSS have itching, redness, and scarring. The symptoms of PSS can appear anytime from birth to adulthood, but usually occur by childhood. There are two forms of PSS. In the generalized form, skin peeling involves most of the body. The generalized form has two subtypes, noninflammatory and inflammatory. There is an acral form in which skin peeling is limited to the hands and feet. PSS is caused by genetic variants in several different genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. PSS is diagnosed based on the symptoms. Other more common conditions may need to be excluded."
Summary of Cerebral sclerosis similar to Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pelvic lipomatosis: Pelvic lipomatosis is a rare disease of unknown cause, characterized by overgrowth of mature, non-cancerous fat cells in the pelvic region. The symptoms of Pelvic lipomatosis are related to the compression of the urinary system (urinary frequency, dysuria, nocturia, and hematuria), lower intestinal tract (constipation, tenesmus, rectal bleeding, and ribbon-like stools with mucus), and vascular system (edema of lower extremities). Pelvic lipomatosis has been linked to chronic lower urinary tract infections, obesity, and endocrine dysfunction."
"Summary of Pemphigus: Pemphigus is a group of rare autoimmune diseases that cause blistering of the skin and mucous membranes (mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals). This condition can occur at any age, but often strikes people in middle or older age. Studies have shown that some populations may be at greater risk for certain types of Pemphigus. For instance, people of Jewish descent and those from India, Southeast Europe, and the Middle East are at greater risk for Pemphigus vulargis, while Pemphigus foliaceus is more common in North America, Turkey, and South America."
Summary of Pemphigus and fogo selvagem: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pemphigus foliaceus: A rare superficial pemphigus disease characterized by multiple, pruritic, scaly, crusted cutaneous erosions, with flaky circumscribed patches, localized mostly on the face, scalp, trunk and extremities, often presenting an erythematous base. Mucosal involvement is rarely observed."
"Summary of Pemphigus vulgaris: Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disorder that involves blistering and erosion of the skin and mucous membranes. It occurs almost exclusively in middle-aged or older people. The primary lesion of Pemphigus vulgaris is a soft blister filled with clear fluid that appears on healthy or irritated skin. Many cases begin with blisters in the mouth, followed by skin blisters that may come and go. The blisters inside the mouth can make it hard for the person to eat. The rupture of blisters on the skin may be painful and limit the person's daily activities. Complications due to infections can be serious and the damaging nature of the blisters can cause loss of body fluids and protein. The exact cause of Pemphigus vulgaris is unknown, but the blisters in Pemphigus vulgaris are associated with the binding of antibodies to the skin cells."
"Summary of Pentalogy of Cantrell: Pentalogy of Cantrell is a condition characterized by a combination of midline birth defects that can potentially involve the breastbone (sternum); the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen and aids in breathing (diaphragm); the thin membrane that lines the heart (pericardium); the abdominal wall; and the heart. It can have varying degrees of severity, and can be lethal. Most affected infants do not have all potential defects (incomplete Pentalogy of Cantrell). The exact cause of the condition is not known. Most cases occur sporadically, but familial cases have been reported."
"Summary of Polyarteritis nodosa: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a blood vessel disease characterized by inflammation of small and medium-sized arteries (vasculitis), preventing them from bringing oxygen and food to organs. Most cases occur in the 4th or 5th decade of life, although it can occur at any age. PAN most commonly affects vessels related to the skin, joints, peripheral nerves, gastrointestinal tract, heart, eyes, and kidneys. Symptoms are caused by damage to affected organs and may include fever, fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, muscle and joint aches, rashes, numbness, and abdominal pain. The underlying cause of PAN is unknown."
Summary of Perilymphatic fistula: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor: A central nervous system embryonal tumor, not otherwise specified arising from the supratentorial region."
"Summary of Peripheral T-cell lymphoma: A group of malignant lymphomas thought to derive from peripheral T-lymphocytes in lymph nodes and other nonlymphoid sites. They include a broad spectrum of lymphocyte morphology, but in all instances express T-cell markers admixed with epithelioid histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. Although markedly similar to large-cell immunoblastic lymphoma (LYMPHOMA, LARGE-CELL, IMMUNOBLASTIC), this group's unique features warrant separate treatment."
"Summary of Periventricular nodular heterotopia 1: Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a brain malformation, due to abnormal neuronal migration, in which a subset of neurons fails to migrate into the developing cerebral cortex and remains as nodules that line the ventricular surface. Classical PNH is a rare X-linked dominant disorder far more frequent in females who present normal intelligence to borderline intellectual deficit, epilepsy of variable severity and extra-central nervous system signs, especially cardiovascular defects or coagulopathy. The disorder is generally associated with prenatal lethality in males."
Summary of Perniosis: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Persistent truncus arteriosus: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Peters anomaly: Peters anomaly is a disorder of the eye which involves thinning and clouding of the cornea and attachment of the iris to the cornea, which causes blurred vision. It may also be associated with clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts) or other lens abnormalities. The cause of Peters anomaly is unknown; it may be caused by genetic factors (including alterations of several genes, like the FOXC1, PAX6, PITX2, or CYP1B1 genes, environmental factors, or both. The critical event must occur in the first trimester of pregnancy during the formation of the anterior chamber. Most cases of Peters anomaly are sporadic or inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Some few cases might be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Peters anomaly may occur as an isolated ocular abnormality or in association with other ocular defects. Peters anomaly is a feature of the Krause-Kivlin syndrome and the Peters-plus syndrome."
"Summary of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an inherited condition that is associated with an increased risk of growths along the lining of the gastrointestinal tract (called hamartomatous polyps) and certain types of cancer. Most affected people also have characteristic dark blue to dark brown macules around the mouth, eyes, and nostrils; near the anus (perianal); and on the inside of the cheeks (buccal mucosa). PJS is caused by changes in the STK11 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Pfeiffer syndrome: Pfeiffer syndrome is a disorder that affects the development of the bones in the skull, hands and feet. Signs and symptoms can include craniosynostosis, which prevents normal skull growth and affects the shape of the head and face; distinctive facial features including bulging and wide-set eyes, a high forehead, an underdeveloped upper jaw, and a beaked nose; hearing loss; and dental problems. Other features may include broad and deviated thumbs and great toes; brachydactyly; and syndactyly. It is caused by genetic changes in the FGFR1 or FGFR2 genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Liddle syndrome: Liddle syndrome is a rare, inherited condition that is primarily characterized by severe high blood pressure (hypertension) that often develops at an early age. Affected people may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) and metabolic alkalosis. Liddle syndrome is caused by genetic changes in either the SCNN1B or SCNN1G genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Phenylketonuria: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic metabolic disorder that increases the body's levels of phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is one of the building blocks (amino acids) of proteins. Humans cannot make phenyalanine, but it is a natural part of the foods we eat. However, people do not need all the phenyalanine they eat, so the body converts extra phenylalanine to another harmless amino acid, tyrosine. People with PKU cannot properly break down the extra phenylalanine to convert it to tyrosine. This means phenylalanine builds up in the person's blood, urine, and body. PKU varies from mild to severe. The most severe form is known as classic PKU. Without treatment, children with classic PKU develop permanent intellectual disability. Light skin and hair, seizures, developmental delays, behavioral problems, and psychiatric disorders are also common. Less severe forms, sometimes called ""mild PKU"", ""variant PKU"" and ""non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia"", have a smaller risk of brain damage. Mothers who have PKU and no longer follow a phenylalanine-restricted diet have an increased risk of having children with an intellectual disability, because their children may be exposed to very high levels of phenylalanine before birth. In most cases, PKU is caused by changes (pathogenic variants, also called genetic changes ) in the PAH gene. Inheritance is autosomal recessive manner. Because PKU can be detected by a simple blood test and is treatable, PKU is part of newborn screening."
Summary of Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloid leukemia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Roberts syndrome: Roberts syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by limb and facial abnormalities. Affected individuals are born with abnormalities of all four limbs and typically have shortened arm and leg bones (hypomelia). They may also have phocomelia (in severe cases); abnormal or missing fingers and toes; joint deformities (contractures); and numerous facial abnormalities including cleft lip with or without cleft palate; micrognathia; ear abnormalities; hypertelorism; down-slanting palpebral fissures; small nostrils; and a beaked nose. Microcephaly, intellectual disability, and heart, kidney or genital abnormalities may also be present. Infants with a severe form of Roberts syndrome are often stillborn or die shortly after birth, while mildly affected individuals may live into adulthood. It is caused by genetic changes in the ESCO2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to phosphoglycerate kinase 1 deficiency: A rare inborn errors of metabolism characterized by variable combinations of non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, myopathy, and various central nervous system abnormalities."
"Summary of Behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia: Pickâs disease is a neurological condition characterized by a slowly progressive deterioration of behavior, personality, or language. People with Pick's disease have abnormal substances (called Pick bodies) inside nerve cells in the damaged areas of the brain. Pick bodies contain an abnormal form of a protein called tau. This protein is found in all nerve cells, but people with Pick's disease have an abnormal amount or type of this protein. Symptoms often present sometime in the 50s, though it can occur as early as age 20 or as late as age 80. The course of the disease varies from person to person. The underlying cause of Pick's disease is unknown. In some cases, the disease runs in families."
"Summary of Tenosynovial giant cell tumor: Tenosynovial giant cell tumor is a disease in which the tissue lining the joints and tendons in the body (synovium) grows abnormally. It is characterized by a noncancerous mass or tumor. There are two types of Tenosynovial giant cell tumor: the local or nodular form (where the tumor involves the tendons that support the joint, or in one area of the joint) and the diffuse form (where the entire lining of the joint is involved). Symptoms might include: pain, limitation of movement, and locking of the joint. In some cases, the normal joint structure can be destroyed. The knee is most commonly affected by this condition, though it can occur in other joints such as the hip, shoulder, elbow, ankle, wrist, and rarely the jaw. The cause of Tenosynovial giant cell tumor is unknown."
"Summary of Pinta: An endemic bacterial infection caused by Treponema carateum. It is manifested with chronic cutaneous lesions. The early lesions consist of papules and erythematous plaques. The late lesions consist of hypochromic, achromic, hyperpigmented and atrophic lesions. The late skin lesions may cause destruction of bones and cartilage and produce disfiguring changes."
Summary of Isolated growth hormone deficiency type IA: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Pityriasis lichenoides chronica: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pityriasis rubra pilaris: Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) refers to a group of skin conditions that cause constant inflammation and scaling of the skin. People with PRP have reddish, scaly patches that may occur everywhere on the body, or only on certain areas. Some people with PRP also develop thickened skin on the underside of the hands and feet (palmoplantar keratoderma), various nail abnormalities, and/or thinning of the hair. In most cases, PRP is not inherited and the cause is not known. In some people, particularly some with type V (the 'atypical juvenile type'), PRP has autosomal dominant inheritance and may be caused by genetic changes in the CARD14 gene."
Summary of Placenta disorder: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Placental site trophoblastic tumor: Placental site trophoblastic tumor is a rare type of cancer that can happen after a pregnancy, miscarriage, or termination. It starts in the place where the placenta was attached to the uterus. This tumor is made up of cells that produce a hormone called human placental lactogen (hPL). Unlike other types of tumors, this one usually does not cause tissue death and bleeding is not severe.
Symptoms include irregular bleeding after a miscarriage or termination, or unexplained bleeding after a normal delivery or ectopic pregnancy. In some cases, the cancer may spread to other parts of the body."
Summary of Anaplastic plasmacytoma: A discrete mass of neoplastic monoclonal plasma cells either in the bone marrow or in an extramedullary location.
Summary of Plexosarcoma: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of POEMS syndrome: POEMS syndrome is a rare, mulitisystem disorder. POEMS stands for the disorder's features, which may include Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal gammopathy, and Skin changes. Signs and symptoms may include progressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy; enlarged liver, spleen, and/or lymph nodes; a disorder of the endocrine glands (often with multiple abnormalities); a monoclonal plasma cell proliferative disorder; and darkening of the skin (hyperpigmentation). Various other symptoms may also occur and may vary among affected people. The underlying cause of the disorder is not well understood."
"Summary of Poland syndrome: Poland syndrome is characterized by an underdeveloped or absent chest muscle on one side of the body, absence of the breastbone portion (sternal) of the chest muscle, and webbing of the fingers of the hand on the same side. The cause of Poland syndrome is not known. This syndrome is nearly always sporadic. It tends to occur on the right side and is more common in boys than girls."
"Summary of Poliomyelitis: Poliomyelitis is a viral disease that can affect nerves and can lead to partial or full paralysis. It is caused by infection with the poliovirus which can be spread by direct person-to-person contact, by contact with infected mucus or phlegm from the nose or mouth, or by contact with infected feces. There are three basic patterns of polio infection: subclinical infections, nonparalytic, and paralytic. Symptoms vary based on the pattern of infection and can range from asymptomatic with subclinical Poliomyelitis to partial or full paralysis. Since the development of the polio vaccine, the incidence of the disease has been greatly reduced."
"Summary of Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa: Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (CPAN) is a rare limited form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN, see this term), characterized by cutaneous vasculitis and mild and transient extracutaneous manifestations such as mild arthralgia, arthritis,myalgia, and rarely peripheral neuropathy."
"Summary of Relapsing polychondritis: Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is characterized by recurrent swelling and inflammation of cartilage and other tissues throughout the body. Cartilage is a tough but flexible tissue that covers the ends of bones at a joint and gives shape and support to other parts of the body. Other parts of the body that may be involved are the airways (trachea), costal (rib) cartilage, eyes, heart, vascular (veins) system, skin, kidney, and nervous system. The signs and symptoms vary from person to person depending on which parts of the body are affected. The exact underlying cause of RP is unknown. There are thought to be genetic and other unknown factors involved. RP often occurs along with autoimmune conditions. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and clinical examination. Other more common conditions may need to be excluded before RP can be diagnosed."
Summary of Polycystic kidney disease: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Polycystic ovarian syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Polycythemia vera: Polycythemia vera is a condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells in the bloodstream (erythrocytosis). Affected people may also have excess white blood cells and platelets. Conditions where the body makes too many of these cells are known as myeloproliferative neoplasms. These extra cells cause the blood to be thicker than normal, increasing the risk for blood clots that can block blood flow in arteries and veins. If a blood clot occurs in the veins deep in the arms and the legs, it is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A DVT can sometimes travel through the blood stream to the lungs, which can cause a pulmonary embolism and is very dangerous. A blood clot could also travel to the heart or brain, which leads to an increased risk for heart attack or stroke. Most cases of PV are not inherited and are acquired during a person's lifetime. PV occurs more frequently in men than it does in women. The condition has been associated with genetic changes in the JAK2 and TET2 genes. In rare cases, the risk for PV runs in families and may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Polymyositis: Polymyositis is a type of inflammatory myopathy, which refers to a group of muscle diseases characterized by chronic muscle inflammation and weakness. The muscles affected by Polymyositis are the skeletal muscles (those involved with making movements) on both sides of the body. The disease is more common among women and among black individuals. The exact cause of Polymyositis is unknown. The disease shares many characteristics with autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy body tissues. In some cases, the disease may be associated with viral infections, connective tissue disorders, or an increased risk for malignancies (cancer). Diagnosis is based on a clinical examination that may include laboratory tests, imaging studies, electromyography, and a muscle biopsy."
"Summary of Porencephaly: Porencephaly is a rare condition that affects the central nervous system. People with Porencephaly develop fluid-filled cysts or cavities in the brain either before or shortly after birth. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary significantly based on the size, location, and number of cysts. Common features include developmental delay, reduced muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, macrocephaly (unusually large head size), spastic hemiplegia, speech problems, delayed growth, and intellectual disability. Porencephaly is usually the result of damage from infection or stroke after birth. In these cases, the condition occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. There is an inherited form of the condition called familial Porencephaly, which is caused by changes in the COL4A1 or COL4A2 genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Eccrine porocarcinoma: Eccrine porocarcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer that may occur by chance or may develop from a benign (non-cancerous) skin tumor. They affect the eccrine sweat glands, which are the major sweat glands of the body. Eccrine porocarcinoma usually are found in adults older than 60 and appear as a single red elevated solid mass (nodule) or a thickened or elevated lesion (plaque). They are found anywhere on the body, but occur most commonly on the lower limbs, head, and upper limbs. Most people with an Eccrine porocarcinoma do not have symptoms; however some individuals may notice bleeding from the tumor or itching. Factors that may increase the risk to develop an Eccrine porocarcinoma include family history, suppression of the immune system, and exposure to ultraviolet light or radiation."
"Summary of Porphyria cutanea tarda: Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a form of porphyria that primarily affects the skin. People affected by this condition generally experience ""photosensitivity,"" which causes painful, blistering lesions to develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin (i.e. the hands and face). Skin in these areas may also be particularly fragile with blistering and/or peeling after minor trauma. In some cases, increased hair growth as well as darkening and thickening of the affected skin may occur. Liver abnormalities may develop in some people with the condition and PCT, in general, is associated with an increased risk of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. In most cases, PCT is a complex or multifactorial condition that is likely associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. For example, factors such as excess iron, alcohol, estrogens, smoking, chronic hepatitis C, HIV and genetic changes in the HFE gene (which is associated with the disease hemochromatosis) can all contribute to the development of PCT. Less commonly, PCT can run in families (called familial PCT). Familial PCT is caused by changes in the UROD gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
Summary of Post-traumatic epilepsy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Posterior urethral valve: A rare, congenital, fetal lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO) anomaly characterized by an abnormal congenital obstructing membrane or leaflets that are located within the posterior urethra associated with significant obstruction of the male bladder restricting normal bladder emptying."
"Summary of Smallpox: A condition that is caused by infection with Variola, and that is characterized by small, raised bumps."
"Summary of Rare precocious puberty: Precocious puberty is when a person's sexual and physical traits develop and mature earlier than normal. Normal puberty typically begins between ages 10 and 14 for girls, and ages 12 and 16 for boys. The start of puberty depends on various factors such as family history, nutrition and gender. The cause of Precocious puberty is not always known. Some cases of Precocious puberty are due to conditions that cause changes in the body's release of hormones."
"Summary of Primary agammaglobulinemia: A lasting absence of total IgG and total IgA and total IgM in the blood circulation, whereby at most trace quantities can be measured."
Summary of Primary hyperaldosteronism: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Primary biliary cholangitis: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, progressive liver disease in which the bile ducts become inflamed and damaged. This leads to the buildup of bile and causes liver problems such as scarring, cirrhosis (scarring and poor liver function), and eventual liver failure. PBC is more common in women. Many people do not have symptoms when they are first diagnosed and may not develop symptoms for several years. Early symptoms may include fatigue (the most common symptom), itchy skin (pruritus), and abdominal pain. As the disease progresses, people with PBC may develop weakness, nausea, diarrhea, swelling in the legs and feet (edema), bone and joint pain, jaundice, dark urine, and xanthomas. The symptoms of PBC can significantly impair quality of life. The diagnosis of PBC may involve blood tests, imaging studies (such as X-ray or ultrasound), and sometimes, a liver biopsy. Blood tests may include tests for anti-mitochondrial antibodies (which may confirm the diagnosis), liver function tests, and cholesterol tests. Abnormal blood test results commonly lead to the diagnosis in people with PBC who do not have symptoms. PBC is considered an autoimmune disease in which the immune system malfunctions and mistakenly attacks a person's healthy bile duct cells, causing the inflammation and damage. It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers (multifactorial inheritance)."
"Summary of Prinzmetal's variant angina: Prinzmetal's variant angina (PVA) is characterized by recurrent episodes of chest pain (angina) that usually occur when a person is at rest, between midnight and early morning. Typical angina, by contrast, is often triggered by physical exertion or emotional stress. Episodes of PVA can be very painful, and may last from several minutes to thirty minutes. In some cases the pain may spread from the chest to the head, shoulder, or arm. The pain associated with PVA is caused by a spasm in the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (coronary arteries). This results in an obstruction of blood flow. In some people, persistent spasms increase the risk for serious complications such as a life-threatening arrhythmia or heart attack. PVA most commonly occurs in people who smoke and people who have high cholesterol or high blood pressure. In many cases it occurs for unknown reasons in otherwise healthy people. In some cases it may be triggered by alcohol withdrawal, stress, exposure to cold, certain medications, or use of stimulants such as cocaine. The diagnosis of PVA involves findings on an electrocardiogram, evidence of the spasms on angiogram, and relief of sudden symptoms with medicines called nitrates."
"Summary of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome: Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome leads to extreme premature aging and affects many different body systems. The symptoms begin within a year of life with poor growth and weight gain. Children with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome have a characteristic facial appearance with a large head, small mouth and chin, narrow nose and large eyes. Other symptoms include baldness, loss of fat under the skin, and dental and joint abnormalities. They also often have symptoms typically seen in much older people including joint stiffness, hip dislocations and severe, progressive heart disease. Intelligence is typically normal. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is caused by a genetic variant in the LMNA gene. This variant usually arises as a new change in the genetic material and is not inherited from a parent. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a neurological disorder that damages the myelin that covers and protects nerves in the white matter of the brain. It is caused by the JC virus (JCV). The disease occurs, rarely, in organ transplant patients; people undergoing chronic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy; and individuals with cancer, such as Hodgkinâs disease, lymphoma, and sarcoidosis. PML is most common among individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
"Summary of Progressive supranuclear palsy: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a degenerative neurologic disease due to damage to nerve cells in the brain. Signs and symptoms vary but may include loss of balance; blurring of vision; problems controlling eye movement; changes in mood, behavior and judgment; cognitive decline; and slowing and slurred speech. PSP is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson disease due to similar symptoms. Most cases of PSP appear to be sporadic, but familial cases have been reported. Some cases have been found to be caused by a genetic change in the MAPT gene, and other genetic factors are being studied."
"Summary of Prolidase deficiency: Prolidase deficiency is a rare metabolic condition characterized by skin lesions, recurrent infections, unusual facial features, variable intellectual disability, enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) with elevated liver enzymes, and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly). Symptoms typically present during infancy and vary greatly among affected individuals. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the PEPD gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Proteus syndrome: Proteus syndrome is characterized by excessive growth of a part or portion of the body. The overgrowth is usually asymmetric, which means it affects the right and left sides of the body differently. Newborns with Proteus syndrome have few or no signs of the disorder. It may result in differences in appearance and with time, an increased risk for blood clots and tumors. Some people with Proteus syndrome have neurological abnormalities, including intellectual disability, seizures, and vision loss, as well as distinctive facial features. Proteus syndrome is caused by a change in the AKT1 gene. It is not inherited, but occurs as a random genetic change in a body cell in a developing baby (fetus) early in pregnancy. The AKT1 genetic change affects only a portion of the body cells. This is why only a portion of the body is affected and why individuals with Proteus syndrome can be very differently affected."
Summary of Protoporphyria: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Prune belly syndrome: Prune belly syndrome (PBS) is a condition characterized by a lack of abdominal muscles, causing the skin on the abdominal area to wrinkle and appear ""prune-like""; undescended testicles in males; and urinary tract malformations. PBS is more common in males. The severity of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. At one end of the spectrum, the condition may cause severe kidney and pulmonary (lung) problems incompatible with life (resulting in stillbirth); at the other end of the spectrum, the condition may cause few, if any, urological abnormalities. The cause of PBS is unknown."
"Summary of Prurigo nodularis: Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a skin disease that causes hard, itchy lumps (nodules) to form on the skin. The itching (pruritus) can be intense, causing people to scratch themselves to the point of bleeding or pain. Scratching can cause more skin lesions to appear. In some cases, people with PN have a history of other diseases including eczema (atopic dermatitis), lymphoma, HIV infection, severe anemia, or kidney disease. The exact cause of PN is unknown. Although scratching is known to cause more nodules to appear, it is unclear what causes the itching to develop in the first place. Diagnosis of the disease is based on observing signs such as extremely itchy skin with the formation of nodules. In some cases, a skin biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency: Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency is a condition that causes increased sensitivity to certain muscle relaxant drugs used during general anesthesia (choline esters). These drugs relax the muscles used for movement, including those used for breathing. Normally, the muscles are able to move again a few minutes after the drugs are given. People with Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency may not be able to move or breathe on their own for a few hours after these drugs are given. They therefore may need mechanical ventilation until the drugs are cleared from the body. People with this condition may also have increased sensitivity to other types of drugs as well as to some agricultural pesticides. Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency can be inherited (genetic) or acquired. When it is inherited, it is autosomal recessive and caused by genetic changes in the BCHE gene. Acquired Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency may have various causes such as chronic infection, kidney or liver disease, malnutrition, major burns, cancer, or various medications."
"Summary of Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A: Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A (PHP1A) is a type of pseudohypoparathyroidism. Pseudohypoparathyroidism occurs when your body is unable to respond to parathyroid hormone, a hormone that controls the levels of calcium, phosphorous, and vitamin D in the blood. The symptoms are very similar to hypoparathyroidism, a condition that occurs parathyroid hormone levels are too low. PHP1A results in low calcium levels and high phosphate levels in the blood. Symptoms are generally first seen in childhood. Symptoms may include cataracts, dental problems, seizures, numbness, and muscle spasms in the hands and feet. People with PHP1A don't respond to other hormones produced by the body, such as thyroid-stimulating hormone and gonadotropins. PHP1A is also associated with a group of symptoms referred to as Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy, which includes short stature, a round face, obesity, and short hand bones. Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A is caused by a genetic variation in the GNAS gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. PHP1A is diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and other laboratory tests. It may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
Summary of Pseudomonas stutzeri infections: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pseudomyxoma peritonei: Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare disease characterized by the presence of mucin in the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity. While the most common cause of PMP is appendix cancer, several types of tumors (including non-cancerous tumors) can cause PMP. Signs and symptoms may include an increase in abdominal size or bloating; inguinal hernia (in men); an ovarian mass that may be felt during a routine pelvic exam (in women); pain or discomfort in the abdomen; and/or appendicitis."
"Summary of Psittacosis: Disease caused by the Chlamydophila psittaci bacteria, usually transmitted from birds to humans."
"Summary of Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (aPAP) is a rare autoimmune lung disorder. It is the most common form (90% of the cases) of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). Some people may not show symptoms, while others may have progressive difficulty breathing and shortness of breath upon exertion. Other signs and symptoms may include a dry, chronic cough; fatigue; weight loss; chest pain; and a general feeling of ill health. In rare cases, coughing up of blood, rounding and swelling of the tips of the fingers, and cyanosis may be present. Autoimmune PAP is caused by an immune system malfunction, due to IgG antibodies that block the granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) effect. GM-CSF is a protein that regulates clearance of surfactant (a mix of protein and fat) by alveolar macrophages. The surfactant pile up in the air sacs of the lungs (alveoli), and eventually lead to an inability to breath."
"Summary of Pulmonary arterial hypertension: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) affects the heart and lungs. It is characterized by abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension) in the pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea) during exercise and fainting spells. The symptoms tend to get worse over time and may include dizziness, swelling (edema) of the ankles or legs, chest pain, and a racing pulse. Some cases of PAH are due to genetic changes in the BMPR2 gene and inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Most cases of PAH occur in individuals with no family history of the disorder. When PAH is inherited from an affected relative it is called ""familial"" PAH. Cases with no identifiable cause may be referred to as ""idiopathic"" PAH. PAH can also occur secondary to underlying conditions such as connective tissue diseases, HIV infection, chronic hemolytic anemia, and congenital heart disease. PAH can also be induced by certain drugs and toxins. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical examination, and specialized testing."
"Summary of Punctate inner choroidopathy: Punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the choroid (vascular layer) of the eye. It most commonly occurs in young, near-sighted (myopic) women. The symptoms and severity may vary from person to person. Symptoms may include a blind spot (scotomata), blurred vision, photopsia (perceived flashes of light), floaters, light sensitivity (photophobia), distorted vision, and/or loss of peripheral vision. The exact cause of PIC is not known, but it is thought to involve both genetic predisposition and environmental factors."
"Summary of Pure red cell aplasia: Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare condition that affects the bone marrow. Bone marrow contains stem cells which develop into the red blood cells that carry oxygen through the body, the white blood cells that fight infections, and the platelets that help with blood clotting. In people with PRCA, the bone marrow makes a reduced number of red blood cells (called anemia). As a result, affected people may experience fatigue, lethargy, and pale skin. PRCA has many different causes. A rare congenital form of PRCA, called Diamond Blackfan syndrome, is an inherited condition that is also associated with other physical abnormalities. PRCA can also be due to certain medications, infections, pregnancy, renal failure, and conditions such as thymomas, autoimmune disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), cancers of the blood, and solid tumors. In many cases, the cause of the condition is unknown (idiopathic)."
Summary of Purpura simplex: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pyoderma gangrenosum: Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, destructive inflammatory skin disease of which a painful nodule or pustule breaks down to form a progressively enlarging ulcer. Lesions may occur either in the absence of any apparent underlying disorder or in association with other diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, polyarthritis (an inflammation of several joints together), gammopathy, vasculitis, leukemia, and other conditions. Each year in the United States, Pyoderma gangrenosum occurs in about 1 person per 100,000 people. Pyoderma gangrenosum belongs to a group of autoinflammatory skin diseases called neutrophilic dermatoses. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell or leukocyte which form an early line of defense against bacterial infections. Ulcerations associated with Pyoderma gangrenosum may occur after trauma or injury to the skin, a process called pathergy."
"Summary of Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency: Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes lactic acid and other potentially toxic compounds to accumulate in the blood. High levels of these substances can damage the body's organs and tissues, particularly in the nervous system. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the PC gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency: Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency is a type of metabolic disease. This means that the body is not able to efficiently break down nutrients in food to be used for energy. Symptoms of PDC deficiency include signs of metabolic dysfunction such as extreme tiredness (lethargy), poor feeding, and rapid breathing (tachypnea). Other symptoms may include signs of neurological dysfunction such as developmental delay, periods of uncontrolled movements (ataxia), low muscle tone (hypotonia), abnormal eye movements, and seizures. Symptoms usually begin in infancy, but signs can first appear at birth or later in childhood. Symptoms may be especially apparent during times of illness, stress, or after meals with high amounts of carbohydrates. The most common form of PDC deficiency is caused by genetic changes (genetic changes or pathogenic variants) in the PDHA1 gene. These pathogenic variants are inherited in an X-linked manner. Pathogenic variants in other genes including PDHB, DLAT, PDHX, DLD, and PDP1 can also cause PDC deficiency. These pathogenic variants are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. PDC deficiency is diagnosed based on laboratory tests including blood tests, analysis of the urine, and brain MRI. The diagnosis can be confirmed by analyzing the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme."
"Summary of Hemolytic anemia due to red cell pyruvate kinase deficiency: Hemolytic anemia due to red cell pyruvate kinase deficiency is a genetic blood disorder characterized by low levels of an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is used by red blood cells. Without pyruvate kinase, red blood cells break down too easily, resulting in low levels of these cells (hemolytic anemia). The signs and symptoms of the disease may vary greatly from person to person. However, they usually include jaundice, enlargement of the spleen, and mild or severe hemolysis (red cell breakdown), leading to anemia. In some cases, the problems may first appear while in utero, causing a condition in which abnormal amounts of fluid build up in two or more body areas of the fetus (hydrops fetalis). Newborns may present with prolonged jaundice and anemia. Older children may be pale (due to anemia) and have intermittent episodes of jaundice. Mild cases may escape detection until adulthood. Although the anemia tends to stabilize in adulthood, episodes of anemia may occur with acute infections, stress, and pregnancy. Hemolytic anemia due to red cell pyruvate kinase deficiency is caused by a genetic change in the PKLR gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Q fever: Q fever is a worldwide disease with acute and chronic stages caused by the bacteria known as Coxiella burnetii. Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs although a variety of species may be infected. Organisms are excreted in birth fluids, milk, urine, and feces of infected animals and are able to survive for long periods in the environment. Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and waste products of infected animals. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites, ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products, and human to human transmission, are rare. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection. In less than 5% of cases the affected people with acute Q fever infection develop a chronic Q fever."
Summary of Rabies: Rabies is a viral zoonosis leading to a fatal encephalopathy if not treated.
Summary of Radiation induced angiosarcoma of the breast: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Radiation induced cancer: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Ramon syndrome: A rare, genetic, primary bone dysplasia syndrome characterized by bilateral, painless swelling of the face extending from the mandible to the inferior orbital margins (cherubism), epilepsy, gingival fibromatosis (possibly obscuring teeth), and intellectual disability. Other associated variable features include hypertrichosis, stunted growth, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and development of ocular abnormalities (e.g. pigmentary retinopathy, optic disc pallor, Axenfeld anomaly). Radiological images typically show bilateral multifocal radiolucency involving the body, angle and ramus of the mandible and coronoid process."
"Summary of Ramsay Hunt syndrome: Ramsay Hunt syndrome, also known as Herpes zoster oticus, is a common complication of shingles, an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (which is the virus that also causes chickenpox). Shingles occurs in people who have had chickenpox and in whom the varicella-zoster virus becomes active again. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the spread of the virus to facial nerves and can cause intense ear pain; a rash around the ear, mouth, face, neck, and scalp; and paralysis of the face. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, vertigo (feeling that the room is spinning), tinnitus (hearing abnormal sounds), nausea, vomiting, loss of taste in the tongue, and dry mouth and eyes."
"Summary of Rasmussen encephalitis: Rasmussen encephalitis is a chronic inflammatory neurological disease that usually affects only one hemisphere of the brain. Rasmussen encephalitis is characterized by frequent and severe seizures, loss of motor skills and speech, paralysis on one side of the body (hemiparesis), inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), and mental deterioration. While the cause of Rasmussen encephalitis is unknown, there is evidence that in many patients it is an autoimmune disorder."
"Summary of Familial renal glucosuria: Renal glycosuria is a rare condition in which glucose is excreted in the urine despite normal or low blood glucose levels. With normal kidney function, glucose is excreted in the urine only when there are abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood. However, in people with Renal glycosuria, glucose is abnormally eliminated in the urine due to improper functioning of the renal tubules, which are the primary components of the filtering units of the kidneys. In most people with Renal glycosuria, there are no apparent symptoms or serious effects. Rare cases of polyuria (increased urine output), enuresis (involuntary urination), and mild delays in growth and maturation during puberty have been reported. When Renal glycosuria occurs as an isolated finding with otherwise normal kidney function, the condition is thought to be caused by genetic changes in the SLC5A2 gene."
Summary of Renal rickets: Abnormalities of bone mineral metabolism associated with chronic kidney disease.
"Summary of Primary renal tubular acidosis: A group of rare renal tubular diseases characterized by primary defects in bicarbonate reabsorption from urine (proximal renal tubular acidosis) and/or hydrogen excretion into the lumen (distal renal tubular acidosis), resulting in metabolic acidosis with hyperchloremia and a normal plasma anion gap. The glomerular filtration rate is relatively normal."
Summary of Renoprival hypertension: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Reticuloendotheliosis: A greater than normal number of blood cells in the reticuloendothelial system.
"Summary of Retinoblastoma: Retinoblastoma (RB) is a rare type of eye cancer in the retina that typically develops in early childhood. It usually affects only one eye, but 1/3 of children with RB develop cancer in both eyes. The first sign is typically a visible whiteness in the pupil called ""cat's eye reflex"" or leukocoria, which is particularly noticeable in photographs taken with a flash. Other signs and symptoms include strabismus; persistent eye pain, redness or irritation; and blindness or poor vision in the affected eye(s). Retinoblastoma is caused by genetic changes in the RB1 gene. In about 60% of people with Retinoblastoma, genetic changes are not inherited and occur only in retinal cells. In the other 40% of individuals, genetic changes are inherited from a parent in an autosomal dominant pattern and can be found in all body cells. Retinoblastoma that is caused by an inherited genetic change is called hereditary Retinoblastoma. Hereditary Retinoblastoma usually occurs at a younger age than Retinoblastoma that is not inherited (15 months vs. 24 months). Retinoblastoma that occurs in only one eye is usually not inherited. Retinoblastoma that occurs in both eyes is thought to be inherited."
"Summary of Reye syndrome: A rare, systemic disease characterized by persistent vomiting with confusion, lethargy, disorientation, hyperreflexia, hyperventilation, and tachycardia, with rapid progression to seizures, non-inflammatory encephalopathy, coma and death. It typically develops between 12 hours and 3 weeks after recovery from a viral illness, such as upper respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis. Hepatomegaly, acute hepatic steatosis, fatty liver degeneration and multiple laboratory abnormalities are associated."
"Summary of Rhabdoid tumor: Rhabdoid tumor (RT) is an aggressive pediatric soft tissue sarcoma that arises in the kidney, the liver, the peripheral nerves and all miscellaneous soft-parts throughout the body. RT involving the central nervous system (CNS) is called atypical teratoid Rhabdoid tumor. RT usually occurs in infancy or childhood. In most cases, the first symptoms are linked to the compressive effects of a bulky tumor (such as respiratory distress, abdominal mass, peripheral nerve palsy). In about 90% of cases it is caused by a genetic change in the SMARCB1 gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene. In rare cases, it may be caused by a genetic change in the SMARCA4 gene. No standard care exists for RT, although there are many ongoing studies."
"Summary of Rheumatoid vasculitis: Necrotizing VASCULITIS of small and medium size vessels, developing as a complication in RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS patients. It is characterized by peripheral vascular lesions, cutaneous ULCERS, peripheral GANGRENE, and MONONEURITIS MULTIPLEX."
"Summary of Richter syndrome: Richter syndrome is a rare condition in which chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) changes into a fast-growing type of lymphoma. Symptoms of Richter syndrome can include fever, loss of weight and muscle mass, abdominal pain, and enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Laboratory results may show anemia and low platelet counts (which can lead to easy bleeding and bruising)."
"Summary of Familial dysautonomia: Familial dysautonomia (FD) affects nerve cells in the autonomic nervous system, the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary functions like breathing and digestion. The symptoms of FD are present at birth and include difficulty swallowing, and poor control of blood pressure, body temperature and breathing. Other symptoms may include the inability to make tears or feel pain, vomiting episodes, frequent pneumonia, and difficulty walking. Over time, the symptoms of FD tend to get worse and are often life-threatening. FD is caused by genetic variations in the ELP1 gene, and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Rocky Mountain spotted fever: Rocky mountain spotted fever refers to an infection caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsia. This particular bacterium is carried by certain species of ticks and spread to humans through the bites of infected ticks. Signs and symptoms of the condition generally develop approximately 2 to 14 days following the tick bite and may include fever, rash, headache, muscle pain, chills, and/or confusion. Some affected people may also experience diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, hallucinations, and/or excessive thirst. Most cases occur in the spring and summer and are found in children. Risk factors for developing the condition include recent hiking or exposure to ticks in an area where the disease is known to occur."
"Summary of Rosaï-Dorfman disease: Rosai-Dorfman disease is a benign disease which is characterized by over-production and accumulation of a specific type of white blood cell (histiocyte) in the lymph nodes of the body, most often those of the neck (cervical). Other lymph node groups may also be involved and, in some cases, abnormal accumulation of histiocytes may occur in other areas of the body (extranodal). The cause of this condition remains unknown, although altered immune responses and infectious agents may play a role."
"Summary of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a syndrome characterized by broad thumbs and toes, short stature, distinctive facial features, and varying degrees of intellectual disability. The syndrome may be caused by a genetic change in the CREBBP or EP300 gene, or as the result of a very small loss (microdeletion) of genetic material from the short (p) arm of chromosome 16. In some people with RTS, the cause is unknown. While RTS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, most cases result from a new (de novo) genetic change in the responsible gene and are not inherited from a parent."
"Summary of Rumination disorder: Rumination disorder is the backward flow of recently eaten food from the stomach to the mouth. The food is then re-chewed and swallowed or spat out. A non-purposeful contraction of stomach muscles is involved in rumination. It may be initially triggered by a viral illness, emotional distress, or physical injury. In many cases, no underlying trigger is identified."
Summary of Sacral plexopathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis). This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape and symmetry of the head and face. Other features may include webbing of certain fingers or toes (syndactyly), small or unusually shaped ears, short stature, and abnormalities of the bones in the spine (the vertebrae). The signs and symptoms of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome vary widely, even among affected individuals in the same family. Genetic changes (variants) in the TWIST1 gene cause most cases of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In some cases, an affected person inherits the genetic change from one affected parent. Other cases may result from new genetic changes in the gene."
"Summary of SAPHO syndrome: SAPHO syndrome involves any combination of: Synovitis (inflammation of the joints), Acne, Pustulosis (thick yellow blisters containing pus) often on the palms and soles, Hyperostosis (increase in bone substance) and Osteitis (inflammation of the bones). The cause of SAPHO syndrome is unknown.."
"Summary of Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by the development and growth of tiny lumps of cells called granulomas. If these tiny granulomas grow and clump together in an organ, they can affect the organ's structure and function. Overtime, this can lead to permanent scarring or thickening of the organ tissue (also called fibrosis). Although the granulomas can be found in almost any part of the body, they occur most commonly in the lungs and lymph nodes. Signs and symptoms of Sarcoidosis vary based on the location of the granulomas and the severity of the condition. The exact cause of Sarcoidosis is poorly understood."
"Summary of X-linked scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy: X-linked scapuloperoneal myopathy is an inherited muscular dystrophy characterized by weakness and wasting of the muscles in the lower legs and the area of the shoulder blades. In some individuals, facial muscles may also be affected. Some cases of scapuloperoneal myopathy are caused by genetic changes in the FHL1 gene. These cases are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner."
"Summary of Pigmented purpuric dermatosis: Pigmented purpuric dermatosis is a chronic condition characterized by reddish-brown skin lesions caused by leaky capillaries. Although they can arise on any part of the body, they are most commonly located on the lower legs. In some cases, the skin lesions cause severe itching. The skin lesions may spread over time, or clear up on their own. The cause of Pigmented purpuric dermatosis is unknown."
"Summary of Familial Scheuermann disease: Familial Scheuermann disease is characterized by kyphotic deformity of the spine that develops in adolescence. The spinal deformity includes irregularities of the vertebral endplates, the presence of Schmorl's nodes, disk-space narrowing, and vertebral wedging and is diagnosed using lateral radiographs of the spine. The thoracic spine is most often affected, but the lumbar spine may also be involved. Analysis of the mode of inheritance in a sample of 90 pedigrees derived from the Siberian population supported an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with complete penetrance in boys and incomplete penetrance in girls."
"Summary of Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 2: Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 2 is an autoimmune disorder that affects many hormone-producing (endocrine) glands. It is characterized by the presence of Addison's disease along with autoimmune thyroid disease and/or type 1 diabetes. Affected individuals may also have problems with other endocrine glands and other common features include primary hypogonadism, myasthenia gravis, and celiac disease. Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 2 is diagnosed in adulthood. The cause of Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 2 is unknown, although it may involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. This condition occurs more often in women than men. Currently, there are no unique tests to detect Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 2, but testing for autoantibodies may be helpful in assessing disease risk, since the relevant autoantibodies (such as antibodies to thyroid peroxidase in autoimmune thyroid disease, or to glutamic acid decarboxylase in type 1 diabetes) are frequently detectable years before disease onset."
"Summary of Scleromyxedema: Scleromyxedema is a rare, severe skin disorder. Signs and symptoms include abnormal accumulation of mucin in the skin (mucinosis), causing papular and sclerodermoid bumps; increased production of fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) in the absence of a thyroid disorder; and monoclonal gammopathy (abnormal proteins in the blood). It often involves internal organs and may affect various body systems. The cause of Scleromyxedema is not known."
"Summary of Kuru: A rare acquired human prion disease characterized by rapidly progressive, fatal neurodegeneration, caused by the consumption of prion-containing tissue in endocannibalistic funeral rituals in Papua New Guinea until the late 1950s. After a decades-long asymptomatic period and a non-specific prodromal phase with headaches and arthralgia, the most prominent neurological feature is ataxia, in addition to other symptoms involving the cerebellum, brain stem, mid-brain, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex, and emotional changes including inappropriate euphoria and compulsive laughter, or depression and apprehension. The last reported patient died in 2005 with an incubation period extending over four decades."
Summary of Selenium poisoning: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Septo-optic dysplasia spectrum: Septo-optic dysplasia is a disorder of early brain and eye development. The most common features are underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the eye (optic) nerve, abnormal formation of structures along the midline of the brain such as the absence of the septum pellucidum and the corpus callosum, and a small pituitary (pituitary hypoplasia). Signs and symptoms may include blindness in one or both eyes, an abnormal pupil dilation in response to light, nystagmus (abnormal movement of the eyes), low muscular tone and hormonal problems. Additional features may include recurring seizures, delayed development, intellectual disability, jaundice (yellow-ish skin), precocious puberty, short stature, sleep problems, obesity, lack of smell (anosmia), hearing loss and heart anomalies. Although the cause is unknown in most cases, very few people with SOD may have variations in the HESX1 OTX2, SOX2 or SOX3 genes. Other factors that may be involved are viral infections, certain medications and a blood flow disruption. Typically, people do not have a family history of septo-optic dysplasia. However, there have been a few cases in which multiple family members have been diagnosed. In these cases inheritance can be autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Severe combined immunodeficiency: Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) are inherited immune system disorders characterized by abnormalities with responses of both T cells and B cells (specific types of white blood cells needed for immune system function). Common signs and symptoms include an increased susceptibility to infections including ear infections; pneumonia or bronchitis; oral thrush; and diarrhea. Due to recurrent infections, children with SCID do not grow and gain weight as expected (failure to thrive). SCID may be caused by genetic changes in any of several genes and can be inherited in an X-linked recessive (most commonly) or autosomal recessive manner. The most common type of SCID is called X-linked Severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). Another form of SCID is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA)."
"Summary of Sézary syndrome: Sezary syndrome is an aggressive form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma which is a group of disorders that occur when T-cells (a type of white blood cell) become cancerous and affect the skin. It is characterized by a widespread red rash that may cover most of the body, the presence of cancerous T cells (called Sezary cells) in the blood, and abnormally enlarged lymph nodes. Other signs and symptoms may include intense itchiness, scaling and peeling of the skin; fever; weight loss; hair loss; outward turning of the eyelids (ectropion); palmoplantar keratoderma; malformation of the nails; and hepatosplenomegaly. The exact cause of Sezary syndrome is currently unknown."
"Summary of Sheehan syndrome: Sheehan syndrome affects the function of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland makes hormones and regulates other glands and many body processes, including reproduction. The cause of Sheehan syndrome is severe blood loss during or after childbirth (postpartum hemorrhage). This leads to lack of blood flow to the front part of the pituitary gland, causing it to gradually stop functioning. The symptoms of Sheehan syndrome occur as a result of the low hormone levels. These may include an inability to produce breast milk, irregular or absent periods, hot flashes, and a decreased sex drive. Other symptoms may include fatigue, headaches, low blood pressure, and hair loss. In some cases, the symptoms occur immediately and may be more severe and sometimes life threatening. Sheehan syndrome is diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical history and exam, laboratory testing, and imaging studies."
"Summary of SHORT syndrome: SHORT syndrome is a condition characterized by multiple abnormalities that affect several parts of the body. The term SHORT is an acronym with each letter representing a common feature in affected individuals: (S) short stature; (H) hyperextensibility of joints and/or hernia (inguinal); (O) ocular depression (deep-set eyes); (R) Rieger anomaly (defective development of the anterior chamber of the eye that can lead to glaucoma); and (T) teething delay. Other features commonly present include a triangular face, small chin with a dimple, loss of fat under the skin (lipodystrophy), abnormal position of the ears, hearing loss and delayed speech. It is caused by genetic changes in the PIK3R1 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Shwartzman phenomenon: Hemorrhagic necrosis that was first demonstrated in rabbits with a two-step reaction, an initial local (intradermal) or general (intravenous) injection of a priming endotoxin (ENDOTOXINS) followed by a second intravenous endotoxin injection (provoking agent) 24 h later. The acute inflammation damages the small blood vessels. The following intravascular coagulation leads to capillary and venous THROMBOSIS and NECROSIS. Shwartzman phenomenon can also occur in other species with a single injection of a provoking agent, and during infections or pregnancy. Its susceptibility depends on the status of IMMUNE SYSTEM, coagulation, FIBRINOLYSIS, and blood flow."
"Summary of Sialadenitis: Sialadenitis is an infection of the salivary glands. It is usually caused by a virus or bacteria. The parotid (in front of the ear) and submandibular (under the chin) glands are most commonly affected. Sialadenitis may be associated with pain, tenderness, redness, and gradual, localized swelling of the affected area. Sialadenitis most commonly affects the elderly and chronically ill especially those with dry mouth or who are dehydrated, but can also affected people of any age including newborn babies. Diagnosis is usually made by clinical exam but a CT scan, MRI scan or ultrasound may be done if the doctor suspects an abscess or to look for stones."
"Summary of Sialidosis type 1: Sialidosis is a severe inherited disorder that affects many organs and tissues, including the nervous system. This disorder is divided into two types, which are distinguished by the age at which symptoms appear and the severity of features. Sialidosis type I is the less severe form of this condition. People with this condition typically develop signs and symptoms of sialidosis in their teens or twenties. Characteristic features may include sudden involuntary muscle contractions (myoclonus), distinctive red spots (cherry-red macules) in the eyes, and sometimes additional neurological findings. Sialidosis type I is caused by genetic changes in the NEU1 gene. Individuals with Sialidosis type I have genetic changes that result in some functional NEU1 enzyme. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
Summary of Siderosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Silicosis: Silicosis is a respiratory disease caused by breathing in (inhaling) silica dust. There are three types of Silicosis: Simple chronic Silicosis may cause people to have difficulty breathing. Swelling of the lungs and other symptoms occur faster in this type of Silicosis than in the simple chronic form. Acute Silicosis results from short-term exposure (weeks or months) of large amounts of silica. The lungs become very inflamed and can fill with fluid, causing severe shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels. A cough, weight loss, and fatigue may also be present. Acute Silicosis progresses rapidly and can be fatal within months. People who work in jobs where they are exposed to silica dust (mining, quarrying, construction, sand blasting, stone cutting) are at risk of developing this condition."
Summary of Simian B virus infection: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome: Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) is a condition that affects many parts of the body and occurs primarily in males. SGBS is an overgrowth disorder, meaning that people with the disease are larger than average at birth (macrosomia) and continue to grow and gain weight at an unusual rate. The severity varies from very mild forms in carrier females to infantile lethal forms in affected males. The infantile lethal form of SGBS is sometimes known as SGBS type 2. People with SGBS typically have distinctive facial features, including a large distance between the eyes (hypertelorism), an unusually wide mouth (macrostomia) with a large tongue (macroglossia), and abnormalities of the roof of the mouth (palate). Other, findings include extra nipples, various birth defects such as a protrusion of the lining of the abdomen through the area around the belly button (umbilical hernia), and skeletal anomalies. Some people with the condition have a mild to severe intellectual disability. About 10 percent of people with SGBS develop tumors in early childhood, including a rare type of kidney cancer (Wilms tumor) and cancer of the nerve tissue (neuroblastoma). SGBS can be caused by genetic changes in the GPC3 and GPC4 genes. Genetic changes in other genes have been studied, but have in most instances have only been described in one person or one family. In other cases, the cause is unknown. SGBS is inherited in an X-linked manner."
Summary of Sinus cancer: A carcinoma arising from the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses.
"Summary of Sirenomelia: Sirenomelia is a birth defect in which affected infants are born with a single lower extremity or with two legs that are fused together. The symptoms and physical findings associated with the condition vary greatly among affected individuals and may include malformations of the spine and skeletal system (commonly with vertebrae either absent or defective); absent or underdeveloped internal and external sex organs, rectum, kidneys and/or bladder; closed rectal opening (imperforate anus); and other abnormalities of the lower gastrointestinal tract. The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to result from irregularities in early development of the blood circulating system within the embryo. Surgery has been successful in separating joined legs."
"Summary of Sitosterolemia: Sitosterolemia is a rare inherited condition in which plant sterols accumulate in the blood and tissues. Plant sterols, including sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol, are fatty substances found in vegetable oils and nuts. Individuals with Sitosterolemia have extremely high levels of sitosterol (30 to 100 times higher than normal), along with mildly to moderately elevated levels of cholesterol in their blood. These plant sterols and cholesterol build up in the arteries, leading to premature thickening of the artery walls and early heart disease. Affected individuals may also develop small yellowish growths called xanthomas on or under the skin and in the tendons. Sitosterolemia is caused by genetic changes in the ABCG5 or ABCG8 gene. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Sjögren-Larsson syndrome: Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an inborn error of lipid metabolism, characterized by congenital ichthyosis (dry, scaly skin), intellectual disability, and spasticity (stiffness and involuntary muscle spasms). The syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the gene called FADH (fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase) and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Sneddon syndrome: Sneddon syndrome is a rare, progressive condition that affects blood vessels. It is primarily characterized by livedo reticularis (net-like patterns of discoloration on the skin) and neurological abnormalities. Symptoms may include transient ischemic attacks (mini-strokes) and strokes; headache; dizziness; high blood pressure; and heart disease. Reduced blood flow to the brain may cause reduced intellectual ability, memory loss, personality changes, and/or other neurological symptoms. The cause of Sneddon syndrome is often unknown, but it is sometimes associated with an autoimmune disease. Most cases are sporadic but some familial cases with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported."
"Summary of Spasmodic dysphonia: Spasmodic dysphonia is a disease caused by involuntary movements of one or more muscles of the voice box (larynx). Signs and symptoms may range from occasional difficulty saying a word or two to substantial difficulty speaking that interferes with communication. Spasmodic dysphonia causes the voice to have a tight, strained, or strangled quality. The cause of Spasmodic dysphonia is unknown. Some cases of Spasmodic dysphonia occur along with other diseases that affect the nervous system such as movement disorders. Spasmodic dysphonia may be inherited, or it may occur after a trauma to the voice box such as an injury or a severe cold. Diagnosis of Spasmodic dysphonia is based on an exam by a multidisciplinary team, including an otolaryngologist. This exam may include a videolaryngostroboscopy."
Summary of Sphingolipidosis: A group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by the intralysosomal accumulation of SPHINGOLIPIDS primarily in the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM and to a variable degree in the visceral organs. They are classified by the enzyme defect in the degradation pathway and the substrate accumulation (or storage). Clinical features vary in subtypes but neurodegeneration is a common sign.
"Summary of Isolated spina bifida: Spina bifida is a type of neural tube defect in which the neural tube (the structure in an embryo that becomes the brain and spinal cord) does not completely close during development in the womb. This may result in part of the spinal cord sticking out through an opening in the spine, leading to permanent nerve damage. Babies born with Spina bifida often have a fluid-filled sac, covered by skin, on their back. This is called a meningocele. If the sac contains part of the spinal cord and its protective covering, it is known as a myelomeningocele. The signs and symptoms of Spina bifida can range from mild to severe, depending on the location and extent of spinal cord involvement. Possible symptoms include include a loss of feeling below the level of the opening, weakness or paralysis of the feet or legs, problems with bladder and bowel control, hydrocephalus, and learning problems. The cause in most cases is multifactorial, which means that both genetic and environmental factors interact to cause Spina bifida. Some cases may be due to the inheritance of specific genetic changes, chromosome abnormalities, or fetal exposure to teratogens. Maternal folate deficiency increases the risk to have a baby with Spina bifida, and women who take folic acid supplements before and during early pregnancy are much less likely to have a baby with Spina bifida. There is also a milder form of the condition called Spina bifida occulta in which the nerves develop normally and health problems rarely occur."
"Summary of Spinal muscular atrophy: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of genetic neuromuscular disorders that affect the nerve cells that control voluntary muscles (motor neurons). The loss of motor neurons causes progressive muscle weakness and loss of movement due to muscle wasting (atrophy). Many types of SMA mainly affect the muscles involved in walking, sitting, arm movement, and head control. Breathing and swallowing may also become difficult as the disease progresses in many types of SMA. In some types of SMA, the loss of motor neurons makes it hard to control movement of the hands and feet. SMA type 1, 2, 3, and 4 are caused by changes (pathogenic variants, also know as genetic changes) in the SMN1 gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Extra copies of the nearby related gene, SMN2, modify the severity of SMA. There are other rarer types of SMA caused by changes in different genes. Other autosomal recessive forms include SMA with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME) caused by changes in the ASAH1 gene and SMA with respiratory distress 1 (SMARD1) caused by changes in the IGHMBP2 gene. X-linked forms include X-linked infantile SMA caused by changes in UBA1. Diagnosis of SMA is suspected by symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing."

Summary of Splenomegaly: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia: Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) is a group of rare genetic conditions that affect bone growth in the spine, arms, and legs. Other features include problems with vision and hearing, clubfeet, cleft palate, arthritis, and difficulty with breathing as curvature of the spine progresses. There are two main types of SED, Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (which is present from birth) and Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (which develops later in childhood or adolescence). Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is caused by genetic changes in genes that are responsible for making proteins that are needed for the creation of bone and cartilage. Most cases are due to a new (de novo) genetic change, although it can be passed down through families."
"Summary of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome: Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) is a type of prion disease. Prion diseases are a group of conditions that affect the nervous system. The main feature of GSS is a progressive degeneration of the cerebellum (a part of the brain that controls coordination, balance, equilibrium and muscle tone), as well as different degrees of dementia. It is caused by changes in the PRNP gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Sporotrichosis: Sporotrichosis is an infection caused by the dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii, generally occurring by traumatic inoculation of fungus from contaminated soil, plants, and organic matter, that has a highly variable disease spectrum but that usually presents as a subcutaneous mycosis with a single sporotrichotic chancre that may ulcerate and can then progress to lymphocutaneous (most common form; sporotrichotic chancre at inoculation site and a string of similar nodules along the proximal lymphatics), fixed cutaneous (localized asymptomatic, erythematous, papules at the inoculation site), or multifocal or disseminated cutaneous (rare form, with 3 or more lesions involving 2 different anatomical sites) forms. Pulmonary sporotrichosis occurs following inhalation of fungus and manifests as chronic pneumonitis while extracutaneous or systemic sporotrichosis (with osteoarticular, pulmonary, and central nervous system/meningeal disease) has also been reported, usually occurring in the setting of immunosuppression."
"Summary of Sprengel deformity: Sprengel deformity is a congenital condition characterized by abnormal development and elevation of the shoulder blade (scapula). Severity can range considerably from being almost invisible when covered with clothes, to the shoulder being elevated over 5 centimeters, with neck webbing. Signs and symptoms may include a lump in the back of the base of the neck and limited movement in the shoulder or arm. The condition may also be associated with other skeletal (bone or cartilage) or muscular abnormalities. Sprengel deformity typically occurs sporadically for no apparent reason but autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported. It is caused by an interruption of normal development and movement of the scapula during early fetal growth (probably between the 9th and 12th weeks of gestation)."
Summary of Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency: Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is a disorder that can cause a variety of neurological and neuromuscular problems. The signs and symptoms can be extremely variable among affected individuals and may include mild to severe intellectual disability; developmental delay (especially involving speech); hypotonia; difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia); and/or seizures. Some affected individuals may also have decreased reflexes (hyporeflexia); nystagmus; hyperactivity; and/or behavioral problems. SSADH deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the ALDH5A1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
"Summary of Stevens-Johnson syndrome: Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a very severe reaction, most commonly triggered by medications, that causes skin tissue to die (necrosis) and detach. The mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth, and/or genitals are also commonly affected. SJS and TEN previously were thought to be separate conditions, but they are now considered part of a disease spectrum. SJS is at the less severe end of the spectrum, and TEN is at the more severe end. It is considered SJS when skin detachment involves less than 10% of the body surface, and TEN when skin detachment involves more than 30% of the body surface. People with skin detachment involving 10-30% of the body surface are said to have ""SJS/TEN overlap."" All forms of SJS/TEN are a medical emergency that can be life-threatening. The first symptoms of SJS/TEN often include fever and flu-like symptoms (such as general ill feeling, body aches, and cough). Within about 1 to 3 days, a red or purplish rash forms, and then the skin begins to blister and peel, leading to ""raw"" areas of skin that are painful. This often starts on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body. The mucous membranes may also become involved during this time, which can lead to symptoms such as severe conjunctivitis (when the eyes are affected), trouble swallowing and breathing (when the mouth and airway are affected), and difficulty urinating and genital pain (when the genitals are affected). SJS/TEN often is triggered by certain medications including allopurinol, anti-epileptics, pain relievers, cancer therapies, or antibiotics (sometimes up to 2 weeks after stopping the medication). SJS/TEN can also be triggered by infections such as pneumonia, herpes virus, and hepatitis A. In many cases the cause cannot be identified. People that may be at increased risk to develop SJS/TEN include those with HIV, a weakened immune system, a personal or family history of the condition, and certain variations of a gene called HLA-B. There are no universal diagnostic criteria for SJS/TEN. Currently the diagnosis is based on the person's medical history and symptoms. People suspected of having SJS/TEN should be admitted to the hospital to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity."
"Summary of Stomach cancer: ""Stomach cancer, also called gastric cancer, is a form of cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in the stomach. Most people with early Stomach cancer have no signs or symptoms of the condition. In advanced stages, symptoms may include indigestion; nausea and vomiting; difficulty swallowing; feeling full after eating small amounts of food; loss of appetite; vomiting blood; fatigue; and/or weight loss. Most cases of Stomach cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition; however, approximately 10% of Stomach cancers are considered """"familial."""" Although the underlying cause of some familial cases is unknown, genetic changes are identified in a subset of people affected by Stomach cancer. Hereditary cancer syndromes associated with a predisposition to Stomach cancer include hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. In other families, a cluster of Stomach cancers may be due to a combination of gene(s) and/or other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle."""
"Summary of Sturge-Weber syndrome: Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare disorder affecting the skin and nervous system. Babies with SWS are born with a birthmark on their face known as a port-wine stain. Port-wine birthmarks are caused by enlarged blood vessels right underneath the skin. People with Sturge-Weber syndrome also have clusters of abnormal blood vessels between the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spine known as leptomeningeal angiomas. They may also have increased pressure in the eyes known as glaucoma. Other symptoms of SWS may include seizures, muscle weakness, developmental and intellectual disability. SWS is caused by a genetic change in the GNAQ gene. The genetic change is not inherited, but occurs by chance in cells of the developing embryo. SWS is diagnosed based on the symptoms. Imaging studies, such as an MRI or CT-scan, are also used to aid in the diagnosis."
"Summary of Subacute sclerosing leukoencephalitis: Subacute sclerosing leukoencephalitis a rare condition that is caused by a measles infection acquired earlier in life. Affected people may initially experience behavioral changes, dementia, and disturbances in motor function. Ultimately, many people with Subacute sclerosing leukoencephalitis succumb to fever, heart failure, or the brain's inability to continue controlling the autonomic nervous system. It is unclear why some people develop Subacute sclerosing leukoencephalitis after they have seemingly recovered from the measles while others do not."
"Summary of Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency: Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) is a genetic condition that affects a person's ability to digest certain sugars. People with this condition cannot break down the sugars sucrose (a sugar found in fruits, and also known as table sugar) and maltose (the sugar found in grains). CSID usually becomes apparent after an infant begins to consume fruits, juices, and grains. After ingestion of sucrose or maltose, an affected child will typically experience stomach cramps, bloating, excess gas production, and diarrhea. These digestive problems can lead to failure to thrive and malnutrition. Most affected children are better able to tolerate sucrose and maltose as they get older. CSID is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by genetic changes in the SI gene."
"Summary of Sudden infant death syndrome: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexpected, sudden death of a child under age 1 which cannot be explained after a thorough investigation is conducted. Infants who are affected by the condition generally appear healthy with no suspicious signs and symptoms prior to the incident. It is the leading cause of death in infants age 1 to 12 months old. The exact underlying cause of SIDS is unknown; however, scientists suspect that it is likely a multifactorial condition (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors). Although there is no guaranteed way to prevent SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics has a published list of recommendations for risk reduction."
"Summary of Superior mesenteric artery syndrome: Superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS) is a digestive condition that occurs when the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) is compressed between two arteries (the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery). This compression causes partial or complete blockage of the duodenum. Symptoms vary based on severity, but can be severely debilitating. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, fullness, nausea, vomiting, and/or weight loss. SMAS typically is due to loss of the mesenteric fat pad (fatty tissue that surrounds the superior mesenteric artery). The most common cause is significant weight loss caused by medical disorders, psychological disorders, or surgery. In younger patients, it most commonly occurs after corrective spinal surgery for scoliosis. Delays in diagnosis may result in significant complications."
"Summary of Susac syndrome: Susac syndrome is an autoimmune condition that affects the very small blood vessels in the brain, retina, and inner ear (cochlea). The condition is characterized by three main symptoms: brain disease (encephalopathy), hearing loss, and vision loss. Some people may not have all signs of Susac syndrome, but instead develop only specific combinations of the symptoms. Susac syndrome affects women more than men. The cause of Susac syndrome is still unknown. Diagnosis is based on a clinical exam and imaging tests to look for the specific signs of Susac syndrome."
Summary of Sutton disease 2: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Sydenham chorea: Sydenham's chorea is a neurological disorder characterized by rapid, jerky, irregular, and involuntary movements (chorea), especially of the face and limbs. Additional symptoms may include muscle weakness, slurred speech, headaches, and seizures. Children with Sydenham's chorea often have emotional or behavioral problems such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, distractibility, irritability, and inappropriate outbursts of laughing or crying. Sydenham's chorea mostly affects children and adolescents and usually follows a Streptococcal infection by anywhere form 1-8 months. Sydenham's chorea is one of the major clinical signs of acute rheumatic fever. The uncontrolled movements are often worse during periods of stress, fatigue, or excitement. In some cases, only one side of the body is affected. Sydenham's chorea usually resolves within 3 weeks to 3 months. However, symptoms may last longer in some cases."
"Summary of Synovial chondromatosis, familial with dwarfism: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Synovial sarcoma: Synovial sarcoma is a rare and aggressive soft tissue sarcoma. However, as the tumor grows larger, affected people may notice a lump or swelling. In some cases, the tumor can limit range of motion or cause numbness and/or pain if it presses on nearby nerves. Although Synovial sarcoma does not have a clearly defined cause, genetic factors are believed to influence the development of this disease. Cells in these tumors are usually characterized by the presence of a translocation involving chromosomes X and 18. This translocation is specific to Synovial sarcoma and is often used to diagnose the condition."
Summary of Synovitis: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Syringobulbia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Syringomyelia: Syringomyelia is a condition in which a cyst, called a syrinx, forms within the spinal cord. This cyst expands and elongates over time, destroying the center of the spinal cord which can result in pain, weakness, stiffness in the back, shoulders, arms, or legs, headaches, and insensitivity to temperature (especially in the hands). Symptoms vary from person to person. Syringomyelia is often related to a congenital abnormality of the brain called a Chiari I malformation, but may also occur as a complication of trauma, inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) such as the inflammation of the arachnoides (arachnoiditis), hemorrhage, or a tumor. Some cases of Syringomyelia are familial, although this is rare."
"Summary of Takayasu arteritis: Takayasu arteritis is a condition that causes inflammation of the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (aorta) and its associated branched blood vessels. As a result of the inflammation, the blood vessel walls become thick and make it difficult for blood to flow. Over time, impaired blood flow causes damage to the heart and various other organs of the body. Although the cause remains unknown, Takayasu arteritis appears to be an autoimmune condition, in which cells that fight infection and disease are wrongly targeted against the body's own tissues."
"Summary of Tangier disease: Tangier disease is an inherited disorder characterized by significantly reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) - the 'good cholesterol' - in the blood. Because people with Tangier disease have very low levels of HDL, they have a moderately increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Tangier disease is caused by genetic changes in the ABCA1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
Summary of Tardive dyskinesia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Tarsal tunnel syndrome: Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a nerve disorder that is characterized by pain in the ankle, foot, and toes. This condition is caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve, which runs through a canal near the heel into the sole of the foot. When tissues around this nerve become inflamed, they can press on the nerve and cause the pain associated with Tarsal tunnel syndrome."
"Summary of Tay-Sachs disease: Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disease. People with Tay-Sachs disease do not have enough of an enzyme called beta-hexosaminidase A. The less enzyme a person has, the more severe the disease and the earlier that symptoms appear. Infantile - the most common severe form, with symptoms appearing in the first few months of life. Symptoms include a loss of skills learned (regression), seizures, and loss of muscle and mental functions. Symptoms include behavior problems, gradual loss of skills, frequent respiratory infections, and seizures. Symptoms may include clumsiness, muscle weakness, psychiatric disorders, and gradual loss of skills, often leading to the need for mobility assistance. Intellect and behavior become impaired in some cases. The lifespan varies from shortened to unaffected. Tay-Sachs disease is caused by genetic changes in the HEXA gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. The HEXA gene gives the body instructions to make part of the beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme, which is needed to break down a substance called GM2 ganglioside. When the enzyme is not functional or not made, GM2 ganglioside builds up in the nerve cells (neurons) of the brain and spinal cord, causing the symptoms of the disease. The diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease involves a blood test that detects absent or very low levels of beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme activity. Molecular genetic testing of the HEXA gene may be used to identify the specific genetic changes present, or to rule out the disease if a false-positive blood test result is suspected."
Summary of Malignant Teratocarcinosarcoma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Hyperphenylalaninemia due to tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency: Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency causes the body to build up an abnormally high level of phenylalanine, one of the building blocks of proteins. In addition, BH4 deficiency leads to low levels of certain neurotransmitters, chemical messengers that control many body functions. Symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Babies with BH4 deficiency appear normal at birth but may develop neurological symptoms such as abnormal muscle tone, poor head control, seizures, and delayed motor development. BH4 deficiency is caused by pathogenic variants in any one of several genes including the GCH1, PCBD1, PTS, and QDPR genes. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and blood and urine tests. BH4 deficiency is sometimes diagnosed based on the results of an abnormal newborn screening test."
"Summary of Tetrasomy X: Tetrasomy X is a chromosome disorder that only affects females and is caused by having four copies of the X chromosome instead of two. Females with Tetrasomy X have a total of 48 chromosomes in their cells, so this condition is sometimes written as 48, XXXX. The signs and symptoms of Tetrasomy X vary, but can include mild to moderate speech and learning difficulties; developmental delay; distinctive facial features; dental abnormalities; hypotonia and joint laxity; radioulnar synostosis; heart defects; hip dysplasia; and problems with ovarian function. An increased risk of childhood infections has also been reported. Tetrasomy X is caused by a random error that occurs during the development of an egg cell and is not caused by anything a mother does during her pregnancy."
"Summary of Thalassemia: Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that reduces the production of functional hemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen). There are two main types of Thalassemia, alpha Thalassemia and beta Thalassemia. Signs and symptoms vary but may include mild to severe anemia, paleness, fatigue, yellow discoloration of skin (jaundice), and bone problems. Beta Thalassemia is caused by changes in the HBB gene while alpha Thalassemia is caused by genetic changes in the HBA1 and/or HBA2 genes. Both are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Thoracic outlet syndrome: Thoracic outlet syndromes (TOSs) are a group of disorders with one common feature: the compression of 1 or more of the nerves and/or blood vessels just above the first rib and behind the collarbone. There are 4 recognized subtypes of TOS, each with a distinct cause and pattern of symptoms. Arterial TOS (A-TOS) - due to compression of the subclavian artery, most commonly caused by a cervical rib. Symptoms may include blood clots, arm pain with exertion, or acute arterial thrombosis (sudden blood flow obstruction in an artery). Venous TOS (V-TOS) - due to compression of the subclavian vein, often associated with repetitive arm activities. It may cause pain, swelling, and deep vein thrombosis. Traumatic neurovascular TOS - occurs after trauma to the collarbone and may affect both nerves and vessels. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, bruising, weakness, and loss of sensation in the arm and hand. True neurogenic TOS (TN-TOS) - caused by compression of the brachial plexus. Symptoms include numbness, abnormal sensations, and weakness of the arms and shoulders, as well as pain in the neck, shoulder or hand."
Summary of Thrombasthenia: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Tick paralysis: Paralysis caused by a neurotropic toxin secreted by the salivary glands of ticks.
"Summary of Tietz syndrome: Tietz syndrome is a rare condition characterized by hearing loss, fair skin, and light-colored hair. The hearing loss in affected individuals is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) and is present from birth. People with Tietz syndrome are born with white hair and very pale skin but their hair color often darkens over time; The colored part of the eye (the iris) is blue. It is caused by changes in the MITF gene which affects the development of melanocytes. The inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Togaviridae disease: A viral infection caused by any of the arboviruses of the Togaviridae family. It is transmitted by arthropods. Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, rash, confusion, and seizures."
"Summary of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome: Tolosa Hunt syndrome (THS) is a rare condition characterized by painful ophthalmoplegia (paralysis and/or weakness of the eye muscles). Signs and symptoms include a constant pain behind the eye; decreased eye movements; and signs of cranial nerve paralysis such as drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), double vision (diplopia), large pupil, and facial numbness. Although it is considered a benign condition, permanent neurologic deficits can occur and relapses are common. The features of THS are caused by inflammation of the cavernous sinus (an area at the base of the brain) but the underlying cause of the inflammation is unknown."
Summary of Tongue cancer: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of TORCH syndrome: A syndrome that results from a group of infections that affect the fetus or the newborn. The group of infections includes Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and other infections. The other infections include varicella-zoster virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, parvovirus B19, and syphilis. Signs and symptoms include fever, feeding difficulties, petechial rash, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, chorioretinitis, and microcephaly."
"Summary of Tourette syndrome: Tourette syndrome is a complex neurological disorder that is characterized by repetitive, sudden, uncontrolled (involuntary) movements and sounds (vocalizations) called tics. Tourette syndrome is named for Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described this disorder in 1885. A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing Tourette syndrome. A small number of people with Tourette syndrome have been found to have genetic changes involving the SLITRK1 gene. The syndrome is believed to be linked to problems in certain areas of the brain, and the chemical substances (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) that help nerve cells talk to one another. It is estimated that about 1% of the population has Tourette syndrome. Many people with very mild tics may not be aware of them and never seek medical help. Tourette syndrome is four times as likely to occur in boys as in girls. Although Tourette syndrome can be a chronic condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime, most people with the condition experience their worst symptoms in their early teens, with improvement occurring in the late teens and continuing into adulthood."
"Summary of Townes-Brocks syndrome: Townes-Brocks syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by an obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus), abnormally shaped ears, and thumb malformations. Most affected individuals have at least two of these three main features. Other signs and symptoms may include kidney abnormalities, hearing loss, heart defects, genital malformations and intellectual disability. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the SALL1 gene which provides instructions for making proteins that are involved in the formation of tissues and organs before birth. In rare cases, the syndrome may be caused by a genetic change in the SALL4 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Imperforate anus is corrected with surgery as soon as possible, after the baby is born."
"Summary of Tracheobronchomalacia: Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a rare condition that occurs when the walls of the airway (specifically the trachea and bronchi) are weak. This can cause the airway to become narrow or collapse. There are two forms of TBM. One typically develops during infancy or early childhood (primary TBM). The other is an acquired form usually seen in adults (acquired or secondary TBM). Some people with TBM may initially have no signs or symptoms. Most cases of primary TBM are caused by genetic conditions that weaken the walls of the airway, while the acquired form may occur due to trauma, chronic inflammation, and/or prolonged compression of the airways. The acquired form is often seen in adults with common respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. In many cases, the cause is not known."
"Summary of Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood: A rare, benign, red cell aplasia of young children or infants characterized by a normocytic normochromic anaemia with severe reticulocytopenia in otherwise normocellular bone marrow, and a complete spontaneous recovery within 1-2 months after diagnosis. Neutropenia and thrombocytosis may be associated findings at diagnosis, and a history of a preceding viral illness is frequent. No organomegaly is observed."
"Summary of Transitional cell carcinoma: A malignant neoplasm arising from the transitional epithelium, usually affecting the urinary bladder, ureter, or renal pelvis. It may or may not have a papillary configuration. It is graded 1 to 3 or 4 according to the degree of cellular differentiation and architectural patterns. Grade 1 transitional cell carcinoma is histologically benign but it may recur. Transitional cell carcinomas may also affect the upper respiratory tract and the ovaries."
"Summary of Transposition of the great arteries: Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a type of congenital heart defect in which there is a reversal of the normal connections of the aorta and the pulmonary artery with the heart. The aorta and pulmonary artery are reversed, which causes oxygen-poor blood to be circulated to the body and oxygen-rich blood to be circulated between the lungs and the heart, rather than to the body. Symptoms are apparent at birth and include great difficulty breathing and severe cyanosis (a bluish discoloration of the skin). The exact cause of TGA in most cases is unknown. Surgery is done to correct the abnormality during the first few days of life."
"Summary of Transverse myelitis: Transverse myelitis is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation of the spinal cord, which carries nerve signals from the brain to the rest of the body. The segment of the spinal cord that has inflammation or damage determines the symptoms a person has. Generally, inflammation at one segment causes symptoms at that level and below that level. Most commonly, the upper spinal cord is affected, causing impaired leg movement, and problems controlling the bowel and bladder. The cause of Transverse myelitis may be unknown (idiopathic) or it may be associated with a wide variety of underlying health problems, including infections, immune system disorders, and other inflammatory disorders. Tests that may be used to diagnose Transverse myelitis include MRI to look for compression or inflammation of the spinal cord, and a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to look for evidence of inflammation in the fluid surrounding the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid)."
Summary of Treponema infection: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome: Tricho-dento-osseous dysplasia (TDO) belongs to the ectodermal dysplasias and is characterised by curly/kinky hair at birth, enamel hypoplasia with discolouration and molar taurodontism, increased overall bone mineral density (BMD) and increased thickness of the cortical bones of the skull."
"Summary of Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome, type i: Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 (TRPS1) is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder. TRPS1 is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance that includes sparse scalp hair; a rounded nose; a long, flat area between the nose and the upper lip (philtrum); and a thin upper lip. Individuals with this condition also have skeletal abnormalities such as cone-shaped epiphyses in their fingers and toes and short stature. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. Transmission of TRPS1 is autosomal dominant, linked to genetic changes in the TRPS1 gene localized to 8q24.12."
"Summary of Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 2: Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 2 (TRPS2), also known as Langer-Giedion syndrome, is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder. The condition is characterized by intellectual deficit and numerous other abnormalities including excess folds of skin, multiple bony growths (exostoses), characteristic facial features, and cone-shaped phalangeal epiphyses (the growing ends of the bones in the fingers). The range and severity of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. TRPS2 is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, but many sporadic cases have been reported. TRPS2 is due to the absence of genetic material (chromosomal deletions) on chromosome 8, which often includes the TRPS1 gene and EXT1 gene. The size of the deletion varies from person to person."
"Summary of Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome, type iii: Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 3 (TRPS3), also known as Sugio-Kajii syndrome, is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder. TRPS3 is characterized by short stature, sparse hair, a bulbous nasal tip and cone-shaped epiphyses (the growing ends of bones), as well as severe generalized shortening of all finger and toe bones (brachydactyly). The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. TRPS3 is caused by genetic changes in the TRPS1 gene which is localized to 8q24.12. TRPS3 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Trichotillomania: Trichotillomania is a disorder characterized by an overwhelming urge to repeatedly pull out one's own hair, resulting in hair loss (alopecia). It is classified under the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders category. Trichotillomania results in highly variable patterns of hair loss. The scalp is the most common area of hair pulling, followed by the eyebrows, eyelashes, pubic and perirectal areas, axillae, limbs, torso, and face. The resulting alopecia can range from thin unnoticeable areas of hair loss to total baldness. Some people chew or swallow the hair they pull out (trichophagy), which can result in gastrointestinal problems or develop a trichobezoar (hairball in the intestines or stomach). In many cases, people with this disorder feel extreme tension when they feel an impulse, followed by relief, gratification or pleasure afterwards. The disorder may be mild and manageable, or severe and debilitating. The cause is unknown, though both environmental and genetic causes have been suspected."
"Summary of Trigeminal neuralgia: Trigeminal neuralgia is a nerve disorder that causes a stabbing or electric-shock-like pain in parts of the face. The pain lasts a few seconds to a few minutes, and usually on only one side of the face. It can also cause muscle spasms in the face the same time as the pain. The pain may result from a blood vessel pressing against the trigeminal nerve (the nerve that carries pain, feeling, and other sensations from the brain to the skin of the face), as a complication of multiple sclerosis, or due to compression of the nerve by a tumor or cyst. In some cases, the cause is unknown."

Summary of Chromosome 9q duplication: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Tropical sprue: A chronic malabsorption syndrome, occurring mainly in residents of or visitors to the tropics or subtropics. The failed INTESTINAL ABSORPTION of nutrients from the SMALL INTESTINE results in MALNUTRITION and ANEMIA that is due to FOLIC ACID deficiency."
"Summary of African trypanosomiasis: Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also called sleeping sickness, is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by a protozoa of the Trypanosoma genus transmitted by the bite of a tsetse fly (genus Glossina), that is found under its chronic form (average duration of 3 years) in western and central Africa (in case of the T. brucei gambiense sub-species), and under its acute form (lasting from few weeks to 6 months) in eastern and southern Africa (in case of the T. brucei rhodesiense sub-species). HAT comprises an initial hemo-lymphatic stage characterized by fever, weakness, musculoskeletal pain, anemia, and lymphadenopathy, along with dermatologic, cardiac and endocrine complications or hepatosplenomegaly, followed by a meningo-encephalitic stage characterized by neurologic involvement (sleep disturbances, psychiatric disorders, seizures) that progresses, in the absence of treatment, towards a fatal meningoencephalitis."
Summary of Tuberculous meningitis: A bacterial infection of the membranes covering the brain and the spinal cord caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Summary of Tuberculous uveitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Tuberous sclerosis complex: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is characterized by the growth of benign tumors throughout the body, including in the heart, brain, and kidneys. Certain symptoms develop before to birth, such as heart tumors (rhabdomyoma). Other symptoms become more obvious in childhood, such as developmental delay and skin changes. Lung and kidney tumors are more likely to develop in adulthood. TSC is caused by the TSC1 or TSC2 gene not working correctly. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This condition is diagnosed based on a clinical exam, medical tests such as imaging studies, and genetic testing."
"Summary of Turner syndrome: Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that affects development in females. It results when a female's cells have one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is either missing or structurally altered (females without Turner syndrome have two normal X chromosomes in each cell, and males have one X and one Y chromosome). Signs and symptoms may include short stature, premature ovarian failure, a ""webbed"" neck, a low hairline at the back of the neck, and swelling (lymphedema) of the hands and feet. Some people with Turner syndrome have skeletal abnormalities, kidney problems, and/or a congenital heart defect. Most affected girls and women have normal intelligence, but some have developmental delays, learning disabilities, and/or behavior problems. Turner syndrome is typically not inherited, but it can be inherited in rare cases."
"Summary of Typhus: group of acute, arthropod borne infections caused by rickettsiae; includes epidemic (classic or louse-borne) typhus, its recrudescent form, and murine (endemic or flea-borne) typhus; all are characterized by severe headache, chills, high fever, stupor, and rash."
"Summary of Urachal cancer: Urachal cancer is a are type of bladder cancers. The urachus is a structure normally only present during development in the womb that connects the bellybutton and the bladder. This connection normally disappears before birth, but in some people remains. Urachal cancers are usually diagnosed in adults in their 50's and 60's and may develop at the dome or anterior wall of the bladder, along the midline of the body (including the belly button), and between the pubis symphasis and the bladder. Most Urachal cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that develop from gland cells). Others may be sarcomas (which develop from connective tissue - such as leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma), small cell carcinomas, transitional cell cancer, and mixed neoplasias. Most individuals with Urachal cancer have symptoms of with hematuria (blood in urine). Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, mucinuria, and bacteriuria."
"Summary of Disorder of urea cycle metabolism and ammonia detoxification: Disorder of urea cycle metabolism and ammonia detoxification is a genetic disorder that results in a deficiency of one of the six enzymes in the urea cycle. These enzymes are responsible for removing ammonia from the blood stream. The urea cycle involves a series of biochemical steps in which nitrogen, a waste product of protein metabolism, is changed to a compound called urea and removed from the blood. Normally, the urea is removed from the body through the urine. In Disorder of urea cycle metabolism and ammonia detoxification, nitrogen builds up in the blood in the form of ammonia, a highly toxic substance, resulting in hyperammonemia (elevated blood ammonia). Ammonia then reaches the brain through the blood, where it can cause irreversible brain damage, coma and/or death. The severity correlates with the amount of urea cycle enzyme function."
"Summary of Cutaneous mastocytosis: Cutaneous mastocytosis is a form of mastocytosis that primarily affects the skin. There are three main forms of the condition: maculopapular Cutaneous mastocytosis (also called urticaria pigmentosa), solitary cutaneous mastocytoma, and diffuse Cutaneous mastocytosis. There is also an exteremely rare form called telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans. The signs, symptoms and severity of the condition vary by subtype. Cutaneous mastocytosis is usually caused by changes in the KIT gene. Most cases are caused by somatic genetic changes which are not inherited or passed on to the next generation. However, it can rarely affect more than one family member and be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Usher syndrome: Usher syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss or deafness and progressive vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa. Sensorineural hearing means it is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear. Retinitis pigmentosa is an eye disease that affects the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Night vision loss begins first, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision, that can enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision (loss of all peripheral vision). In some cases, vision is further impaired by clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). Three major types of Usher syndrome have been described - types I, II, and III. The different types are distinguished by their severity and the age when signs and symptoms appear. All three types are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Valinemia: Valinemia is a very rare metabolic disorder characterized by abnormally high levels of the amino acid valine in the blood and urine. Infants with Valinemia reportedly experience lack of appetite, vomiting, and failure to thrive. In some cases, the condition may be life-threatening. Low muscle tone (hypotonia), excessive drowsiness, hyperactivity, and developmental delay have also been reported. Valinemia is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme valine transaminase, which is needed for the breakdown (metabolism) of valine in the body. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, although the gene responsible for the condition is not yet known."
"Summary of Van der woude syndrome 2: Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is a dominantly inherited developmental disorder characterized by pits and/or sinuses of the lower lip, and cleft lip and/or cleft palate (CL/P, CP). It is the most common cleft syndrome.For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of van der Woude syndrome, see VWS1 (119300)."
"Summary of Porphyria variegata: Variegate porphyria (VP) causes the abnormal production of heme, an important part of the protein in blood that carries oxygen throughout our bodies. It is used in all the body's organs. Symptoms of VP usually begin in adulthood and are different from person to person. Symptoms may include sun sensitivity and the development of skin blisters and sores when exposed to sunlight. Some people with VP have episodes (acute attacks) of severe stomach pain, nausea and vomiting. In some cases, muscle weakness, anxiety, and seizures may occur. Variegate porphyria is caused by genetic changes in the PPOX gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Some people who have PPOX gene variants never have symptoms of porphyria. Diagnosis of VP is based on the symptoms, clinical examination, and other blood and urine tests. The diagnosis may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis: Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (Hypersensitivity vasculitis) is an extreme reaction to a drug, infection, or foreign substance that leads to inflammation and damage to blood vessels of the skin. Signs and symptoms may include purple-colored spots and patches on the skin; skin lesions on the legs, buttocks, or trunk; blisters on the skin; hives (urticaria); and/or open sores with dead tissue (necrotic ulcers). This condition is caused by an allergic reaction to a drug or other foreign substance. This condition usually goes away over time; but on occasion, people can have repeated episodes."
Summary of Ventricular septal defects: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Vernal keratoconjunctivitis: Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a chronic, severe allergy that affects the surfaces of the eyes. It most commonly occurs in boys living in warm, dry climates. Attacks associated with VKC are common in the spring (hence the name ""vernal"") and summer but often reoccur in the winter. It is caused by a hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to airborne-allergens."
Summary of Von Hippel-Lindau disease: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited disorder characterized by the abnormal growth of both benign and cancerous tumors and cysts in many parts of the body. Tumors usually first appear in young adulthood. The types of tumors associated with VHL disease include hemangioblastomas (slow-growing tumors of the central nervous system); kidney cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma; pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors; pheochromocytomas (noncancerous tumors of the adrenal glands); and endolymphatic sac tumors. VHL disease is caused by a genetic change in the VHL gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
"Summary of Hemophagocytic syndrome associated with an infection: Virus associated hemophagocytic syndrome is a very serious complication of a viral infection. Signs and symptoms of Virus associated hemophagocytic syndrome, include high fever, liver problems, enlarged liver and spleen, coagulation factor abnormalities, decreased red or white blood cells and platelets (pancytopenia), and a build-up of histiocytes, a type of immune cell, in various tissues in the body resulting in the destruction of blood-producing cells (histiocytic proliferation with prominent hemophagocytosis). Diagnosis is based upon the signs and symptoms of the patient. The cause of the condition is not known."
"Summary of Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism: Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) is an inherited condition that causes short stature, round face, and short hand bones. PPHP causes joints and other soft tissues in the body to harden. It also affects how bones are formed. As a result, PPHP can cause bone, joint, and nerve damage, and this damage can cause lasting pain. Some people with PPHP (10%) also have learning disability. PHPP is caused by genetic changes in the GNAS gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. This condition is usually inherited from the father (genomic imprinting). PPHP is genetically related to pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (PHP-1a). Signs and symptoms are similar, however people with PPHP do not show resistance to parathyroid hormone while people with PHP-1a do. Obesity is characteristic for PHP-1a and may be severe, while obesity is less prominent and may be absent among people with PPHP. Both PHP-1a and PPHP are caused by genetic changes that affect the function of the GNAS gene. But people who inherit the genetic change from their mother develop PHP-1a; whereas those who inherit the genetic change from their father develop PPHP."
"Summary of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH disease) affects the eyes, ears, nervous system, and skin. The symptoms of VKH occur in different phases. The early symptoms include headaches, eye pain, and dizziness. These are followed by hearing loss and inflammation of the eye (panuveitis). Later symptoms include development of white patches of skin and hair (vitiligo), hair loss (alopecia), cataracts, and glaucoma. The exact cause of VKH disease is unknown, but the symptoms are thought to be due to an abnormal response of the immune system to a viral infection. Genetic factors may be involved. Diagnosis of VKH disease is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and imaging studies. Other more common diseases may need to excluded before a diagnosis of VKH disease is made."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency type Ia: Glycogen storage disease due to glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency type Ia is an inherited disorder caused by the buildup of a complex sugar called glycogen in the body's cells. The accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially the liver, kidneys, and small intestines, impairs their ability to function normally. Glycogen storage disease type 1A is characterized by growth retardation leading to short stature and accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver and kidneys. Although some newborns present with severe hypoglycemia, it is more common for infants to present at age three to four months with hepatomegaly, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and/or hypoglycemic seizures. Xanthoma and diarrhea may be present. Impaired platelet function can lead to a bleeding tendency, making epistaxis a frequent problem. Glycogen storage disease due to glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency type Ia is caused by the deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) catalytic activity which results from genetic changes in the G6PC gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Neurofibromatosis type 1: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition that affects the skin, the skeleton and the part of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord peripheral nervous system). The main signs and symptoms of NF1 include dark colored spots on the skin (cafÃ©-au-lait spots), benign growths along the nerves (neurofibromas), and freckles in the underarm and groin. Other symptoms may include colored spots in the eye (Lisch nodules), curvature of the spine, learning disabilities, and an increased risk for cancer. The number of neurofibromas typically increases over time, and some can get large or turn cancerous and need to be removed. The severity and symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. This condition is caused by genetic changes (DNA variants) in the NF1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. NF1 is diagnosed based on a clinical examination, the specific signs and symptoms, and genetic testing."
"Summary of Von Willebrand disease: Von Willebrand disease is a bleeding disorder that slows the blood clotting process. People with this disease often experience bruising, nosebleeds, and prolonged bleeding or oozing following an injury, affer surgery, or having a tooth pulled. Affected women may have heavy menstrual bleeding. In severe cases, heavy bleeding occurs after minor injury or even in the absence of injury. It is divided into three types. Type 1 is the mildest and most common, and type 3 is the most severe and rarest form. Increased age, pregnancy, exercise, and stress may cause von Willebrand factor levels in the blood to rise, which can make bleeding symptoms less frequent. This disease is caused by genetic changes in the VWF gene and can have different inheritance patterns."
"Summary of Wagner disease: Wagner syndrome is a hereditary eye disorder that leads to progressive vision loss. It is characterized by changes to the thick, clear gel that fills the eyeball (the vitrous), in which it becomes thin and watery and appears empty. Signs and symptoms may include: thinning of the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (retinal detachment), abnormalities of the blood vessels within the retina (known as the choroid), and degeneration of the retina and choroid. Wagner syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the VCAN gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Waldenström macroglobulinemia: Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a chronic, slow-growing lymphoproliferative disorder. It usually affects older adults and is primarily found in the bone marrow, although lymph nodes and the spleen may be involved. Affected individuals have a high level of an antibody called immunoglobulin M (IgM) in their blood, which can cause thickening of the blood (hyperviscosity). Although some individuals initially do not have symptoms and are diagnosed from routine blood work, common symptoms may include weakness, appetite loss and weight loss. Other symptoms may include peripheral neuropathy, fever, Raynaud's phenomenon, and mental status changes. Hyperviscosity of the blood may cause nosebleeds, headaches, dizziness, and blurring or loss of vision. The cause of the condition is not known but environmental, genetic, and viral factors have been suggested. There have been some reports of familial cases suggesting a genetic predisposition."
"Summary of Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia: Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia is a digestive disorder in which the lymph vessels supplying the lining of the small intestine are enlarged. The cause of the condition is still unknown. The signs and symptoms include swelling of the legs and abdominal discomfort, loss of lymphatic fluid into the gastrointestinal tract, protein-losing enteropathy, too little albumin in the blood, reduced levels of antibodies, and immunodeficiency."
Summary of Wallerian degeneration: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, warm type: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, warm type (Warm antibody hemolytic anemia) is the most common form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. It is defined by the presence of autoantibodies that attach to and destroy red blood cells at temperatures equal to or greater than normal body temperature. The disease is characterized by symptoms related to anemia, including fatigue, difficulty breathing, jaundice and dark urine. In severe disease, fever, chest pain, syncope or heart failure may occur. Hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells) occurs mainly in the spleen, so mild splenomegaly is relatively common."
"Summary of Watermelon stomach: Watermelon stomach is a condition in which the lining of the stomach bleeds, causing it to look like the characteristic stripes of a watermelon when viewed by endoscopy. Signs and symptoms of Watermelon stomach include blood in the stool, hematemesis (vomiting blood) and anemia. The exact cause of Watermelon stomach is unknown; however, it is often diagnosed in people with other chronic (long-term) conditions such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver and poor liver function), autoimmune disease, systemic sclerosis, and CREST syndrome."
"Summary of Weaver syndrome: Weaver syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized primarily by tall stature. Other signs and symptoms of the condition may include macrocephaly (unusually large head size); intellectual disability; distinctive facial features; camptodactyly (permanently bent digits) of the fingers and/or toes; poor coordination; soft and doughy skin; umbilical hernia; abnormal muscle tone; and a hoarse, low-pitched cry during infancy. Some studies also suggest that people affected by Weaver syndrome may have an increased risk of developing neuroblastoma. Weaver syndrome is usually caused by changes in the EZH2 gene. Although the condition is considered autosomal dominant, most cases occur as de novo genetic changes in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Nodular non-suppurative panniculitis: Nodular nonsuppurative panniculitis describes a rare group of skin disorders characterized by tender, painful bumps below the surface of the skin (subcutaneous nodules) that usually lead to inflammation of the subcutaneous layer of fat (panniculitis). These nodules tend to be 1-2 centimeters in length and most often affect the legs and feet. In most people, this condition is associated with fever, a general feeling of ill health (malaise), muscle pain, and/or abdominal pain. The exact cause of Nodular nonsuppurative panniculitis is unknown."
"Summary of Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a type of vasculitis or swelling (inflammation) of the blood vessels. The disease can cause swelling of the blood vessels anywhere in the body but mainly impacts the sinuses, nose, trachea (windpipe), lungs, and kidneys. The swelling can limit the flow of blood to these body parts, causing damage. Symptoms of the disease can include sinus pain, recurrent respiratory infections, joint pain, tiredness (fatigue), and skin lesions. The exact cause of GPA is unknown, but it is a type of autoimmune disease. Diagnosis of GPA can be made with laboratory tests such as a blood test, biopsy of affected areas, and imaging of the lungs."
Summary of Leptospirosis: Leptospirosis is an anthropozoonosis caused by spiral-shaped bacteria belonging to the genus Leptospira. Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonosis with a worldwide distribution and has emerged as a major public health problem in developing countries in South-East Asia and South America.
"Summary of Proximal spinal muscular atrophy type 1: Spinal muscular atrophy 1 (SMA1), also known as Werdnig Hoffmann disease, is a genetic neuromuscular disorder that affects the nerve cells that control voluntary muscles (motor neurons). Without treatment, symptoms of SMA1 become apparent before 6 months of age and include worsening muscle weakness and poor muscle tone (hypotonia) due to loss of the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem. Feeding and breathing problems may also present. SMA1 is caused by changes (pathogenic variants also called genetic changes) in the SMN1 gene and is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis of SMA1 is suspected by symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing. SMA has been added to the list of recommended newborn screening tests in the United States, so that it can be detected prior to symptoms developing."
"Summary of Werner syndrome: Werner syndrome is a condition that causes premature aging. People with this syndrome will develop and grow normally until puberty. At puberty, growth stops and adults with Werner syndrome are typically shorter than average. By the early 20s-30s, people with this syndrome develop conditions usually associated with more advanced ages. In addition, people with Werner syndrome have an increased risk of developing cancer, especially thyroid and skin cancers. Heart attack and cancer are the most common causes of death. Werner syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the WRN gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This condition is diagnosed based on the symptoms and genetic testing."
"Summary of Infantile spasms syndrome: Infantile spasms syndrome is characterized by a specific type of seizure (infantile spasms) seen in infancy and childhood. This syndrome leads to developmental regression and causes a specific pattern, known as hypsarrhythmia (chaotic brain waves), on electroencephalography (EEG) testing. The infantile spasms usually begin in the first year of life, typically between 4-8 months. The seizures primarily consist of a sudden bending forward of the body with stiffening of the arms and legs; some children arch their backs as they extend their arms and legs. Spasms tend to occur upon awakening or after feeding, and often occur in clusters of up to 100 spasms at a time. Infants may have dozens of clusters and several hundred spasms per day. Many disorders leading to brain injury, such as birth problems, cerebral anomalies, metabolic disorders, and genetic disorders can lead to these spasms, making it important to identify the underlying cause. In some children, no cause can be found. Some children have spasms as the result of brain lesions, and surgical removal of these lesions may result in improvement."
"Summary of Western equine encephalitis: An acute arboviral infection caused by an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family transmitted by an infected mosquito, that more frequently affects children and that is characterized by the presence of mild flulike symptoms (fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia) but that can progress to weakness, altered mental status, photophobia, mental confusion, seizures, somnolence, coma and/or even death. The disease can leave neurological sequelae, mainly in infants and children, such as seizures, spasticity or behavioral disorders."
"Summary of Whipple disease: Whipple disease is an infectious bacterial disease that affects many different organ systems and interferes with the body's ability to process (metabolize) fats. The disease usually occurs in the gastrointestinal system, but may affect any part of the body including the heart, lungs, brain, joints, and eyes. In the gastrointestinal system, it interferes with the body's ability to absorb certain nutrients. This leads to a condition known as malabsorption. Whipple disease causes weight loss, incomplete breakdown of carbohydrates or fats, and problems with the immune system. It is caused by infection from bacteria called Tropheryma whipplei."
"Summary of Intellectual disability-developmental delay-contractures syndrome: Intellectual disability-developmental delay-contractures syndrome is a rare, slowly progressive genetic disorder that is present at birth. It is characterized by contractures of the joints of the feet (arthrogryposis multiplex congenita), muscle degeneration (atrophy), mild intellectual disability and an impaired ability to move certain muscles of the eyes, face and tongue. Other symptoms might include spasticity and seizures. Intellectual disability-developmental delay-contractures syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the ZC4H2 gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion. Most people with Intellectual disability-developmental delay-contractures syndrome are male; however carrier females have been reported to have mild symptoms."
"Summary of Williams syndrome: Williams syndrome is a genetic condition that affects many parts of the body. Signs and symptoms include mild to moderate intellectual disability; unique personality traits; distinctive facial features; and heart and blood vessel problems. Williams syndrome is caused by a person missing more than 25 genes from a specific area of chromosome 7 (a ""deletion""). The loss of these genes contributes to the characteristic features. Although Williams syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition, most cases are not inherited and occur sporadically in people with no family history of Williams syndrome."
"Summary of Nephroblastoma: A rare malignant renal tumor, typically affecting the pediatric population, characterized by an abnormal proliferation of cells that resemble the kidney cells of an embryo (metanephroma), leading to the term embryonal tumor."
"Summary of Wilson disease: Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder that is characterized by the accumulation of copper in the body. Because high levels of copper are toxic to tissues and organs, this buildup can lead to damage of the liver, brain and eyes. Signs and symptoms of Wilson disease include chronic liver disease, central nervous system abnormalities, and psychiatric (mental health-related) disturbances. It is caused by a genetic change of the ATP7B gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Winchester syndrome: Winchester syndrome is a rare disease that causes the breakdown of the bones in the hands and feet. It is similar to another condition called multicentric osteolysis, nodulosis, and arthropathy (MONA). Unlike MONA, Winchester syndrome does not cause lumps under the skin. People with this syndrome may also have other symptoms like a lack of defined facial features, cloudy eyes, overgrowth of the gums, and an abnormal heart rhythm."
"Summary of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: Wiskott Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a disease with immunological deficiency and reduced ability to form blood clots. Signs and symptoms include easy bruising or bleeding due to a decrease in the number and size of platelets; susceptibility to infections and to immune and inflammatory disorders; and an increased risk for some cancers (such as lymphoma). Also, a skin condition known as eczema is common in people with WAS. Wiskott Aldrich syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the WAS gene and is inherited in an X-linked manner. It primarily affects males. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT), and X-linked neutropenia (XLN) are known as 'WAS-related disorders' because these diseases are all caused by genetic changes in the WAS gene, and have overlapping symptoms ranging from severe to mild (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is the most severe)."
"Summary of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome: Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. The major features include a characteristic facial appearance, delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, low muscle tone (hypotonia), and seizures. Other features may include skeletal abnormalities, congenital heart defects, hearing loss, urinary tract malformations, and/or structural brain abnormalities. WHS is caused by a missing piece (deletion) of genetic material near the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 (written as 4p-). The size of the deletion varies among people with WHS, and studies suggest larger deletions tend to result in more severe features. Most cases of WHS are not inherited, but some cases are inherited from a parent who does not have WHS."
Summary of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Wolfram syndrome: Wolfram syndrome, which is also known by the acronym DIDMOAD, is an inherited condition characterized by diabetes insipidus (DI), childhood-onset diabetes mellitus (DM), a gradual loss of vision caused by optic atrophy (OA), and deafness (D). Other symptoms may include bladder and bowel dysfunction, problems with the parts of the inner ear and brain that help control balance and eye movements (vestibular deficits), temperature regulation problems, decreased balance, uncoordinated (ataxic) gait and olfactory deficits. Also, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression have also been noted in some cases. There are two types of Wolfram syndrome (type 1 and type 2) which are primarily differentiated by their genetic cause. Type 1 is caused by changes in the WFS1 gene, while type 2 is caused by genetic changes in the CISD2 gene. Both forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. However, some cases of Wolfram syndrome type 1 have an autosomal dominant inheritance and are more severe. Diagnosis is suspected in cases of childhood-onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, and this visual impairment is not due to the diabetes."
"Summary of Wolman disease: Wolman disease is a congenital disease characterized by an impaired metabolism of the fats (lipids). It is the most severe type of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. The lysomal acid lipase deficiency causes a buildup of lipids (fats) in body organs and calcium deposits in the adrenal glands. Common symptoms in infants include enlarged liver and spleen, poor weight gain, low muscle tone, jaundice, vomiting, diarrhea, developmental delay, anemia, and poor absorption of nutrients from food. Wolman disease is caused by genetic changes in the LIPA gene which provides instructions to make the lysosomal acid lipase. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Wyburn-Mason syndrome: Wyburn Mason's syndrome is a condition in which blood vessels do not form correctly in both the retina of one eye and a part of the brain. These malformed blood vessels are called arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Wyburn Mason's syndrome is present from birth (congenital) and the cause is unknown. Individuals with this condition may have additional AVMs in other parts of the body, particularly the face. The symptoms of this condition are quite variable and depend on the size, location, and shape of the AVMs. Affected individuals may have no symptoms or may experience headaches, problems with vision, seizures, or partial paralysis (hemiparesis)."
"Summary of Recessive X-linked ichthyosis: Recessive X-linked ichthyosis is a disorder in which the skin cells are produced at a normal rate but they do not separate properly at the surface of the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of the skin). This slows the rate of shedding of the skin cells, resulting in a build-up of scales. The scales of Recessive X-linked ichthyosis are often dark and usually cover only a portion of the body. Typically, the trunk and back of the neck are more likely to be affected. Scales are usually not found on the face, scalp, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. Recessive X-linked ichthyosis mostly affects males. It is usually caused by a genetic change or deletion in the STS gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. In rare cases, the ichthyosis can be part of a genetic syndrome in which other parts of the body are affected."
"Summary of Xeroderma pigmentosum: Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) causes the skin and eyes to be extra sensitive to exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and other sources. Symptoms begin in early childhood. People with XP can develop bad sunburns, blistering, and freckling in response to sunlight. The eyes may develop light sensitivity, corneal clouding, and swelling. Some people with XP have nervous system involvement as well. People with XP are at very high risk of developing skin cancer and other types of cancers. XP is caused by variants in one of at least nine genes involved in repairing damaged DNA. XP is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the clinical findings and specialized testing on skin cells. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
Summary of Yaws: A systemic non-venereal infection of the tropics caused by TREPONEMA PALLIDUM subspecies pertenue.
"Summary of Yellow fever: Yellow fever (YF), caused by YF virus, is a zoonotic disease characterized by fever and constitutional symptoms, with the potential to progress to severe and fatal viral hemorrhagic fever with shock and multi-organ system failure."
"Summary of Zellweger syndrome: Zellweger syndrome is the most severe form of a spectrum of conditions called Zellweger spectrum. The signs and symptoms of Zellweger syndrome typically appear during the newborn period and may include poor muscle tone (hypotonia), poor feeding, seizures, hearing loss, vision loss, distinctive facial features, and skeletal abnormalities. Affected children also develop life-threatening problems in other organs and tissues, such as the liver, heart, and kidneys. Zellweger syndrome is caused by genetic changes in any one of at least 12 genes; genetic changes in the PEX1 gene are the most common cause. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a condition in which tumors called gastrinomas in the pancreas and duodenum (part of the small intestine) cause high levels of the hormone gastrin in the blood. High levels of gastrin then cause production of too much stomach acid. Signs and symptoms may include abdominal pain, peptic ulcers, vomiting blood, and diarrhea. The tumors are sometimes cancerous and may spread to other areas of the body. In most cases, the cause of ZES is unknown. However, about 25-30% of gastrinomas are caused by an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)."
Summary of Zuska's disease: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Muscular dystrophy: Muscular dystrophy (MD) refers to a group of more than 30 genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal muscles that control movement. Some forms of MD are seen in newborns, infants or children, while others have late-onset and may not appear until middle age or later. The disorders differ in terms of the distribution and extent of muscle weakness (some forms of MD also affect cardiac muscle), age of onset, rate of progression, and pattern of inheritance."
Summary of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic aciduria: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Adenomyosis: Adenomyosis is a condition that affects the uterus. In women with Adenomyosis, the endometrial tissue (which typically lines the uterus) moves into the outer, muscular walls of the uterus. Some women may have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, features of the condition include heavy menstrual bleeding, painful menstrual periods, and pelvic pain during intercourse. Some women may also develop an adenomyoma, which is a mass or growth within the uterus. The underlying cause of the condition is currently unknown."
"Summary of Anthrax: Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Cutaneous (skin) Anthrax occurs when the infection enters the body through a cut or sore on the skin. It is the most common type of Anthrax and generally the least serious. Affected people may experience a group of small, itchy bumps; swelling around a sore; and/or a painless ulcer with a black center. These skin abnormalities are generally found on the face, neck, arms, or hands. Gastrointestinal Anthrax is caused by eating undercooked meat from an infected animal. Signs and symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, loss of appetite, fever, and a sore throat. Pulmonary (lung) Anthrax occurs when Anthrax spores are inhaled. It is the most serious form of the condition. Early signs include flu-like symptoms, shortness of breath, nausea, and coughing up blood. As the condition advances, affected people may develop high fever, difficulty breathing, shock, and meningitis. Injection Anthrax is spread by injecting illegal drugs. Signs and symptoms of this form of Anthrax include redness and swelling at the sight of the infection. The condition may progress to shock, multiple organ failure and meningitis."

Summary of Megalocytic interstitial nephritis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Palmoplantar keratoderma: Palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) is a group of skin conditions characterized by thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. PPK can also be a feature of various underlying syndromes. In rare forms of PPK, organs other than the skin may also be affected. PPK can be either acquired during the lifetime (more commonly) or inherited. Acquired PPKs may arise due to changes in a person's health or environment. Inherited PPKs are caused by genetic changes that result in abnormalities of keratin, a skin protein. Depending on the genetic cause, inheritance can be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive."
"Summary of IgG4-related mesenteritis: IgG4-related mesenteritis is one of many terms that describes a spectrum of inflammatory disorders that affect the mesentery. The mesentery is the membrane that anchors the small intestine to the back of the abdominal wall. The condition mostly affects men between their 40s and 60s, but women and children can also be affected. It may result in a variety of symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, weight loss, and fever. Some people have an abdominal mass. The cause of the condition is poorly understood. Suggested possible causes have included previous abdominal surgery or trauma, autoimmunity, paraneoplastic syndromes, ischemic injury, and infection."
Summary of Severe infantile axonal neuropathy: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Candida glabrata: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Transient global amnesia: Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a condition characterized by sudden onset of memory loss and confusion. During an episode of TGA, a person is not able to make new memories. The person may be disoriented in regard to time and place, but can remember who they are and can recognize family members. TGA typically lasts for several hours, but can last up to ten hours. Since no memories are made during a TGA episode, the person will never remember what happened during this period, but all other memory is usually intact. Most people have only one episode of TGA during their lifetime. The underlying cause of TGA is unclear."
"Summary of Achondroplasia: Achondroplasia is a disorder of bone growth that prevents the changing of cartilage (particularly in the long bones of the arms and legs) to bone. It is characterized by dwarfism, limited range of motion at the elbows, large head size (macrocephaly), small fingers, and normal intelligence. Achondroplasia can cause health complications such as interruption of breathing (apnea), obesity, recurrent ear infections, an exaggerated inward curve of the lumbar spine (lordosis). More serious problems include a narrowing of the spinal canal that can pinch (compress) the upper part of the spinal cord (spinal stenosis) and a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Some people with Achondroplasia may have delayed motor development early on, but cognition is normal. Achondroplasia is caused by genetic changes in the FGFR3 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Cryptomicrotia-brachydactyly-excess fingertip arch syndrome: Cryptomicrotia - brachydactyly - excess fingertip arch syndrome describes a combination of malformations that include bilateral cryptomicrotia, brachytelomesophalangy with short middle and distal phalanges of digits 2 through 5, hypoplastic toenails and excess fingertip arch patterns, and has been reported in one family (mother and son). Cryptomicrotia - brachydactyly - excess fingertip arch syndrome is thought to follow an autosomal dominant transmission. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1988."
"Summary of Achard syndrome: A rare genetic syndrome featuring connective tissue abnormalities. Clinical signs include brachycephaly, arachnodactyly, receding mandible and joint laxity at the hands and feet."
Summary of Basedow's coma: This section is currently in development.

Summary of Punctate porokeratosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Proximal symphalangism: Proximal symphalangism, which is also called Cushing's symphalangism, is a rare genetic condition characterized by the fusion of the proximal joints in the hands and feet. These individuals usually have straight fingers and are unable to make a fist. Other joints may also be affected, leading to stiff joints in the elbows, ankles and wrists. Hearing loss due to the fusion of the auditory ossicles (bones in the middle ear) is also a characteristic feature. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by a genetic change in the NOG gene or GDF5 gene."
"Summary of Ossicular Malformations, familial: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Conotruncal heart malformations: A group of congenital cardiac outflow tract anomalies that include such defects as tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, double-outlet right ventricle (DORV), double-outlet left ventricle, truncus arteriosus and transposition of the great arteries (TGA), among others. This group of defects is frequently found in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome . A deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 has equally been associated in a subset of patients with various types of isolated non-syndromic conotruncal heart malformations (with the exception of DORV and TGA where this is very uncommon)."
"Summary of Uveal diseases: A non-neoplastic or neoplastic disorder that affects the uvea. Representative examples include uveitis, chorioretinitis, and uveal melanoma."
"Summary of Cysticercosis: Cysticercosis is an infection caused by the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. The condition develops when tapeworm eggs, which can be found in contaminated food, enter the body and form cysticeri (cysts). In most cases, the worms stay in the muscles and do not cause symptoms. However, symptoms may be present when the infection is found in the brain, eyes, heart or spine. Although rare in the United States, Cysticercosis is common in many developing countries."
"Summary of Strongyloidiasis: Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the roundworm Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis). People catch the infection when they come in contact with soil contaminated with the worms. While there are often no symptoms, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea, rash, unintentional weight loss and vomiting may occur. Strongyloidiasis is found in tropical and subtropical areas, but can also be found in temperate regions, including the southern United States."
Summary of Spirurida Infections: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Smith-Magenis syndrome: Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. The major features of this condition include mild to moderate intellectual disability, delayed speech and language skills, distinctive facial features, sleep disturbances, and behavioral problems. Most people with SMS have a deletion of genetic material in each cell from a specific region of chromosome 17. Although this region contains multiple genes, the loss of one particular gene, RAI1, is responsible for most of the features of the condition. In most of these cases, the deletion is not inherited, occurring randomly during the formation of eggs or sperm, or in early fetal development. In about 10% of cases, SMS is caused by a genetic change in the RAI1 gene. These genetic changes may occur randomly, or may be inherited from a parent in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Omenn syndrome: Omenn syndrome is an autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) characterized by erythroderma (skin redness), desquamation (peeling skin), alopecia (hair loss), chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), eosinophilia, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated serum IgE levels. Patients are highly susceptible to infection and develop fungal, bacterial, and viral infections typical of SCID. In this syndrome, the SCID is associated with low IgG, IgA, and IgM and the virtual absence of B cells. There is an elevated number of T cells, but their function is impaired. Omenn syndrome has been found to be caused by genetic changes in the RAG1 or RAG2 genes. Additional causative genes have been identified."
Summary of Secernentea Infections: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Rhabditida Infections: Infections with nematodes of the order RHABDITIDA.
"Summary of Immunoglobulin A vasculitis: Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), also called immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV), is a vascular disease that primarily affects small blood vessels. The disease is characterized by abnormal deposits of immunoglobulin A (an antibody) in the blood vessels, leading to their inflammation (vasculitis). The small vessels of the skin, joints, kidneys, and digestive organs are particularly involved. Signs and symptoms usually begin suddenly (and progress over days) and may include purple-colored spots on the skin (purpura); joint pain; and gastrointestinal problems such as abdominal pain, nausea, bloody stools, and rarely, severe complications requiring surgery. People with HSP may also develop glomerulonephritis (injury to the kidneys caused by inflammation) and poor kidney function, which may result in swelling of parts of the body or face (edema), and blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria). Most cases of HSP occur in children and go away without causing serious or long-term health problems. Less commonly, the disease affects adults and may be more severe, leading to chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. The cause of HSP is not completely understood, but research indicates that genes (especially those involved in regulating the immune system) may play a key role in predisposing a person to HSP, as well as its severity. However, while genes may increase the risk of developing the disease (and in some cases more than one family member has HSP), the disease itself is not inherited. The diagnosis of HSP may be made based on symptoms, blood and urine tests, imaging studies, and/or a biopsy of the skin or kidney."
"Summary of Congenital generalized hypertrichosis, Ambras type: Congenital generalized hypertrichosis, Ambras type is a very rare type of hypertrichosis lanuginosa congenita, a congenital skin disease characterized by excessive hair growth on the entire body, with the exception of the palms, soles, and mucous membranes. Individuals with Congenital generalized hypertrichosis, Ambras type have excessive growth of vellus (soft, fine and short) hair, especially on the face, ears, and shoulders. Facial and dental abnormalities may also be present. Congenital generalized hypertrichosis, Ambras type has been mapped to the short (q) arm of chromosome 8. It appears to follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Pineocytoma: A Pineocytoma is a tumor of the pineal gland, a small organ in the brain that makes melatonin (a sleep-regulating hormone). Signs and symptoms of Pineocytomas include headaches, nausea, hydrocephalus, vision abnormalities, and Parinaud syndrome. Pineocytomas are usually slow-growing and rarely spread to other parts of the body."
"Summary of Tropical spastic paraparesis: HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a progressive disease of the nervous system that affects less than 2% of people with HTLV-1 infection. Signs and symptoms vary but may include slowly progressive weakness and spasticity of one or both legs, exaggerated reflexes, muscle contractions in the ankle, and lower back pain. Other features may include urinary incontinence and minor sensory changes, especially burning or prickling sensations and loss of vibration sense. The reason some people with HTLV-1 infection develop HAM/TSTP is not well understood."
Summary of Neurofibrosarcoma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Lafora disease: Lafora disease is an inherited, severe form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy. The condition most commonly begins with epileptic seizures in late childhood or adolescence. Other signs and symptoms include difficulty walking, muscle spasms (myoclonus) and dementia. Affected people also experience rapid cognitive deterioration that begins around the same time as the seizures. Most cases are caused by changes in either the EPM2A gene or the NHLRC1 gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Mondini dysplasia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Mansonelliasis: Mansonellosis is a mild form of filariasis (see this term), distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa as well as in some locations of Central and South America and the Caribbean, caused by the parasitic worms Mansonella perstans and Mansonella ozzardi. The disease is often asymptomatic but may also cause fever, vertigo, myalgias, arthralgias and a sensation of coldness in the legs. Additional features include neuropsychiatric symptoms, skin rash, pruritus, nodules containing adult worms (in the conjunctiva or eyelids), lymphadenopathy, recurrent lymphedema in the limbs and face (resembling the Calabar swellings of loasis (see this term)), severe abdominal pain and endocrine disturbances."

"Summary of B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia: A rare mature B-cell neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of B-cell prolymphocytes, with prolymphocytes constituting more than 55% of lymphoid cells in peripheral blood. IG genes are clonally rearranged. Neoplastic cells are present in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and spleen. Patients usually present with B symptoms, massive splenomegaly but absent or minimal lymphadenopathy, rapidly increasing lymphocyte count, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Therapy response is poor."
"Summary of Leukemia, T-cell, chronic: A slow-growing type of leukemia (blood cancer) in which too many lymphocytes are found in the bone marrow and/or blood. The T-cell is specified as the defective cell line."
"Summary of Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: A rare myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a spectrum of clinical, hematological, and morphological features, ranging from predominantly myelodysplastic to mainly myeloproliferative in nature. Infiltration of the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and other organs is common. Persistent peripheral blood monocytosis with monocytes accounting for more than 10% of leukocytes is the hallmark of the condition. Blasts constitute less than 20% of the cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Other abnormalities are variable. Patients may present with constitutional symptoms, signs and symptoms of hematopoietic insufficiency, and hepatosplenomegaly. The disease is associated with a risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia."
"Summary of Myeloid leukemia: A clonal proliferation of myeloid cells and their precursors in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and spleen. When the proliferating cells are immature myeloid cells and myeloblasts, it is called acute myeloid leukemia. When the proliferating myeloid cells are neutrophils, it is called chronic myelogenous leukemia."
"Summary of Portal hypertension: Portal hypertension is abnormally high blood pressure in branches of the portal vein, the large vein that brings blood from the intestine to the liver. Portal hypertension itself does not cause symptoms, but complications from the condition can lead to an enlarged abdomen, abdominal discomfort, confusion, drowsiness and internal bleeding. It may be caused by a variety of conditions, but cirrhosis is the most common cause in Western countries."
"Summary of Homocysteinemia: Hyperhomocysteinemia refers to above-normal concentrations of plasma/serum homocysteine. Plasma/serum homocysteine is the sum of the thiol-containing amino acid homocysteine and the homocysteinyl moiety of the disulfides homocystine and cysteine-homocysteine, whether free or bound to proteins (Malinow and Stampfer, 1994).Hyperhomocysteinemia in isolation may be associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis usually in the third or fourth decade of life (review by Welch and Loscalzo, 1998).Homocysteinemia is also a feature of several inherited metabolic disorders, including homocystinuria (236200), due to mutation in the CBS gene (613381), and N(5,10)-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency (236250), caused by mutation in the MTHFR gene (607093). Homocysteinemia/homocystinuria and megaloblastic anemia can result from defects in vitamin B12 (cobalamin; cbl) metabolism, which have been classified according to complementation groups of cells in vitro; see cblE (236270) and cblG (250940). See also the various forms of combined methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) and homocystinuria due to disorders of cobalamin: cblC (277400), cblD (277410), and cblF (277380)."

"Summary of Hemangioblastoma: A Hemangioblastoma is a benign, highly vascular tumor that can occur in the brain, spinal cord, and retina (the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye). This tumor accounts for about 2% of brain tumors. As it enlarges, it presses on the brain and can cause neurological symptoms, such as headaches, weakness, sensory loss, balance and coordination problems, and/or hydrocephalus (a buildup of spinal fluid in the brain). Most Hemangioblastomas occur sporadically. However, some people develop Hemangioblastomas as part of a genetic syndrome called von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. These people usually develop multiple tumors within the brain and spinal cord over their lifetime."

"Summary of Sea-blue histiocytosis: Sea-Blue histiocytosis, also known as inherited lipemic splenomegaly, is an extremely rare condition characterized by elevated triglyceride levels (hypertriglyceridemia) and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). The disorder is so named because certain white blood cells, known as histiocytes, appear bright blue when stained and viewed under the microscope. Additional signs and symptoms may include a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), liver function abnormalities, and heart disease. It is one of a group of related fat (lipid) disorders caused by certain changes in the APOE gene. The genetic change associated with this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner though other factors, such as a patient's gender, the patient's lipid levels, and the genetic makeup of the other APOE gene may play a role in how the condition is expressed."

"Summary of Spermatogenic failure, x-linked, 1: Spermatogenic failure, x-linked, 1 is a cause of male infertility. In Spermatogenic failure, x-linked, 1, only Sertoli cells (cells that nurture the immature sperm) line the seminiferous tubules (tubes inside the testicles where sperm develop). Therefore, there are not any sperm cells present in the seminiferous tubules. Men typically learn they are affected when being evaluated for infertility and are found to have no sperm production (azoospermia). Other signs and symptoms are rare, but in some cases there could be an underlying cause of Spermatogenic failure, x-linked that causes other symptoms, such as Klinefelter syndrome. Most cases of Spermatogenic failure, x-linked are idiopathic (of unknown cause), but causes may include deletions of genetic information on regions of the Y-chromosome, especially on the azoospermia factor (AZF) region of Y-chromosome. Other causes include exposure to chemicals or toxins, history of radiation therapy, and history of severe trauma. Diagnosis of Spermatogenic failure, x-linked is confirmed with testicular biopsy."

This condition is caused by genetic alterations in the STAC3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. STAC3 Disorder is diagnosed based on the symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of King-Denborough syndrome: King Denborough syndrome is a congenital myopathy associated with susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, skeletal abnormalities and dysmorphic features with characteristic facial appearance. Although the cause of King Denborough syndrome is not fully understood, at least some cases have been attributed to the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1), which has been tied to malignant hyperthermia and central core disease."
"Summary of Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome: Persistent MÃ¼llerian duct syndrome affects the development of the sexual organs in males. Males with Persistent MÃ¼llerian duct syndrome have normal testes and normal male external genitals as well as  a uterus and fallopian tubes (female reproductive organs). Early ymptoms of Persistent MÃ¼llerian duct syndrome may include undescended testes (cryptorchidism) or inguinal hernias. The uterus and fallopian tubes are usually found by accident treatment of these symptoms. Other features of Persistent MÃ¼llerian duct syndrome may include infertility and an increased risk for testicular cancer. Persistent MÃ¼llerian duct syndrome occurs due to genetic variants in either the AMH gene (Persistent MÃ¼llerian duct syndrome type 1) or AMHR2 gene (Persistent MÃ¼llerian duct syndrome type 2). It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In some cases, the genetic cause is unknown. Diagnosis of Persistent MÃ¼llerian duct syndrome is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and imaging studies. The results of genetic testing may also be helpful for diagnosis."
"Summary of Frontotemporal dementia: Frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain. Symptoms include marked changes in social behavior and personality, and/or problems with language. People with behavior changes may have disinhibition (with socially inappropriate behavior), apathy and loss of empathy, hyperorality (eating excessive amounts of food or attempting to consume inedible things), agitation, compulsive behavior, and various other changes. Examples of problems with language include difficulty speaking or understanding speech. Some people with FTD also develop a motor syndrome such as parkinsonism or motor neuron disease (which may be associated with various additional symptoms). There is a strong genetic component to FTDs. It sometimes follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, or sometimes there is a general family history of dementia or psychiatric disorders. The three main genes responsible for familial FTD are MAPT, GRN, and C9orf72. However, the genetic cause of familial FTD cannot always be identified."

"Summary of Tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 associated periodic syndrome: Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever. Episodes can begin at any age but most often begin in early childhood. Fevers typically last about 3 weeks but can last from a few days to a few months. Episodes usually occur spontaneously, but are sometimes brought on by a variety of triggers (such as injury, infection, or stress). Symptoms during fever episodes may include abdominal, muscle or joint pains; skin rashes (usually on the limbs); puffiness around the eyes; and inflammation in various areas of the body. Some people develop amyloidosis. TRAPS is caused by genetic changes in the TNFRSF1A gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."

"Summary of Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 1: Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 1 is an inherited autoimmune condition that affects many of the body's organs. Symptoms often begin in childhood or adolescence and may include mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and Addison disease. This syndrome can cause a variety of additional signs and symptoms, such as weak teeth (enamel hypoplasia) and chronic diarrhea or constipation. Complications of Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 1 can affect the bones, joints, skin, and nails, the gonads (ovaries and testicles), the eyes, the thyroid, and several internal organs (kidneys, liver, lungs and the spleen). Anemia may also be present due to a lack of production of the red blood cells. Type 1 diabetes also occurs in some patients with this condition. Diagnosis is suspected when there are at least two of these features, specially in young people. Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 1 is caused by variations in the AIRE gene. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."

The dystonia usually begins in childhood; vision loss may begin in early adulthood."
"Summary of Renal oncocytoma: Renal oncocytoma is a benign (noncancerous) growth of the kidney. Renal oncocytoma generally do not cause any signs or symptoms and are often discovered incidentally (by chance) while a person is undergoing diagnostic imaging for other conditions. Some people with Renal oncocytoma will have abdominal or flank pain; blood in the urine; and/or an abdominal mass. Although these tumors can occur in people of all ages, they most commonly develop in men who are over age 50. The exact underlying cause of most isolated (single tumor affecting one kidney) Renal oncocytomas is unknown. Multiple and bilateral (affecting both kidneys) Renal oncocytomas sometimes occur in people with certain genetic syndromes such as tuberous sclerosis complex and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome."
"Summary of Familial multiple discoid fibromas: Familial multiple discoid fibromas (FMDF) is an autosomal dominant dermatologic condition characterized by the appearance of multiple skin-colored, firm, flat or dome-shaped papules on the pinnae and the central area of the face in childhood or adolescence. Most lesions show a hair at or just outside the periphery, and many have a telangiectatic surface (summary by Starink et al., 2012).Trichodiscoma, as this lesion was first described by Pinkus et al. (1974), is a small benign fibrovascular tumor of the dermal part of the hair disc. The hair disc is a richly vascularized dermal pad in close association with a hair. It is supplied by a thick myelinated nerve and is considered to be a slow-adapting mechanoreceptor. Trichodiscomas are small, flat or dome-shaped, skin-colored, firm papules with a telangiectatic surface. Many of the lesions show a hair at the periphery or just outside it. Starink et al. (2012) renamed the lesion 'discoid fibroma' as a clarification of the histologic findings.FMDF is similar to, but histologically and genetically distinct from, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD; 135150), which is characterized by fibrofolliculomas as well as renal and pulmonary cysts."

Summary of MASS phenotype: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Ectopia pupillae: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Meningioma, radiation-induced: Meningioma is a type of brain tumor that can sometimes be caused by radiation therapy. This means that after receiving radiation treatment, a person may develop another cancer later on. In a study of six people with radiation-induced meningiomas, researchers found that all of them also had the same chromosome abnormality. This suggests that a difference in a gene on chromosome 1p11 may be involved in causing radiation-induced meningiomas. Another area of the chromosome, 22q12.3-qter, is also known to be a common site of mutation that can cause meningiomas."
"Summary of Ribbing disease: Ribbing disease is a rare disease that causes bony growths to develop on the long bones. These bony growths most commonly affect the long bones of the lower legs, such as the thigh bone (femur) and shin bone (tibia) but can also affect the long bones of the arms. Symptoms of the disease may include pain and muscle weakness in the areas where the bone growths are occurring. The bone growths typically occur only on one side of the body or in different bones on both sides of the body. Ribbing disease has similar signs and symptoms to another disease called Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). However, symptoms of CED typically begin at a younger age and may affect more bones on both sides of the body than Ribbing disease does. The exact cause of Ribbing disease is currently unknown. Diagnosis of Ribbing disease is based on observing symptoms of the disease such as bone pain, especially in the bones of the legs. The diagnosis may be confirmed by imaging procedures"

"Summary of Coloboma of optic nerve: Coloboma of the optic nerve is a congenital eye abnormality in which the optic nerve (which carries images of what the eye sees to the brain) is not completely formed. The condition may occur in one or both eyes. The degree of visual impairment varies widely depending on the severity and structures involved. Detachments of the retina may occur in in people who have Coloboma of optic nerve. Other associated symptoms may include a small eye (microphthalmia) with or without a cyst; small cornea (microcornea); or coloboma of other eye structures. Although the condition is present from birth, diagnosis may be delayed since the coloboma is inside the eye and not visible by simple inspection. Coloboma of the optic nerve may occur sporadically, may be due to a genetic change and be inherited, or may occur as a feature of an underlying syndrome or other genetic condition."
Summary of Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Classical-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 1: Classical-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a form of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) characterized by an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility), skin that is soft, stretchy, and fragile and easy bruising. Other symptoms might include muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy), and protrusion of part of the stomach through the diaphragm in the chest cavity (hiatal hernia). Classical-like EDS is caused by genetic changes in both copies of the TNXB gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. However, some individuals with a genetic change in only one copy of the TNXB gene can have symptoms similar to EDS hypermobility type including joint hypermobility and soft skin. Some individuals with classical-like EDS can have larger deletions of genetic material including other genes. These individuals may have additional symptoms."

"Summary of Macrodactyly of fingers: Macrodactyly of the hand is a rare condition in which a person's fingers are abnormally large due to the overgrowth of the underlying bone and soft tissue. Although babies are born with the condition, macrodactyly is usually not inherited. Most of the time, only one hand is affected, but usually more than one finger is involved. Macrodactyly may also coexist with syndactyly (two fingers are fused together) or clinodactyly (a finger, usually the pinky, is curved toward another finger)."
"Summary of Male infertility with azoospermia or oligozoospermia due to single gene mutation: Male infertility with azoospermia or oligospermia due to single gene mutation is a rare, genetic male infertility due to sperm disorder characterized by the absence of a measurable amount of spermatozoa in the ejaculate (azoospermia), or a number of sperm in the ejaculate inferior to 15 million/mL (oligozoospermia), resulting from a mutation in a single gene known to cause azoo- or oligo-spermia. Sperm morphology may be normal."
"Summary of Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis: Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP) is an inherited condition that increases the chance to develop cancer of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. It is a milder form of classic familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). SYmptom may include colon polyps, benign or malignant tumors of the duodenum (a section of the small intestine) and, in rare cases, other symptoms of FAP. AFAP is caused by genetic changes in the APC gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer: Familial colon cancer is a cluster of colon cancer within a family. Most cases of colon cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition. Approximately 3-5% of colon cancer is considered ""hereditary"" and is thought to be caused by an inherited predisposition to colon cancer that is passed down through a family in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. In some of these families, the underlying genetic cause is not known; however, many of these cases are caused by changes in the APC, MYH, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM, PTEN, STK11, SMAD4, BMPR1A, NTHL1, POLE, and POLD1 genes (which are associated with hereditary cancer syndromes). An additional 10-30% of people diagnosed with colon cancer have a significant family history of the condition but have no identifiable genetic change in a gene known to cause a hereditary predisposition to colon cancer. These clusters of colon cancer are likely due to a combination of gene(s) and other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle."
"Summary of Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis: Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) is a skin disorder characterized by recurring itchy, red or skin-colored bumps and pustules (bumps containing pus). Skin biopsies of this disorder find eosinophils (a type of immune cell) around hair follicles. The pustules mostly appear on the face, scalp, neck and trunk and may persist for weeks or months. EPF affects males more than females. There are several variants of EPF including classic Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (mainly occurring in adults in Japan); HIV-associated EPF, also referred to as immunosuppression-associated EPF; and infantile EPF (with onset from birth or within the first year of life)."
"Summary of Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that affects breathing. It has two forms of presentation, a classic form that usually begin shortly after birth in newborns, and a milder later-onset presentaition in toddlers, children and adults. Infants with CCHS may  hypoventilate upon falling asleep and exhibit a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis). Other symptoms may include difficulty regulating heart rate and blood pressure; decreased perception of pain; low body temperature; sporadic profuse sweating; Hirschsprung disease; constipation; learning difficulties; eye abnormalities; and a characteristic facial appearance (having a short, wide, somewhat flattened face). CCHS may be associated with tumors of neural crest origin, such as neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, and ganglioneuroma. CCHS is caused by a variation in the PHOX2B gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, over 90% of cases are due to a new genetic change in the affected person and are not inherited from a parent. Diagnosis is made with the clinical symptoms and the genetic test showing the variation in the PHOX2B gene."
"Summary of 46,XY disorder of sex development: A 46, XY disorders of sexual development (DSD) is a condition in which an individual with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell, the pattern normally found in males, have genitalia that is not clearly male or female. Infants with this condition tend to have penoscrotal hypospadias, abnormal development of the testes, and reduced to no sperm production. Some individuals with 46, XY DSD have fully to underdeveloped female reproductive organs (e.g., uterus and fallopian tubes), while others do not. People with with 46, XY DSD may be raised as males or females."

"Summary of Trypanosomiasis, Human West-African: Trypanosomiasis caused by infection by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense."
"Summary of Primary progressive aphasia: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) affects a person's ability to use language to communicate. This includes loss of ability to understand or express speech (aphasia). PPA is a specific type of a more general disease called frontotemporal dementia. PPA can be classified into three distinct types:  progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD), and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA).  PPA is caused by a loss of tissue (atrophy) in the area of the brain that is responsible for producing language. In some cases, this loss of tissue is caused by genetic changes (genetic changes or pathogenic variants) in the GRN gene. In these cases, the disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Diagnosis of PPA is suspected when a doctor observes signs and symptoms such as progressive loss of language abilities. Imaging of the brain can confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Chondrodysplasia punctata: A heterogeneous group of bone dysplasias, the common character of which is stippling of the epiphyses in infancy. The group includes a severe autosomal recessive form (CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, RHIZOMELIC), an autosomal dominant form (Conradi-Hunermann syndrome), and a milder X-linked form. Metabolic defects associated with impaired peroxisomes are present only in the rhizomelic form."
"Summary of Accessory navicular bone: Accessory navicular bone is an extra bone or piece of cartilage located in the middle of the foot near the navicular bone, the bone that goes across the foot near the instep. It is present from birth (congenital) and is a common trait. There are three types of Accessory navicular bones which are differentiated by location, size, and tissues involved (bone and/or cartilage). Although some people with an Accessory navicular bone never develop symptoms, a bump can develop in the affected region that can lead to irritation, swelling, and pain. Inheritance appears to be autosomal dominant."
Summary of Accessory deep peroneal nerve: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Gitelman syndrome: Gitelman syndrome is a kidney function disorder that causes an imbalance of charged atoms (ions) in the body, including ions of potassium, magnesium, and calcium. It is usually diagnosed during late childhood or adulthood. Common symptoms include fatigue, salt craving, thirst, frequent urination, muscle cramping, muscle weakness, dizziness, tingling or numbness, low blood pressure, and heart palpitations. Gitelman syndrome can be caused by changes in the SLC12A3 or CLCNKB genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Moebius syndrome: Moebius syndrome is a rare neurological condition that primarily affects the muscles that control facial expression and eye movement. Symptoms of the condition may include weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles; feeding, swallowing, and choking problems; excessive drooling; crossed eyes; lack of facial expression; eye sensitivity; high or cleft palate; hearing problems; dental abnormalities; bone abnormalities in the hands and feet; and/or speech difficulties. Affected children often experience delayed development of motor skills (such as crawling and walking). Moebius syndrome is caused by the absence or underdevelopment of the 6th and 7th cranial nerves, which control eye movement and facial expression. Other cranial nerves may also be affected."
"Summary of Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis: A rare, genetic, ectodermal dysplasia characterized by a widespread, early-onset, reticulate hyperpigmentation that persists throughout life, mild, diffuse non-cicatricial alopecia, and onychodystrophy.

"Summary of Symphalangism, distal, with microdontia, dental pulp stones, and narrowed zygoma: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Dense deposit disease: Dense deposit disease (DDD) is a condition that primarily affects kidney function. The major symptoms of DDD are due to kidney malfunction, and often include proteinuria; hematuria; reduced amounts of urine; low levels of protein in the blood; and swelling in many areas of the body. DDD can have genetic or non-genetic causes. It can be caused by genetic changes in the C3 and CFH genes. DDD may develop as a result of both genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. It can also result from the presence of autoantibodies that block the activity of proteins needed for the body's immune response. Most cases are occur by chance in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
Summary of Rowley-Rosenberg syndrome: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Wilms tumor 2: Wilms tumor 2 is a type of kidney cancer that mainly affects children. It is caused by a change in the imprinting control region  on chromosome 11p15. Genomic imprinting is a DNA mechanism that helps control how certain genes are turned on and off.

"Summary of Seckel syndrome: Seckel syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by growth retardation, very small head (microcephaly( with intellectual disability , and unique facial features such as large eyes, beak-like nose, narrow face, and receding lower jaw. Some people with Seckel syndrome may also have blood abnormalities. Seckel syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Primary orthostatic tremor: Primary orthostatic tremor is a rare, progressive movement disorder that causes unsteadiness when standing still, due to a rapid tremor affecting the legs and trunk. The tremor is sometimes described as having 'shaky legs,' and it improves or disappears when walking, sitting, or lying down. This may cause people with Primary orthostatic tremor to attempt to sit again or walk immediately after standing, for fear of falling. People with POT may also experience tiredness, physical exhaustion, muscle stiffness or weakness, and/or pain. The diagnosis of POT relies on a clinical exam as well as a specialized test called a surface electromyogram (EMG), which measures electrical activity in the muscles. The cause of POT is not completely understood, but the disorder is thought to involve dysfunction of the brain's ability to regulate nerve signals that control muscle activity."

The first symptom is usually a painless, slow-growing bump in front of the ear, on the bottom of the mouth, or under the chin. Though the cause is currently unknown, smoking is believed to increase the chance of developing Warthin tumor."
"Summary of Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis: Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis affects the brain and how the brain works. Symptoms of Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis may include behavior changes, confusion, cognitive difficulty, and seizures. Psychosis, including visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions, has also been reported. Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis occurs mainly in adults and affects females more than males. The exact cause of Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis is not known but may involve an abnormal immune or inflammatory response. Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis is associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but the nature of the relationship between the two conditions is unclear. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and laboratory testing. More common conditions may need to be excluded first."

Some people with this condition may also experience calf hypertrophy (enlarged calf muscles), muscle cramps, and elevated levels of a substance called creatine kinase in their blood. People with this condition typically have normal development and cognitive function."
"Summary of Dysferlin-related limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R2: Dysferlin-related limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R2 is one type of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. These diseases affect the voluntary muscles, which are the muscles that are moved on purpose, such as the arm, leg, finger, toe, and facial muscles. Specifically, Dysferlin-related limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R2 is a slowly progressive disease that causes muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) of the pelvic muscles and muscles of the shoulder girdle. People who are Jewish, and specifically those of Libyan Jewish descent, are more likely to have Dysferlin-related limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R2. Dysferlin-related limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R2 is caused by variations (also known genetic changes) in the DYSF gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis of Dysferlin-related limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R2 is suspected in people who have signs and symptoms of the disease, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by a muscle biopsy and genetic testing."

"Summary of Balkan endemic nephropathy: Balkan endemic nephropathy is a kidney disease that affects people living in rural areas of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Serbia (areas along the Danube river and its tributaries). People who have Balkan endemic nephropathy develop kidney damage that slowly progresses. Many people with this disaese also develop a type of bladder cancer known as upper urothelial carcinoma (UUC). Balkan endemic nephropathy is caused by chronic dietary exposure to low concentrations of a toxin called aristolochic acid, which comes from a plant called Aristolochia clematis. Genetics factors may also be involved."
"Summary of Panuveitis: Panuveitis is inflammation of all layers of the uvea of the eye, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. These make up the middle layer of the eye. The condition can also affect the lens, retina, optic nerve, and vitreous, causing reduced vision or blindness. Signs and symptoms may include eye redness and pain; blurring; light sensitivity; decreased vision; and seeing floaters. In many cases the specific cause is unknown, but in some cases it occurs in association with other eye conditions, or with another condition or infection that also affects other body parts."
"Summary of Parkinson disease 3, autosomal dominant: Parkinson disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system. The disorder affects several regions of the brain, especially an area called the substantia nigra that controls balance and movement.Often the first symptom of Parkinson disease is trembling or shaking (tremor) of a limb, especially when the body is at rest. Typically, the tremor begins on one side of the body, usually in one hand. Tremors can also affect the arms, legs, feet, and face. Other characteristic symptoms of Parkinson disease include rigidity or stiffness of the limbs and torso, slow movement (bradykinesia) or an inability to move (akinesia), and impaired balance and coordination (postural instability). These symptoms worsen slowly over time.Parkinson disease can also affect emotions and thinking ability (cognition). Some affected individuals develop psychiatric conditions such as depression and visual hallucinations. People with Parkinson disease also have an increased risk of developing dementia, which is a decline in intellectual functions including judgment and memory.Generally, Parkinson disease that begins after age 50 is called late-onset disease. The condition is described as early-onset disease if signs and symptoms begin before age 50. Early-onset cases that begin before age 20 are sometimes referred to as juvenile-onset Parkinson disease."

"Summary of Hypercholesterolemia, familial, 2: Hypercholesterolemia, familial, 2 is a genetic condition that affects the way the body binds and transports fats (lipids). It is caused by a change in a gene called APOB on chromosome 2p24. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that a person only needs to inherit one copy of the gene variant from a parent to develop the condition. People with hypercholesterolemia, familial, 2 have high levels of cholesterol in the blood, which can lead to a higher risk for heart disease."

"Summary of Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency: Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is a progressive disease affecting motor control and movement. Symptoms of AVED include slurred speech (dysarthria), difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), numbness in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy), and progressive leg weakness. Some peolple who have AVED may experience vision loss due to damage to the back of the eye. AVED is caused by a genetic change to the TTPA gene. When this gene is damaged, vitamin E cannot be distributed throughout the body. Vitamin E is important because it protects the cells of the neurological system (neurons) from damaging molecules called free radicals. AVED is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Gastrointestinal stromal tumor: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) are a type of soft tissue tumor that usually begin in specialized nerve cells in the wall of the stomach, intestines, or rectum, known as interstitial cells of Cajal. GIST may be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). If cancerous, the tumor may also be called a soft tissue sarcoma. Symptoms depend on the location, size, and aggressiveness of the tumors, but may include vomiting of blood, bloody or tarry bowel movements, or anemia caused by chronic bleeding. Other symptoms may include painful and swollen abdomen, appendicitis-like pain, or complications due to gastrointestinal obstruction or tumor rupture. GIST may only affect one member of a family (not inherited) or several family members (familial or inherited). The risk of GIST is increased in people who have a certain variations in the KIT gene, PDGFRA genes, and possibly a few other genes. Familial GIST, which usually involves more than one tumor, may follow an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance pattern depending on the genetic variation. In very rare cases GIST may be part of a genetic syndrome, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Carney triad."

"Summary of Acquired angioedema: Acquired angioedema (AAE) is a rare disorder that causes recurrent episodes of swelling (edema) of the face or body, lasting several days. People with AAE may have swelling of the face, lips, tongue, limbs, or genitals. People with AAE can have edema of the lining of the digestive tract, which can cause abdominal pain and nausea, as well as edema of the upper airway, which can be serious. Swelling episodes may have various triggers, such as mild trauma (such as dental work), viral illness, cold exposure, pregnancy, certain foods, or emotional stress. The frequency of episodes is unpredictable and can vary widely. There are two forms of AAE. Type 1 is associated with various other diseases including lymphoproliferative disorders, and autoimmune diseases that may not become apparent until years after the angioedema begins. Type 2 is associated with an autoimmune abnormality in which a person has autoantibodies against a protein in the blood called C1-INH. In some cases, it is hard to distinguish between AAE types 1 and 2. During severe or life-threatening episodes, intensive support may be needed (such as IV fluids or intubation for a blocked airway)."

Summary of Familial partial paralysis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which tissues in the lungs become thick and stiff, or scarred, over time. The lungs then lose their ability to move oxygen to the brain and other parts of the body. Common symptoms include shortness of breath and a dry, hacking cough. In some cases fibrosis happens quickly, while in others, the process is much slower. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is 'idiopathic' which means the cause is unknown. When multiple family members are affected, it is called familial IPF."
"Summary of Harlequin syndrome: Harlequin syndrome is a syndrome affecting the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is responsible for controlling the body's natural processes such as sweating, skin flushing, and the response of the pupils to stimuli. People with Harlequin syndrome have absence of sweating and flushing of skin on one side of the body (unilateral), especially of the face, arms, and chest. The symptoms associated with Harlequin syndrome may be more likely to occur when a person has been exercising, is very warm, or is in an intense emotional situation. In these situations, one side of the body sweats and flushes appropriately as a response to the situation, whereas the other side of the body does not. The asymmetrical facial sweating and flushing associated with this condition has been named the 'Harlequin sign.' Harlequin syndrome is thought to be one of a spectrum of diseases that can cause Harlequin sign. The exact cause of Harlequin syndrome is not completely understood. Diagnosis of Harlequin syndrome is based on observing symptoms consistent with the syndrome, followed by a series of tests to rule out other diseases associated with Harlequin sign."
"Summary of Primary hyperparathyroidism: Hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder in which the parathyroid glands in the neck produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). Signs and symptoms are often mild and nonspecific, such as a feeling of weakness and fatigue, depression, or aches and pains. With more severe disease, a person may have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion or impaired thinking and memory, and increased thirst and urination. People who have Primary hyperparathyroidism may have thinning of the bones, which increases the risk of fractures. There are two main types of hyperparathyroidism: Primary hyperparathyroidism and secondary hyperparathyroidism."
"Summary of Sickle cell anemia: Sickle cell anemia is a disease in which the body produces red blood cells that are shaped like crescents or sickles. These cells do not last as long as normal, round, red blood cells, which leads to anemia (low number of red blood cells). The sickle shaped red blood cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow. Signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease usually begin in early childhood and may include anemia, repeated infections, and periodic episodes of pain (called crises). This condition is caused by genetic changes in the HBB gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
Summary of Paget disease of bone: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Systemic mastocytosis: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a form of mastocytosis in which mast cells accumulate in internal tissues and organs such as the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and small intestines. Symptoms vary based on which parts of the body are affected. SM is usually caused by somatic changes in the KIT gene and are therefore not inherited. Familial cases rarely have been reported."
"Summary of Primary myelofibrosis: Primary myelofibrosis is characterized by the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the spongy tissue tissue inside the bone (bone marrow). The spongy tissue inside bone contains the stem cells that will produce blood cells. Because of the fibrosis, the bone marrow is unable to make enough normal blood cells. This may lead to anemia, weakness, fatigue, and often, swelling of the liver and spleen. The disorder occurs when blood stem cells develop somatic genetic changes in the JAK2, MPL, CALR, and TET2 genes. Other genes may also be involved. The disorder is generally not inherited because this type of genetic change does not affect the reproductive cells (sperm and egg) only certain cells of the body (somatic)."
"Summary of Glomus vagale tumor: Glomus vagale tumor is a type of paraganglioma, which is a tumor that develops in the paraganglia (a group of cells that are found near nerve cell bunches called ganglia). Glomus vagale tumors, specifically, grow in the paraganglia located near the vagus nerve, an important cranial nerve which serves many functions including empowering the vocal cords and the muscles of swallowing. In most cases, the tumors are benign, although rare cancerous cases have been reported. Symptoms vary based on the size and location of the tumor but may include a neck mass, tinnitus (ringing or buzzing in the ears), difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, pain, cough, and/or cranial nerve paralysis. Some tumors may not be associated with any concerning features and are diagnosed by chance during imaging studies performed to investigate other conditions. In many cases, the underlying cause of Glomus vagale tumors is poorly understood, although it does affect multiple familiy members. Glomus vagale tumors can be associated with inherited syndromes caused by genetic changes in succinate dehydrogenase subunits (i.e. SDHB, SDHD, SDHA, SDHAF2, SDHC) or the MAX gene."
"Summary of Uveal melanoma: Uveal melanoma is a cancer of the pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) in the middle layer of the eye, called the uveal tract. The uveal tract has 3 main parts: (1) the choroid (the tissue layer filled with blood vessels); (2) the ciliary body (the ring of muscle tissue that changes the size of the pupil and the shape of the lens); and (3) the iris (the colored part of the eye). Most cases of Intraocular melanoma develop in the choroid, called choroidal melanoma. The ciliary body is less commonly a site of origin, and the iris is the least common. Each manifests with different clinical features and symptoms."
"Summary of Good syndrome: Good syndrome is a rare, adult-onset primary immunodeficiency suspected in patients who exhibit hypogammaglobulinemia and low levels of B cells along with a benign thymic tumor (thymoma) on chest X-ray.

"Summary of Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis: Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHLE) is a rare form of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. It is characterized by a brief but intense attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that damages the myelin (the protective covering of the nerve fibers). It may also cause bleeding in the brain, leading to damage of the white matter. Symptoms usually come on quickly and may include fever, neck stiffness, fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and coma. Although the exact cause is unclear, AHLE usually follows a viral or bacterial infection, or less often, vaccination for measles or rabies."

"Summary of Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary: Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary is a rare type of ovarian cancer. This type of tumor is known as a sex cord-stromal tumor and usually occurs in adults. Granulosa cell tumors of the ovary cause higher than normal levels of estrogen in a woman's body. The symptoms of this excess estrogen depend on the woman's menstrual status. The most common symptoms include early puberty for affected young girls, an increase in abdomen size or irregularities of menstrual cycles in premenopausal women, and abnormal uterine bleeding in postmenopausal women. The exact cause of granulosa cell tumors is unknown."

"Summary of Gastroschisis: Gastroschisis is a birth defect that occurs when a baby's intestines extend outside of the body through a hole next to the belly button. This type of defect is known as an abdominal wall defect. Sometimes other organs are also involved. The exact cause of a Gastroschisis is usually not known, but it is more common in babies born to young mothers or to mothers who may have used alcohol or tobacco during their pregnancies. Gastroschisis is typically diagnosed on routine ultrasound examinations before a baby is born. These babies may need to be born in hospitals with specialists who are experienced in treating Gastroschisis. Complications from Gastroschisis can include intestinal problems, breathing difficulties, and infection. Other complications include incomplete bowel (atresia), destruction (necrosis), perforation or twisting (volvulos)."

Summary of Benign mesonephroma: Benign mesonephroma (Wolffian tumors or Wolffian duct adenomas) are rare tumors located anywhere along the length between the ovary and vagina in sites of remnant wolffian ducts. Wolffian ducts are structures in a developing embryo that get incorporated into the reproductive system in males and degenerate in females. Wolffian tumors are thought to have a low potential to become cancerous and tend to range from 0.8 to 25 centimeters in size.
"Summary of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2: Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2 (CN-2) is a rare disorder that causes elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). Bilirubin normally is made by the body when old red blood cells are broken down. However, people with CN-2 develop hyperbilirubinemia even when red blood cells are not excessively broken down, because they have too little of a liver enzyme needed for conversion and excretion of bilirubin. The main symptom of CN-2 is persistent jaundice, which is yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes and whites of the eyes. Jaundice may become noticeable in infancy (particularly when an infant is sick or has not eaten for an extended time), but some people with CN-2 are not diagnosed until adulthood. Rarely, a person with CN-2 may develop bilirubin encephalopathy (also called kernicterus), especially during illness, prolonged fasting, or while under anesthesia. CN-2 is caused by genetic changes in the UGT1A1 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. Of note, genetic changes in the UGT1A1 gene can alternatively cause other disorders, such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 (CN-1) and Gilbert syndrome. Genetic testing to identify the specific genetic change present is sometimes needed for the correct diagnosis."

Summary of Stachybotrys chartarum: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome: Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a disorder in which the body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells (lymphocytes). This results in the overproduction of lymphocytes, which build up and cause enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver and spleen. Affected individuals have an increased risk of developing cancer of the immune system cells (lymphoma) and may be at increased risk for other cancers. They can also have a variety of autoimmune disorders, most of which damage the blood cells. Some of the autoimmune disorders associated with ALPS can also damage the kidneys, liver, eyes, nerves, or connective tissues. Symptoms may include skin rashes, panniculitis, arthritis, inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), mouth sores, premature ovarian failure, and the development of neurological damage. ALPS is caused by genetic changes in the FAS gene in most cases. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although a small number of cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Some cases are also believed to arise from a genetic change in the lymphocytes that is not inherited, but instead occurs during the course of an individual's lifetime. This type of alteration is called a somatic genetic change."
Summary of Non-A-E hepatitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Severe immune-mediated enteropathy: Severe-immune mediated enteropathy describes a variety of intestinal disorders that can range from a serious, early-onset systemic disease (IPEX; see this term) to a mild isolated gastrointestinal disease. In children it manifests with severe diarrhea and dehydration in the presence of characteristic antibodies (anti-enterocyte and anti-goblet cell) and in adults with chronic diarrhea, malabsorption and weight loss."
"Summary of Whooping cough: A rare bacterial infectious disease characterized by severe coughing paroxysms with inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting, caused by infection with Bordetella pertussis. After a variable incubation time, the clinical course progresses through a catarrhal stage with sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and mild progressive dry cough, a paroxysmal stage with the typical paroxysmal coughing, and finally convalescence. Disease duration is usually 2-3 months, often with milder presentation in adolescents and adults than in infants and children."
"Summary of Osteogenesis imperfecta type 1: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones. Osteogenesis imperfecta type 1 is the mildest form of OI and is characterized by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor trauma. Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. Affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height. Most of the genetic changes that cause osteogenesis imperfecta type 1 occur in the COL1A1 gene. These genetic changes reduce the amount of type I collagen produced in the body, which causes bones to be brittle and to fracture easily. OI type 1 exhibits an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Osteogenesis imperfecta type 3: Osteogenesis imperfecta type III (OI type III) is a form of osteogenesis imperfecta, a group of genetic conditions that primarily affect the bones. In OI type III, specifically, a diagnosis can often be made shortly after birth as fractures (broken bones) during the newborn period simply from handling the infant are common. Other symptoms vary significantly but may include severe bone fragility, bone malformations, short stature, dental problems (dentinogenesis imperfect), macrocephaly (unusually large head), hearing loss, and blue sclerae (whites of the eyes). OI type III is caused by changes in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Osteogenesis imperfecta type 4: Osteogenesis imperfecta type IV (OI type IV) is a type of osteogenesis imperfecta, which refers to a group of conditions that affect the bones. OI type IV is the most variable form of the condition with symptoms ranging from moderately severe to so mild that it may be difficult to make the diagnosis. Symptoms vary, but may include easily broken bones, mild short stature, dentinogenesis imperfecta, adult-onset hearing loss, and normal-to-grey sclerae (the whites of the eye). OI type IV is caused by changes in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia: Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia (GDD) is a bone dysplasia characterized by bone fragility, frequent bone fractures at a young age, cemento-osseous lesions of the jaw bones, bowing of tubular bones (tibia and fibula) and diaphyseal sclerosis of long bones associated with generalized osteopenia. GD follows an autosomal dominant mode of transmission."
"Summary of Osteogenesis imperfecta type 5: A moderate form of osteogenesis imperfecta characterized by increased bone fragility and low bone mass that clinically manifests with susceptibility to bone fractures of variable severity, metaphyseal changes at birth, short stature, dislocation of the radial head, mineralized interosseous membranes, hyperplasic callus (occurring more often during periods of more rapid growth), white sclera and absence of dentinogenesis imperfecta."
"Summary of Osteogenesis imperfecta, type vi: ""Osteogenesis imperfecta type 6 is a form of osteogenesis imperfecta which results in weakened bones that breaks easily. When viewed under a microscope, bone tissue has a distinct """"fish-scale"""" pattern. Individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta type 6 appear to be healthy at birth and usually do not have fractures until after 6 months of age. Osteogenesis imperfecta type 6 may be caused by genetic changes in the SERPINF1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."""
"Summary of Osteogenesis imperfecta, type vii: Osteogenesis imperfecta is a connective tissue disorder characterized by bone fragility and low bone mass. OI type VII is an autosomal recessive form of severe or lethal OI (summary by Barnes et al., 2006)."
"Summary of Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a disease that causes abnormal blood clots to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure. It can occur at any age and is often caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Genetic factors involve genes that code for proteins that help control the complement system (part of your body's immune system). Environmental factors include certain medications (such as anticancer drugs), chronic diseases (e.g., systemic sclerosis and malignant hypertension), viral or bacterial infections, cancers, organ transplantation, and pregnancy. In about 60% of aHUS, a genetic change may be identified. The genes associated with genetic aHUS include C3,  CD46 (MCP), CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR3, CFHR4, CFI, DGKE, and THBD. Genetic changes in these genes increase the likelihood (predisposition) to developing aHUS, rather than directly causing the disease. In most cases, there is no family history of the disease. In cases that do run in families, predisposition to aHUS is inherited in an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Primary angiitis of the central nervous system: Primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare form of vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) affecting the blood vessels that nourish the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. This condition can lead to narrowing and blockage of the blood vessels of the central nervous system which can eventually cause aneurysms, ischemia and/or hemmorrhage. The cause of this condition is unknown. Symptoms of this condition may begin suddenly or develop over time. Symptoms may incude headaches that do not go away, fever, rapid weight loss, confusion or forgetfulness, and general malaise."

"Summary of Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia: Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia is a genetic disorder of bone growth. The term âaxialâ means towards the center of the body. âSphondylosâ is a Greek term meaning vertebra. âMetaphyseal dysplasiaâ refers to abnormalities at the ends of long bones. Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia primarily affects the bones of the chest, pelvis, spine, upper arms and upper legs, and results in shortened stature. For reasons not well understood, this rare skeletal dysplasia is also associated with early and progressive vision loss. The underlying genetic cause of Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia is currently unknown. It is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia: Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia involves episodes of irregular jerking or shaking movements that are induced by sudden motion, such as standing up quickly or being startled. Cold, hyperventilation, and mental tension have also been reported to trigger attacks in some cases. The exact type of abnormal movement varies among affected individuals but may include prolonged muscle contractions, writhing motions, or fast, ""dance-like"" motions. One or both sides of the body may be affected. The episodes can sometimes be preceded by a crawling or tingling sensation in the affected body part and do not involve a loss of consciousness. Individuals with Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia usually begin symptoms during childhood or adolescence."
"Summary of Paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia: DisaeseName (PNKD) is a disorder of the nervous system that causes periods of involuntary movement. Common symptoms include irregular, jerking or shaking movements, prolonged contraction of muscles, chorea, and/or writhing movements of the limb. The movements may have no known trigger or be brought on by alcohol, caffeine, stress, fatigue, menses, or excitement. The familial form is caused by genetic changes in the PNKD gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
"Summary of Myelodysplastic syndrome associated with isolated del(5q) chromosome abnormality: A rare myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by macrocytic anemia (with or without other cytopenias and/or thrombocytosis), and with del(5q) occurring either in isolation, or with one other cytogenetic abnormality, other than monosomy 7 or del(7q). The bone marrow is typically hypercellular with erythroid hypoplasia and increased numbers of megakaryocytes, which show non-lobated and hypolobated nuclei. Myeloblasts constitute less than 5% of the nucleated bone marrow cells and less than 1% of the peripheral blood leukocytes. Auer rods are absent. Ring sideroblasts may be observed.

"Summary of Hemophilia B: Hemophilia B is a bleeding disorder that slows the blood clotting process. People with this disorder experience prolonged bleeding or oozing following an injury or surgery. In severe cases of hemophilia, heavy bleeding occurs after minor injury or even in the absence of injury. Serious complications can result from bleeding into the joints, muscles, brain, or other internal organs. Milder forms may not become apparent until abnormal bleeding occurs following surgery or a serious injury. People with an unusual form of Hemophilia B, known as Hemophilia B Leyden, experience episodes of excessive bleeding in childhood but have few bleeding problems after puberty. Hemophilia B is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern and is caused by genetic changes in the F9 gene."

Symptoms vary but may include delayed motor milestones; low bone mineral density for age; early loss of baby teeth (before age 5); bone and joint pain; short stature; a waddling gait; skeletal malformations; and/or unexplained broken bones. The forms of hypophosphatasia that develop during childhood are generally more mild than those that appear in infancy. Childhood hypophosphatasia is caused by changes in the ALPL gene and can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Idiopathic hypersomnia: Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a neurological sleep disorder that can affect many aspects of a person's life. Symptoms often begin between adolescence and young adulthood and develop over weeks to months. People with IH have a hard time staying awake and alert during the day (chronic excessive daytime sleepiness). They may fall asleep unintentionally or at inappropriate times, interfering with daily functioning. They may also have difficulty waking up from nighttime sleep or daytime naps. Sleeping longer at night does not appear to improve daytime sleepiness. The cause of IH is not known. Some people with IH have other family members with a sleep disorder such as IH or narcolepsy."

"Summary of Primary Fanconi renotubular syndrome: Primary Fanconi renotubular syndrome (also known as Fanconi syndrome or FS) affects the way the kidneys work. In FS, the kidneys do not properly absorb electrolytes and other substances into the body. Symptoms can begin at any age. They may include slow growth, fragile bones, frequent urination, and dehydration. Other symptoms include weakness, tremors, and fatigue. FS can occur as an isolated condition or as part of other diseases. Primary Fanconi renotubular syndrome may be caused by genetic variants in one of several different genes, and can be inherited in families. FS can also occur as part of another condition or as a side effect of certain medications and other environmental exposures. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and urine testing."
"Summary of Pulmonary agenesis: A rare, non-syndromic respiratory or mediastinal malformation characterized by unilateral complete absence of lung tissue, bronchi, and pulmonary vessels.

Presentation is highly variable including airway narrowing, stridor, respiratory distress, recurrent respiratory tract infections, and pulmonary hypertension."
"Summary of Treacher-Collins syndrome: Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a condition that affects the development of bones and other tissues of the face. The symptoms vary greatly, ranging from almost unnoticeable to severe. Most affected people have underdeveloped facial bones, particularly the cheek bones, and a very small jaw and chin (micrognathia). Other symptoms may include cleft palate, eye abnormalities, and hearing loss. TCS may be caused by genetic changes in the TCOF1, POLR1C, or POLR1D genes. When the TCOF1 or POLR1D gene is responsible, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, about 60% of autosomal dominant cases are due to a new genetic change in the gene and are not inherited from a parent. When the POLR1C gene is responsible, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In some cases, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown."

Summary of Retinoschisis autosomal dominant: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Renal pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1: Renal pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is a disorder of electrolyte metabolism characterized by excess loss of salt in the urine, failure to thrive and dehydration. Symptoms usually begin in the newborn period. Some adults who have renal pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 may have elevated aldosterone levels, but no history of clinical disease. Renal pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expression. It is caused by by genetic changes in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C2)."
"Summary of Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome: Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body, particularly the heart, face, skin, and hair. People with this condition also have developmental delay and intellectual disability, usually ranging from moderate to severe. The symptoms of CFC syndrome overlap significantly with those of two other conditions, Costello syndrome and Noonan syndrome. These syndromes belong to a group of related conditions called the RASopathies, which are distinguished by their genetic causes and specific pattern of features. It can sometimes be hard to tell these conditions apart in infancy. CFC syndrome is usually caused by a genetic change in the BRAF gene, but can also be due to a genetic change in the MAP2K1, MAP2K2 or KRAS gene. It is an autosomal dominant condition, but most cases are not inherited, due to a new genetic change that occursin the formation of the egg or sperm or shortly after fertilization."
"Summary of Minimal change disease: Minimal change disease is a kidney disease in which there is damage to the filtering units of the kidney (glomeruli). It is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Nephrotic syndrome is comprised of a group of symptoms including protein in the urine (proteinuria), low protein levels in the blood, high cholesterol and triglycerides, an increased risk for blood clots, and swelling. Other symptoms of this disease include weight gain and a foamy appearance of the urine. The cause of Minimal change disease is unknown, but it may occur following an allergic reaction or infection."
"Summary of Pelger-Huet anomaly: Pelger-Huet anomaly (PHA) is an inherited blood condition in which the nuclei of several types of white blood cells (neutrophils and eosinophils) have unusual shape (bilobed, peanut or dumbbell-shaped instead of the normal trilobed shape) and unusual structure (coarse and lumpy). PHA is considered to be a benign disorder in most instances, as individuals with PHA are typically healthy. PHA is caused by genetic changes in the LBR gene. It is suspected that genetic changes within the LBR gene are responsible for a spectrum of disorders including isolated PHA; PHA with mild skeletal symptoms; and Hydrops, Ectopic calcification, Moth-eaten skeletal dysplasia (HEM). It is important to distinguish PHA from acquired or pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly, which may be found in individuals with certain types of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Diagnosis is made based on characteristic appearance of white blood cell nuclei identified by a blood smear."
"Summary of Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase defici: 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3BHSD) deficiency is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a group of conditions that interfere with the body's ability to make hormones. People with this condition lack many of the hormones made in the gonads (testes or ovaries) and the adrenal glands. There are three types of 3BHSD deficiency - the salt-wasting form, non-salt-wasting form, and non-classic form. The salt-wasting form is the most severe type. Symptoms related to abnormal salt reabsorption (i.e. dehydration, poor feeding, vomiting) may begin shortly after birth. Males with any form of 3BHSD deficiency often have abnormalities of the external genitalia and are frequently infertile. Females with the condition may have slight genital abnormalities at birth, but often go on to experience irregular menstruation, hirsutism, and infertility as they get older. 3BHSD deficiency is caused by changes in the HSD3B2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

"Summary of Brody myopathy: Brody myopathy is a hereditary condition that affects the skeletal muscles (muscles used for movement). Symptoms typically begin in childhood and are characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening (myopathy) after exercise or other strenuous activity. These symptoms can worsen in cold temperatures and are usually painless, however, some individuals may have mild discomfort. Some cases of Brody myopathy are caused by genetic changes in the ATP2A1 gene. The cause of Brody myopathy for individuals not found to have an ATP2A1 genetic change remains unknown. Brody myopathy is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with a few reported cases of autosomal dominant inheritance."
"Summary of 46,xy sex reversal 2: 46,XY sex reversal 2 is a genetic condition where a person with XY chromosomes (typically male) has female physical characteristics. This happens because of a duplication of the NR0B1 gene on chromosome Xp21.3-p21.2. The duplication causes a dosage-sensitive male-to-female sex reversal. This means that the duplication of the NR0B1 gene on the X chromosome with normal sex determining region of Y (SRY) results in 46 XY sex reversal. The condition is inherited from the mother who has normal ovarian function. The duplication can cause growth failure, intellectual disability, and multiple physical or structural differences that are present at birth. The baby does not have a variation of DAX1, which would have caused lack of certain hormones. The condition is diagnosed through genetic testing."
Summary of Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency type 2: A very rare mild adult type of NAGA deficiency with the features of angiokeratoma corporis diffusum and mild sensory neuropathy.
"Summary of Fallopian tube cancer: Fallopian tube cancer develops in the tubes that connect a woman's ovaries and uterus. Fallopian tube cancer occurs when normal cells in one or both tubes change and grow in an uncontrolled way, forming a mass called a tumor. Cancer can begin in any of the different cell types that make up the fallopian tubes. The most common type is called adenocarcinoma (a cancer of cells from glands). Leiomyosarcoma (a cancer of smooth muscle cells) and transitional cell carcinoma (a cancer of the cells lining the fallopian tubes) are more rare. While some Fallopian tube cancers actually begin in the tubes themselves, Fallopian tube cancer is more often the result of cancer spreading from other parts of the body to the tubes. For example, the fallopian tubes are a common site of metastasis (spread) of cancers that started in the ovaries, uterus, endometrium, (the tissue lining the uterus) appendix, or colon. Women with Fallopian tube cancer may experience symptoms, although some affected women may have no symptoms at all. Symptoms of Fallopian tube cancer are often non-specific, meaning that they can also be signs of other medical conditions that are not cancer. Symptoms of Fallopian tube cancer can include: irregular or heavy vaginal bleeding (especially after menopause); occasional abdominal or pelvic pain or feeling of pressure; vaginal discharge that may be clear, white, or tinged with blood; and a pelvic mass or lump. Doctors use many tests to diagnose cancer of the fallopian tubes."

"Summary of Rippling muscle disease: Rippling muscle disease (RMD) is a rare condition that primarily affects the muscles. It belongs to a group of conditions known as caveolinopathies. Symptoms of the condition generally begin during late childhood or adolescence, although the age of onset can vary widely. It is characterized by signs of increased muscle irritability, including percussion-induced rapid contractions (repetitive tensing of the muscle), percussion-induced muscle mounding (""bunching up"" of the muscle), and/or visible rippling of the muscles. Fatigue, cramps, and/or muscle stiffness are common, especially after strenuous activity or exposure to cold temperatures. Some affected people may also have hypertrophy (overgrowth) of some muscles and an unusual gait. Rippling muscle disease can be caused by changes in the CAV3 gene. Inheritance is usually autosomal dominant, but can be autosomal recessive. In addition to RMD, CAV3 genetic changes can cause features of the other caveolinopathies, even within the same family. The other caveolinopathies are: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1C, isolated hyperCKemia, CAV3-related distal myopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."

"Summary of Familial expansile osteolysis: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by abnormal bone metabolism with bone pain, deformity, pathological fractures, early conductive hearing loss, and dental abnormalities. Focal bone lesions are typically found in the appendicular skeleton and consist of progressively expanding lytic areas, while generalized disordered bone modeling and altered trabecular pattern are the result of the multifocal, progressive nature of the disease. Age of onset is variable, mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of ADan amyloidosis: A rare, neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cataracts, hearing loss, cerebellar ataxia, paranoid psychosis and dementia. Neuropathological features are diffuse atrophy of all parts of the brain, chronic diffuse encephalopathy and the presence of extremely thin and almost completely demyelinated cranial nerves."
"Summary of Hypotrichosis simplex: Hypotrichosis simplex is a rare form of hereditary hair loss without other abnormalities. Affected individuals typically show normal hair at birth, but experience hair loss and thinning of the hair shaft that starts during early childhood and progresses with age. Hypotrichosis simplex can be divided into 2 forms: the scalp-limited form and the generalized form, in which all body hair is affected. The progressive thinning of the hair shaft is a typical feature of androgenetic alopecia. Hypotrichosis simplex can be inherited either as an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive trait. Some cases are caused by genetic changes in the APCDD1 gene on chromosome 18p11."

"Summary of Primary membranous glomerulonephritis: Primary membranous glomerulonephritis is a kidney disease characterized by inflammation of the structures inside the kidney that help filter wastes and fluids. When the glomerular basement membrane becomes thickened, it does not work normally, allowing large amounts of protein to be lost in the urine. Symptoms develop gradually and may include swelling, fatigue, weight gain, and high blood pressure. In many cases, the underlying cause of primary membranous glomerulonephritis is not known. Some cases are associated with other conditions (lupus), infections (hepatitis B and C), cancer or as a side effect of certain medications."
"Summary of Familial abdominal aortic aneurysm: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are aneurysms that occur in the part of the aorta that passes through the abdomen. They may occur at any age, but are most common in men between 50 and 80 years of age. Many people with an AAA have no symptoms, but some people have a pulsing sensation in the abdomen and/or pain in the back. If the aneurysm ruptures, it may cause deep, severe pain; nausea; vomiting; fast heart rate; clammy skin; and/or shock. The condition has multiple genetic and environmental risk factors, and may sometimes occur as part of an inherited syndrome. When more than one family member is affected, it may be considered ""familial Abdominal aortic aneurysm."""
"Summary of Okihiro syndrome: Okihiro syndrome is a disorder that affects the eyes and causes abnormalities of bones in the arms and hands. This condition is characterized by a particular problem with eye movement called Duane anomaly (also known as Duane syndrome). Other features include bone abnormalities in the hands (malformed or absent thumbs, an extra thumb, or a thumb that looks like a finger) and partial or complete absence of bones in the forearm. Together, these hand and arm abnormalities are called Okihiro syndrome. Okihiro syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the SALL4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Progressive pseudorheumatoid arthropathy of childhood: Progressive pseudorheumatoid disyplasia (PPD) is a disorder of bone and cartilage that affects many joints. It manifests between the age of 3 and 6 years with joint pain and progressive joint stiffness. Symptoms include stiff joints (contractures), short stature, and widening of the ends of the finger and toe bones as well as other tubular bones. Bony widening at the fingers' joints progresses leading to permanent bending of the fingers (camptodactyly). Spine involvement results in short trunk and hunching of the back (kyphosis). It may initially be mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, however people with this condition do not have the laboratory test results of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. PPD is caused by a genetic change in the WISP3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases due to complete IFNgammaR1 de: Immunodeficiency-27A results from autosomal recessive (AR) IFNGR1 deficiency. Patients with complete IFNGR1 deficiency have a severe clinical phenotype characterized by early and often fatal mycobacterial infections. bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and environmental mycobacteria are the most frequent pathogens, and infection typically begins before the age of 3 years. Plasma from patients with complete AR IFNGR1 deficiency usually contains large amounts of IFNG (147570), and their cells do not respond to IFNG in vitro. In contrast, cells from patients with partial AR IFNGR1 deficiency, which is caused by a specific mutation in IFNGR1, retain residual responses to high IFNG concentrations. Patients with partial AR IFNGR1 deficiency are susceptible to BCG and environmental mycobacteria, but they have a milder clinical disease and better prognosis than patients with complete AR IFNGR1 deficiency. The clinical features of children with complete AR IFNGR1 deficiency are usually more severe than those in individuals with AD IFNGR1 deficiency (IMD27B), and mycobacterial infection often occurs earlier (mean age of 1.3 years vs 13.4 years), with patients having shorter mean disease-free survival. Salmonellosis is present in about 5% of patients with AR or AD IFNGR1 deficiency, and other infections have been reported in single patients (review by Al-Muhsen and Casanova, 2008)."

"Summary of Arnold-Chiari malformation type II: Chiari malformation type 2 (CM type II) is a type of Chiari malformation in which both the cerebellum and brain stem tissue extend into the foramen magnum (the hole at the skull base for passing of the spinal cord). CM type II is usually accompanied by a myelomeningocele (a form of spina bifida that occurs when the spinal canal and backbone do not close before birth), which can result in partial or complete paralysis of the area below the spinal opening. While the severity of CM type II can vary greatly, it can potentially cause serious complications during infancy or childhood. The exact cause of CM type II is not known but it appears to be due to defects in the brain and spinal cord that occur during fetal development."

Summary of Herrmann syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits 1: Glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits 1 (GFND1) is a genetic disease that affects the kidneys. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that a person only needs to inherit one copy of the gene variant from a parent to develop the condition. People with GFND1 have too much protein in their urine (proteinuria), blood in their urine that can only be seen under a microscope (microscopic hematuria), and high blood pressure (hypertension) that can lead to kidney failure in adulthood (20 to 50 years of age). Doctors can tell if someone has GFND1 by looking at a sample of their kidney tissue under a microscope, and finding that the kidney is enlarged and has too much fibronectin (a type of protein). GFND1 is caused by a problem in a gene on chromosome 1q32."
"Summary of Androgenetic alopecia: Androgenetic alopecia is a common form of hair loss in both men and women. In men, hair is usually lost in a well-defined pattern, beginning above both temples and is usually referred to as male-pattern baldness. Over time, the hairline recedes to form a characteristic 'M' shape. Hair also thins near the top of the head, often progressing to partial or complete baldness. The pattern of hair loss in women differs from men (female pattern hair loss). In women, the hair becomes thinner all over the head, and the hairline does not recede. Androgenetic alopecia in women rarely leads to total baldness. A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing this condition. Genetic changes in the AR gene have also been associated with Androgenetic alopecia."
"Summary of Endolymphatic sac tumor: A low-grade papillary epithelial neoplasm (adenocarcinoma) with a slow growth pattern. The endolymphatic duct emerges from the posterior wall of the saccule (of the inner ear) and ends in a blind pouch, the endolymphatic sac.

Summary of Cluttering: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder: Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) is a rare condition that can affect a person's ability to hear. Although sounds enter the inner ear normally, signals from the inner ear to the brain are not transmitted properly. As a result, the condition may be associated with mild to severe hearing loss and poor speech-perception abilities (difficulty understanding speech clearly). ANSD can be associated with other neurological disorders such as Friedrich ataxia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. The exact underlying cause of ANSD is not completely understood. In many cases, ANSD occurs in people with no family history of the condition. However, the condition does run in some families suggesting that genetic factors may play a role in some cases."

The severity of the condition and the associated symptoms vary based on the size and location of the tumor and how quickly the tumor is growing. Common features include difficulty walking; loss of the ability to move one side of the body or face; vision or hearing problems; headaches (particularly in the morning); nausea and vomiting; unusual sleepiness; and behavioral changes. In most cases, the underlying cause of Childhood brain stem glioma is unknown. Certain genetic conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type I, are associated with an increased risk of childhood brainstem glioma."

"Summary of Neuroendocrine neoplasm: A neuroendocrine neoplasm (carcinoid tumor) is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that usually develops in the digestive (GI) tract (such as the stomach or intestines) or in the lungs. In some cases, a neuroendocrine neoplasm develops in another part of the body, such as the pancreas, testicle (in men), or ovary (in women). In later stages, symptoms may vary depending on where the tumor is located. Symptoms of a GI neuroendocrine neoplasm may only develop if the tumor has spread to the liver. The tumor may produce hormone-like substances that spread to the body and cause symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, such as flushing of the face and chest, diarrhea, and trouble breathing. People with a lung neuroendocrine neoplasm are less likely to have carcinoid syndrome, but may experience coughing, wheezing, or pneumonia. The tumor may also cause various symptoms if it has spread to other parts of the body. The cause of neuroendocrine neoplasms is unknown, but certain unavoidable risk factors may increase a person's chance of developing a neuroendocrine neoplasm."
"Summary of Primary central nervous system lymphoma: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (primary CNS lymphoma) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which cancerous cells develop in the lymph tissue of the brain and/or spinal cord. Because the eye is so close to the brain, primary CNS lymphoma can also start in the eye (called ocular lymphoma). The symptoms vary based on which parts of the central nervous system are affected, but may include nausea and vomiting; seizures; headaches; arm or leg weakness; confusion; double vision and/or hearing loss. The exact underlying cause of primary CNS lymphoma is poorly understood. However, people with a weakened immune system (such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) or who have had an organ transplant appear to have an increased risk of developing the condition."
"Summary of Myeloproliferative neoplasm: Myeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of slow-growing blood cancers in which the bone marrow makes too many abnormal red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets, which accumulate in the blood. The type of myeloproliferative disorder is based on whether too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are being made. Sometimes the body will make too many of more than one type of blood cell, but usually one type of blood cell is affected more than the others. There are 6 types of Myeloproliferative neoplasm: chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis (also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), essential thrombocythemia, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, and chronic eosinophilic leukemia."

"Summary of Medulloblastoma, childhood: A medulloblastoma occurring in children."
"Summary of Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease: Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases are a group of diseases of the blood and bone marrow in which the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells. These disease have features of both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders. In myelodysplastic diseases, the blood stem cells do not mature into healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets and as a result, there are fewer of these healthy cells. In myeloproliferative diseases, a greater than normal number of blood stem cells develop into one or more types of blood cells and the total number of blood cells slowly increases. The 3 main types of Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML); juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML); and atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia (aCML). When a Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease does not match any of these types, it is called myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-UC). Symptoms of CMML and JMML may include fever, feeling tired and weight loss. Symptoms of aCML may include easy bruising or bleeding and feeling tired or weak."

Symptoms of Pineoblastoma include a buildup of fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus), headaches, nausea, and difficulty with eye movement. The cause of Pineoblastoma is unknown, but specific inherited genetic variants in two genes, RB1 and DICER1 can increase the risk for a Pineoblastoma. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and imaging studies. In addition, a biopsy is often done to examine a small piece of tumor tissue under the microscope."
"Summary of Pituitary carcinoma: A rare pituitary tumor characterized by the presence of a pituitary adenoma that has metastasized either within the central nervous system, or to distant sites. The vast majority of pituitary carcinomas are hormonally active, most frequently with ACTH or prolactin production.

The cause of Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy is not completely understood."
"Summary of Eagle syndrome: Eagle syndrome is characterized by recurrent pain in the middle part of the throat (oropharynx) and face. Classic Eagle syndrome is typically seen in patients after throat trauma or tonsillectomy. Other symptoms may include difficulty swallowing, feeling of something stuck in the throat, tinnitus, and neck or facial pain. A second form of Eagle syndrome unrelated to tonsillectomy causes compression of the vessel that carries blood to the brain, neck, and face (carotid artery). This form can cause headache and dizziness. Eagle syndrome is due to a calcified stylohyoid ligament or an elongated styloid process. The styloid process is a pointed part of the temporal bone that serves as an anchor point for several muscles associated with the tongue and larynx."

Symptoms typically develop in infancy or early childhood, but in some cases they do not develop until adulthood. Symptoms generally are due to hemolytic anemia, low platelets (thrombocytopenia), and neurologic dysfunction. Symptoms of anemia can include fatigue, paleness, jaundice, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. Widespread thrombosis (abnormal clotting) can lead to problems with the nervous system (such as personality changes, headaches, confusion, and seizures), abnormal kidney function, heart problems, and gastrointestinal problems. Congenital TTP is caused by changes in the ADAMTS13 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive."

"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to glycogen debranching enzyme deficiency: Glycogen storage disease due to glycogen debranching enzyme deficiency (GSDIII) is an inherited disorder caused by the buildup of glycogen in the body's cells. This buildup impairs the function of certain organs and tissues, especially the liver and muscles. Symptoms typically begin in infancy and may include hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia (excess of fats in the blood), and elevated blood levels of liver enzymes; later symptoms may include hepatomegal and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). Some individuals have short stature and noncancerous (benign) tumors called adenomas in the liver. GSDIII is cause by genetic changes in the AGL gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. GSDIII is divided into types IIIa, IIIb, IIIc, and IIId. Types IIIa and IIIc mainly affect the liver and muscles, and GSD types IIIb and IIId typically affect only the liver."
"Summary of Severe achondroplasia-developmental delay-acanthosis nigricans syndrome: Severe achondroplasia-developmental delay-acanthosis nigricans syndrome is characterised by the association of severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans. It has been described in four unrelated individuals. Structural central nervous system anomalies, seizures and hearing loss were also reported, together with bowing of the clavicle, femur, tibia and fibula in some cases. The syndrome is caused by a Lys650Met substitution in the kinase domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (encoded by the FGFR3 gene; 4p16.3)."

"Summary of Pilomatrixoma: Pilomatrixoma is a benign (non-cancerous) skin tumor of the hair follicle (structure in the skin that makes hair). They tend to develop in the head and neck area and are usually not associated with any other symptoms (isolated). Rarely, Pilomatrixomas can become cancerous (known as a pilomatrix carcinoma). The exact underlying cause is not well understood; however, somatic changes in the CTNNB1 gene are found in most isolated Pilomatrixomas. Rarely, Pilomatrixomas occur in people with certain genetic syndromes such as Gardner syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. In these cases, affected people usually have other characteristic signs and symptoms of the associated condition."
"Summary of Andersen-Tawil syndrome: Andersen-Tawil syndrome is a type of long QT syndrome and is also considered a rare form of periodic paralysis. It causes episodes of muscle weakness, changes in heart rhythm (arrhythmia), and developmental abnormalities.

The cause of the remaining cases remains unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
Summary of Joubert syndrome with oculorenal defect: A rare subtype of Joubert syndrome (JS) and related disorders (JSRD) characterized by the neurological features of JS associated with both renal and ocular disease.
"Summary of X-linked sideroblastic anemia: X-linked sideroblastic anemia is an inherited disorder that prevents developing red blood cells (erythroblasts) from making enough hemoglobin. This disorder also leads to an abnormal accumulation of iron in red blood cells. The iron-loaded erythroblasts, which are present in bone marrow, are called ring sideroblasts. These abnormal cells give the condition its name. The symptoms of X-linked sideroblastic anemia result from a combination of reduced hemoglobin and an overload of iron. They range from mild to severe and most often appear in young adulthood. Common features include fatigue, dizziness, a rapid heartbeat, pale skin, and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Over time, more serious medical problems such as heart disease and liver damage (cirrhosis) can result from the buildup of excess iron in these organs. X-linked sideroblastic anemia is caused by genetic change in the ALAS2 gene. In rare cases, genetic changes are found in both the HFE gene and the ALAS2 gene, resulting in a more severe form of X-linked sideroblastic anemia. X-linked sideroblastic anemia is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern."
"Summary of Isolated polycystic liver disease: Polycystic liver disease is an inherited condition characterized by many cysts of various sizes scattered throughout the liver. Abdominal discomfort from swelling of the liver may occur. However, many people who have Polycystic liver disease do not have any symptoms. In some cases, Polycystic liver disease appears to occur randomly, with no apparent cause. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Sometimes, cysts are found in the liver in association with the presence of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (AD-PKD). In fact, about half of the people who have AD-PKD experience liver cysts. However, kidney cysts are uncommon in those affected by Polycystic liver disease."
"Summary of Loeys-dietz syndrome 1: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is characterized by vascular findings (cerebral, thoracic, and abdominal arterial aneurysms and/or dissections), skeletal manifestations (pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum, scoliosis, joint laxity, arachnodactyly, talipes equinovarus, cervical spine malformation and/or instability), craniofacial features (widely spaced eyes, strabismus, bifid uvula / cleft palate, and craniosynostosis that can involve any sutures), and cutaneous findings (velvety and translucent skin, easy bruising, and dystrophic scars). Individuals with LDS are predisposed to widespread and aggressive arterial aneurysms and pregnancy-related complications including uterine rupture and death. Individuals with LDS can show a strong predisposition for allergic/inflammatory disease including asthma, eczema, and reactions to food or environmental allergens. There is also an increased incidence of gastrointestinal inflammation including eosinophilic esophagitis and gastritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Wide variation in the distribution and severity of clinical features can be seen in individuals with LDS, even among affected individuals within a family who have the same pathogenic variant."
"Summary of Ovarian insufficiency, familial: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Autoimmune oophoritis: Autoimmune oophoritis is a rare cause of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). It happens when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the ovaries causing inflammation, atrophy and fibrosis. These changes stop the ovaries from working normally. The main symptoms of autoimmune oophorotis are irregular or absent menstrual period (amenorrhea) and symptoms related to ovarian cysts such as abdominal cramping, bloating, nausea and vomiting. Autoimmune oophoritis may occur as part of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type I and type II but has also been associated with lupus, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune conditions. The underlying cause of Autoimmune oophoritis is unknown. Diagnosis involves a special blood tests and imaging studies."

"Summary of Pseudodiastrophic dysplasia: Pseudodiastrophic dysplasia is characterized by rhizomelic shortening of the limbs and severe clubfoot deformity, in association with elbow and proximal interphalangeal joint dislocations, platyspondyly, and scoliosis. It has been described in about 10 patients. An autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested. Pseudodiastrophic dysplasia differs from diastrophic dysplasia (see this term) on the basis of clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings. Clubfoot can be treated by surgical therapy, and neonatal contractures and scoliosis can be relieved by physical therapy. Several of the reported patients died in the neonatal period or during infancy."
"Summary of Anaplastic oligodendroglioma: A rare glial tumor characterized by a grade III oligodendroglial tumour with focal or diffuse anaplastic features.

"Summary of Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders: Zellweger spectrum disorder (ZSD) is a phenotypic continuum ranging from severe to mild. While individual phenotypes (e.g., Zellweger syndrome [ZS], neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy [NALD], and infantile Refsum disease [IRD]) were described in the past before the biochemical and molecular bases of this spectrum were fully determined, the term \""ZSD\"" is now used to refer to all individuals with a PEX gene defect regardless of phenotype. Individuals with ZSD usually come to clinical attention in the newborn period or later in childhood. Affected newborns are hypotonic and feed poorly. They have distinctive facies, congenital malformations (neuronal migration defects associated with neonatal-onset seizures, renal cysts, and bony stippling [chondrodysplasia punctata] of the patella[e] and other long bones), and liver disease that can be severe. Infants with severe ZSD are significantly impaired and typically die during the first year of life, usually having made no developmental progress. Individuals with intermediate/milder ZSD do not have congenital malformations, but rather progressive peroxisome dysfunction variably manifest as sensory loss (secondary to retinal dystrophy and sensorineural hearing loss); neurologic involvement (ataxia, polyneuropathy, and leukodystrophy); liver dysfunction; adrenal insufficiency; and renal oxalate stones. While hypotonia and developmental delays are typical, intellect can be normal. Some have osteopenia; almost all have ameleogenesis imperfecta in the secondary teeth."
"Summary of Melorheostosis: Melorheostosis is a rare skeletal abnormality that causes abnormal growth of new bone tissue on top of existing bones. Signs and symptoms typically appear by late childhood or adolescence. Signs and symptoms may include deformity, contracture, chronic pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. In some cases, the overlying skin and soft tissue may show thickening, shininess, reddening or darkening, linear scleroderma, and/or swelling. The condition typically affects the long bones, and the legs are affected more often than the arms. Sometimes the small bones of the hand or foot are affected, and rarely, bones of the skull or trunk are affected. The condition is sometimes associated with other bone or connective tissue abnormalities. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical and radiological features, which are used to distinguish Melorheostosis from other bone disorders. Isolated Melorheostosis (with no other associated disorders) is typically occurs in people with no family history of the condition. Around half of cases of isolated Melorheostosis are due to acquired, somatic genetic changes in the MAP2K1 gene. These genetic changes are not inherited from a parent and occur randomly during a person's lifetime. In the remainder of cases, the cause is not yet known."

"Summary of Sixth nerve palsy: Sixth nerve palsy is a nerve disorder that occurs when the sixth cranial nerve is damaged. The disorder prevents some of the muscles that control eye movement from working properly. People who have sixth nerve palsy cannot turn the eye outwards toward the ear. Other signs and symptoms may include double vision, headaches, and pain around the eye. Sixth nerve palsy may be caused by many things, including stroke, brain aneurysm, diabetic neuropathy, trauma, infections, inflammation, tumors, migraine headaches or intracranial pressure."
"Summary of Superficial siderosis: Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system is a rare condition that primarily affects the brain. Signs and symptoms generally develop in adulthood and may include hearing loss and cerebellar ataxia. Some affected people may also experience seizures, memory impairment, bladder disturbance, headaches, back pain, and/or dysarthria. Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system is thought to be caused by bleeding into a portion of the brain called the subarachnoid space (the area between the brain and the thin tissues that cover the brain). This bleeding can have a variety of causes, such as trauma, a tumor of the central nervous system, arteriovenous malformations, or an unknown cause. Not all people who experience bleeding into the subarachnoid space go on to develop Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system."
"Summary of Glaucoma 1, open angle, a: Glaucoma is a group of eye disorders in which the optic nerves connecting the eyes and the brain are progressively damaged. This damage can lead to reduction in side (peripheral) vision and eventual blindness. Other signs and symptoms may include bulging eyes, excessive tearing, and abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia). The term \""early-onset glaucoma\"" may be used when the disorder appears before the age of 40.In most people with glaucoma, the damage to the optic nerves is caused by increased pressure within the eyes (intraocular pressure). Intraocular pressure depends on a balance between fluid entering and leaving the eyes.Usually glaucoma develops in older adults, in whom the risk of developing the disorder may be affected by a variety of medical conditions including high blood pressure (hypertension) and diabetes mellitus, as well as family history. The risk of early-onset glaucoma depends mainly on heredity.Structural abnormalities that impede fluid drainage in the eye may be present at birth and usually become apparent during the first year of life. Such abnormalities may be part of a genetic disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. If glaucoma appears before the age of 5 without other associated abnormalities, it is called primary congenital glaucoma.Other individuals experience early onset of primary open-angle glaucoma, the most common adult form of glaucoma. If primary open-angle glaucoma develops during childhood or early adulthood, it is called juvenile open-angle glaucoma."

"Summary of CD3 deficiency: Immunodeficiency-17 is an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized by highly variable clinical severity. Some patients have onset of severe recurrent infections in early infancy that may be lethal, whereas others may be only mildly affected or essentially asymptomatic into young adulthood. More severely affected patients may have evidence of autoimmune disease or enteropathy. The immunologic pattern is similar among patients, showing partial T-cell lymphopenia, particularly of cytotoxic CD8 (see 186910)-positive cells, decreased amounts of the CD3 complex, and impaired proliferative responses to T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent stimuli. B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and immunoglobulins are usually normal. Although thymic output of functional naive T cells early in life is decreased, polyclonal expansion of functional memory T cells is substantial.

Summary of Polyomavirus allograft nephropathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a complication of transplantation in which there is uncontrolled growth of lymphocytes. It occurs in people whose immune systems have been intentionally suppressed due to having a solid organ transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The severity of PTLD can range from causing a mild, noncancerous (benign) overgrowth of tissue, to causing a life-threatening, cancerous (malignant) form of lymphoma. Common symptoms are often vague, such as feeling unwell (malaise), fever, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. Additional symptoms depend on the organs or body part(s) affected. The digestive tract, central nervous system, and/or transplanted organ are often involved. PTLD is often caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which infects lymphocytes called B-cells. Most people get EBV in childhood, but the virus becomes ""inactive"" because the immune system keeps it under control. In people with PTLD due to EBV, a weakened immune system may allow EBV to reactivate in infected B-cells, leading to their uncontrolled growth. In some cases, EBV from the transplant donor is reactivated in the recipient. PTLD can also occur if a recipient first becomes infected with EBV after the transplant. The reason that PTLD develops in people without EBV is not clear. PTLD is diagnosed by immunophenotyping a biopsy of an involved lymph node or other affected tissue. Additional tests such as blood tests, imaging tests, or bone marrow biopsy may be needed to determine the location(s) and extent of the disease in the body."

The changes seen in IBGC occur in the absence of calcium or parathyroid hormone (PTH; 168450) metabolic disorders, such as hypoparathyroidism (see 146200) or pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP; see 103580).See also the adult-onset form (213600), which is sometimes erroneously referred to as 'Fahr disease.'"
"Summary of Nystagmus 2, congenital, autosomal dominant: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Nystagmus 3, congenital, autosomal dominant: Classic congenital or infantile nystagmus presents as conjugate, horizontal oscillations of the eyes, in primary or eccentric gaze, often with a preferred head turn or tilt. Other associated features may include mildly decreased visual acuity, strabismus, astigmatism, and occasionally head nodding. Eye movement recordings reveal that infantile nystagmus is predominantly a horizontal jerk waveform, with a diagnostic accelerating velocity slow phase. However, pendular and triangular waveforms may also be present. The nystagmus may rarely be vertical. As these patients often have normal visual acuity, it is presumed that the nystagmus represents a primary defect in the parts of the brain responsible for ocular motor control; thus the disorder has sometimes been termed 'congenital motor nystagmus' (Tarpey et al., 2006; Shiels et al., 2007).For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of congenital nystagmus, see NYS1 (310700)."

"Summary of Microphthalmia with cataract 1: Microphthalmia is an eye abnormality that arises before birth. In this condition, one or both eyeballs are abnormally small. In some affected individuals, the eyeball may appear to be completely missing; however, even in these cases some remaining eye tissue is generally present. Such severe microphthalmia should be distinguished from another condition called anophthalmia, in which no eyeball forms at all. However, the terms anophthalmia and severe microphthalmia are often used interchangeably. Microphthalmia may or may not result in significant vision loss.People with microphthalmia may also have a condition called coloboma. Colobomas are missing pieces of tissue in structures that form the eye. They may appear as notches or gaps in the colored part of the eye called the iris; the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye; the blood vessel layer under the retina called the choroid; or in the optic nerves, which carry information from the eyes to the brain. Colobomas may be present in one or both eyes and, depending on their size and location, can affect a person's vision.People with microphthalmia may also have other eye abnormalities, including clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract) and a narrowed opening of the eye (narrowed palpebral fissure). Additionally, affected individuals may have an abnormality called microcornea, in which the clear front covering of the eye (cornea) is small and abnormally curved.Between one-third and one-half of affected individuals have microphthalmia as part of a syndrome that affects other organs and tissues in the body. These forms of the condition are described as syndromic. When microphthalmia occurs by itself, it is described as nonsyndromic or isolated."
"Summary of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 13: Spinocerebellar ataxia 13 (SCA13) is a rare sub-type of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA), a group of neurological diseases that causes degeneration of the brain and spinal cord. The age when symptoms begin and the type and severity of symptoms of SCA13 can be different from person to person even in the same family. The childhood forms is often least progressive, but may also include mild to moderate learning problems, taking longer to learn to crawl, walk, or run (delayed development of motor skills), and seizures. The main symptoms of SCA13 include difficulties coordinating movements (ataxia), especially walking; abnormal eye movements (nystagmus); mild to moderate intellectual disability; and involuntary muscle jerks or twitches (myoclonic jerks). Other symptoms may include speech difficulty (dysarthria), difficulty eating (dysphagia), slowness of movements (bradykinesia), mild bladder problems, stiff and brisk deep tendon reflexes, and loss of the sense of vibration. SCA13 is caused by changess in the KCNC3 gene and it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Since the symptoms of SCA13 can be similar to other types of SCA, genetic testing is used to confirm the diagnosis."
Summary of Rud Syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Giant cell arteritis: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a form of vasculitis, a group of disorders that cause inflammation of blood vessels. GCA most commonly affects the arteries of the head (especially the temporal arteries, located on each side of the head), but arteries in other areas of the body can also become inflamed. The inflammation causes the arteries to narrow, resulting in poor blood flow. Symptoms when arteries in the head are involved may include a throbbing headache on one side or the back of the head, tenderness of the scalp, flu-like symptoms, and/or problems with eyesight. Symptoms when other arteries are involved depend on the location of those arteries. The cause of GCA is still being studied, but it is thought to involve the immune system mistakenly attacking the artery walls. Several genetic and environmental factors may increase a person's risk to develop GCA. GCA may develop with or after another inflammatory disorder known as polymyalgia rheumatica."
"Summary of Autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia type 13: A rare, pure or complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by progressive spastic paraplegia with pyramidal signs in the upper and lower limbs, and decreased vibration sense."
"Summary of Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma: A WHO grade I large cystic tumor that occurs almost exclusively in infants, with a prominent desmoplastic stroma having a neuroepithelial population consisting mainly of neoplastic astrocytes. It involves the superficial cerebral cortex and leptomeninges, and often attaches to the dura. Although clinically it presents as large tumor, it generally has a good prognosis following surgical resection. (Adapted from WHO)"
"Summary of Granular cell tumor: Granular cell tumors (GCTs) are soft tissue tumors that can occur anywhere in the body. They are thought to arise from the cells that surround and insulate the nerve cells in our body (Schwann cells). Most Granular cell tumors are benign (non-cancerous), although some may be locally aggressive. GCTs affect females more often than males and usually present as a solitary painless mass. A few individuals have multiple GCTs. In most cases, these tumors are located in the skin of the head and neck, especially inside the mouth, the tongue being the most common site. They may also occur in the breast, heart, pituitary gland, stomach, esophagus, genitalia, and upper respiratory tract. GCTs may be part of some genetic syndromes, such as LEOPARD syndrome and neurofibromatosis."
Summary of Actinic cheilitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Acute erythroid leukemia: A rare unclassified acute myeloid leukemia characterized by a proliferation of immature cells exclusively of the erythroid lineage without a significant myeloblastic component. Microscopically, the cells may be undifferentiated or proerythroblastic in appearance. Patients may present with pancytopenia with fatigue, infections, and mucocutaneous bleedings, as well as weight loss, fever, and night sweats. Prognosis is poor."
"Summary of Polyembryoma: Polyembryoma is a type of tumor that develops from the cells of the gonads (testes in men or ovaries in women). Such tumors are called germ cell tumors. Polyembryomas have a distinctive look because they are composed of many parts that are shaped like embryos, one of the earliest stages of a developing human during pregnancy. Symptoms of a Polyembryoma may include an unusual bump or mass in the abdomen which can cause pain in some individuals; puberty at an unusually young age (known as precocious puberty); or irregularities in a female's menstruation. The cause of Polyembryoma is not yet known."
Summary of Polymorphic reticulosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Bednar tumor: Bednar tumor is a rare variant of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), a soft tissue sarcoma that develops in the deep layers of the skin. Bednar tumor is also known as pigmented DFSP because it contains dark-colored cells that give may give the tumor a multi-colored (i.e red and brown) appearance. The tumor may begin as a painless, slow-growing papule or patch of skin. However, accelerated growth, bleeding and/or pain may be observed as it grows. The underlying cause of Bednar tumor is unknown. There is currently no evidence of an inherited risk for the condition and most cases occur in people who have no family history of the condition."
Summary of Rheumatoid nodulosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism: Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP) is a very rare movement disorder, characterized by the abrupt onset of parkinsonism and dystonia, often triggered by physical or psychological stress."
"Summary of Primary dystonia, DYT6 type: A rare genetic movement disorder characterized by dystonia affecting at first an upper limb, less frequently beginning in the head and neck region, before slowly spreading to other locations. The clinical spectrum, like age of onset, is variable with focal, segmental, or generalized distribution, but cranial involvement with speech difficulties and cervical involvement are typical, whereas lower limbs are often spared. With progression of the disease, many patients suffer from generalized dystonia while mostly remaining ambulatory."
"Summary of Odontoleukodystrophy: 4H leukodystrophy is a rare disorder that affects the brain and nervous system. People with this condition usually have dental problems such as delayed or abnormal development and arrangement of their teeth (dentition) or missing teeth (hypodontia). They may also have delayed or absent puberty caused by a lack of hormones that nornally regulate sexual devlopment and function (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). People with this disease also have a lack of primary myelin (a protective covering on nerves) formation called hypomyelinating leukodystropy, which can lead to neurodevelopmental delay or regression and progressive cerebellar symptoms such as problems with movement, balance, and coordination."
"Summary of Fundus dystrophy, pseudoinflammatory, recessive form: Pseudoinflammatory fundus dystrophy is a disease that affects the retina in the eye. There are two types of this disease: a dominant type and a recessive type. The recessive type is less common and usually starts earlier in life. It can cause rapid loss of vision and damage to the outer edges of the retina. The dominant type usually starts later in life and does not affect the outer edges of the retina. Both types of the disease can cause problems with color vision and dark adaptation. Scientists have found that both types of this disease is caused by a change in a gene called TIMP3. Both types of the disease are inherited from a parent who has the changed gene."
"Summary of Fetal akinesia deformation sequence: Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) is a condition characterized by decreased fetal movement (fetal akinesia) as well as intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), multiple joint contractures (arthrogryposis), facial anomalies, underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia) and other developmental abnormalities. It is generally accepted that this condition is not a true diagnosis or a specific syndrome, but rather a description of a group of abnormalities resulting from fetal akinesia. FADS may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in some cases and may sometimes be caused by genetic changes in the RAPSN or DOK7 genes."
"Summary of Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy: A rare skin disease characterized by urticarial papules and plaques with severe pruritus mainly on the abdomen, buttocks, and proximal thighs. The condition usually develops during the third trimester of the first pregnancy, although presentation in the postpartum period, which may also feature other types of skin lesions, has been described in some cases. The symptoms generally resolve within few weeks."
"Summary of Adenosarcoma of the uterus: Adenosarcoma of the uterus is a rare tumor of the uterus that typically originates in the lining of the uterus (endometrium). This type of tumor is characterized by both benign (noncancerous) and malignant components (low-grade sarcoma). Typical symptoms in affected individuals may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, an enlarged uterus, and tissue protruding from the external os (external opening of the uterus that leads into the cavity of the cervix). It is most common in post-menopausal women but can affect women of any age. Factors that may predisposed an individual to the condition include hyperestrogenemia (high blood estrogen levels), chemotherapy, or radiotherapy."
"Summary of Spastic diplegia cerebral palsy: ""Spastic diplegia cerebral palsy is a form of cerebral palsy, a neurological condition that usually appears in infancy or early childhood, and permanently affects muscle control and coordination. Symptoms include increased muscle tone which leads to spasticity (stiff or tight muscles and exaggerated reflexes) in the legs. The arm muscles are generally less affected or not affected at all. Other symptoms may include delayed motor or movement milestones (i.e. rolling over, sitting, standing); walking on toes; and a """"scissored"""" gait (style of walking). Babies born prematurely and with low birth weight are at a higher risk of developing cerebral palsy. The exact cause is often unknown. However, Spastic diplegia cerebral palsy has been associated with genetic abnormalities; congenital brain malformations; maternal infections or fevers; and/or injury before, during or shortly after birth."""
"Summary of Autosomal agammaglobulinemia: Autosomal agammaglobulinemia is a rare form of agammaglobulinemia, which is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by very low levels of immunoglobulins (proteins made by the immune system to help fight infections). People affected by this condition generally begin developing frequent and recurrent bacterial infections from about 6 months of age. Commonly diagnosed infections include lung infections (pneumonia and bronchitis), middle ear infections, conjunctivitis, sinus infections, various skin infections, and infections that are associated with chronic diarrhea. Autosomal agammaglobulinemia can be caused by changes in many different genes, including IGHM, IGLL1, CD79A, CD79B, BLNK, PIK3R1, and TCF3. In most cases, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. However, families with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported."
Summary of Rufous oculocutaneous albinism: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Parkinson disease 2, autosomal recessive juvenile: Parkin type of early-onset Parkinson disease (PARK-Parkin) is characterized by the cardinal signs of Parkinson disease (PD): bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. The median age at onset is 31 years (range: 3-81 years). The disease is slowly progressive: disease duration of more than 50 years has been reported. Clinical findings vary; hyperreflexia is common. Lower-limb dystonia may be a presenting sign and cognitive decline appears to be no more frequent than in the general population. Dyskinesia as a result of treatment with levodopa frequently occurs."
"Summary of Pseudoxanthoma elasticum: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, PXE, is an inherited disorder that causes calcium and other minerals to accumulate in the elastic fibers of the skin, eyes, and blood vessels, and less frequently in other areas such as the digestive tract. Symptoms may include growth of yellowish bumps on the skin of the neck, under the arms, or in the groin area; reduced vision; periodic weakness in the legs (claudication); or bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the stomach. A clinical diagnosis of PXE can be made when an individual is found to have both the characteristic eye findings and yellow bumps on the skin. Genetic testing may confirm the diagnosis. ABCC6 is the only gene known to be associated with this condition."
"Summary of Multicentric Castleman Disease: ""Multicentric Castleman Disease (MCD) is a rare disease that affects the lymph nodes and related tissues. It is a form of Castleman disease that is """"systemic"""" and involves multiple regions of lymph nodes (as opposed to unicentric Castleman disease, which involves a single lymph node or single region of lymph nodes). The signs and symptoms of MCD are often nonspecific, and are mild in some people but serious in others. Symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes in multiple regions,  fever, weight loss, nausea, rash, and/or an enlarged large liver and spleen. The disease is diagnosed based on the symptoms present, laboratory test results, imaging studies, and results of a biopsy of the lymph nodes which shows specific features when studied under the microscope. In some cases, MCD is caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) and is referred to as HHV-8-associated MCD. In other cases, the cause is not known and it is referred to as HHV-8 negative MCD, or idiopathic MCD (iMCD)."""
"Summary of Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1: Human T-cell leukemia virus, type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retroviral infection that affect the T cells (a type of white blood cell). Although this virus generally causes no symptoms, some affected people may later develop adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) or other medical conditions. HTLV-1 is spread by blood transfusions, sexual contact and sharing needles. It may be passed from mother to child during birth or breast-feeding."

Summary of Medial Medullary Syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Achromatopsia 2: Achromatopsia 2 is a condition that affects the color vision. Most people have complete achromatopsia which is characterized by a total absence of color vision (only able to see black, white and shades of gray). Some people may have incomplete achromatopsia which is associated with some color discrimination. Other common symptoms include reduced visual acuity, involuntary back-and-forth eye movements, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and hyperopia (farsightedness). Achromatopsia 2 is caused by changes in the CNGA3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Achromatopsia 3: Achromatopsia is characterized by reduced visual acuity, pendular nystagmus, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), a small central scotoma, eccentric fixation, and reduced or complete loss of color discrimination. All individuals with achromatopsia (achromats) have impaired color discrimination along all three axes of color vision corresponding to the three cone classes: the protan or long-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (red), the deutan or middle-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (green), and the tritan or short-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (blue). Most individuals have complete achromatopsia, with total lack of function of all three types of cones. Rarely, individuals have incomplete achromatopsia, in which one or more cone types may be partially functioning. The manifestations are similar to those of individuals with complete achromatopsia, but generally less severe. Hyperopia is common in achromatopsia. Nystagmus develops during the first few weeks after birth followed by increased sensitivity to bright light. Best visual acuity varies with severity of the disease; it is 20/200 or less in complete achromatopsia and may be as high as 20/80 in incomplete achromatopsia. Visual acuity is usually stable over time; both nystagmus and sensitivity to bright light may improve slightly. Although the fundus is usually normal, macular changes (which may show early signs of progression) and vessel narrowing may be present in some affected individuals. Defects in the macula are visible on optical coherence tomography."
"Summary of Oncogenic osteomalacia: Oncogenic osteomalacia is characterized by the development of a tumor that causes the bones to be weakened. This occurs when a tumor secretes a substance called fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). FGF23 inhibits the ability of the kidneys to absorb phosphate. Phosphate is important for keeping bones strong and healthy. Therefore, this disease is characterized by a softening and weakening of the bones (osteomalacia). The disease also results in multiple biochemical abnormalities including high levels of phosphate in the urine (hyperphosphaturia) and low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia). The majority of tumors that cause Oncogenic osteomalacia are small and slow-growing. These tumors most commonly occur in the skin, muscles, or bones of the extremities or in the paranasal sinuses around the head. Most of these tumors are benign, meaning they are not associated with cancer. The exact reason that the tumors associated with Oncogenic osteomalacia develop is not known. The disease is diagnosed when a person experiences clinical features such as bone weakening and hyperphosphaturia and a tumor is found by imaging of the body."
Summary of Anterior spinal artery stroke: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Hydroa vacciniforme: A rare photodermatosis characterized by the development of pruritic or painful vesicles in a photodistributed pattern in response to sunlight exposure. The lesions heal with permanent varioliform scarring. Ocular involvement, deformities of ears and nose, or contractures of the fingers may occasionally be observed. Systemic signs and symptoms are absent. The condition typically occurs in childhood and regresses spontaneously in adolescence or young adulthood."
"Summary of Hyperacusis: Hyperacusis is a hearing disorder that results in difficulty tolerating sounds that would not bother most people. This condition may occur due to many different causes, such as head injury, viral infections, or neurological disorders. In some people with Hyperacusis, sounds are perceived as being much louder than they would be by someone without this disorder. Some people may have emotional reactions to sounds, such as being annoyed or afraid. Others experience pain with low-level sounds. Another common symptom is ringing in the ears (tinnitus). People with Hyperacusis can have only one or different combinations of these symptoms."

"Summary of HHV-6 encephalitis: HHV-6 encephalitis refers to inflammation of the brain due to an infection with human herpesvirus 6. People who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation are at an increased risk for developing HHV-6 encephalitis. People with immune system disorders may also be at an increased risk for developing this infection. Symptoms vary, but often include confusion, anterograde amnesia (difficulty learning new information following the onset of amnesia), short-term memory loss, and seizures. Diagnosis often involves lumbar puncture, virus testing, and MRI. EEG's may also be recommended when seizures are suspected."
Summary of Laugier-Hunziker syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Congenital factor XI deficiency: Congenital factor XI deficiency is a bleeding disorder that interferes with the body's clotting process. As a result, people affected by this condition may have difficulty stopping the flow of blood following dental extractions, trauma or surgery. Women with congenital factor XI deficiency may also experience heavy menstrual periods or heavy postpartum bleeding. Highly variable bleeding patterns occur between different people who have congenital factor XI deficiency and within families. Bleeding risk can not be predicted by the level of factor XI (a clotting factor) in the blood. Although the condition can affect people of all heritages, it is most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Most cases of congenital factor XI deficiency are inherited and caused by changes in the F11 gene. In most cases the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. However, it may follow an autosomal dominant pattern in some families."
"Summary of Lipodermatosclerosis: Lipodermatosclerosis refers to changes in the skin of the lower legs. It is a form of panniculitis (inflammation of the layer of fat under the skin). Symptoms include pain, hardening of skin, change in skin color (redness), swelling, and a tapering of the legs above the ankles. The exact underlying cause is unknown; however, it appears to be associated with venous insufficiency and/or obesity."
Summary of Double nails on the fifth toe: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Mowat-Wilson syndrome: Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects many systems of the body. Symptoms may include intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, delayed development, and Hirschsprung disease. Other symptoms may include microcephaly, structural brain abnormalities, epilepsy, short stature, and defects of the heart, urinary tract, or genitalia. MWS is caused by a genetic change in the ZEB2 gene. It typically occurs for the first time in a person with MWS and is not inherited from a parent. Vary rarely, more than one child in a family will have MWS."
Summary of Isotretinoin-like syndrome: Isotretinoin-like syndrome is a phenocopy of the isotretinoin embryopathy.
"Summary of Miyoshi myopathy: Miyoshi myopathy is a type of muscular dystrophy characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy (wasting), mainly in the distal parts of the legs. The first symptoms typically begin in young adulthood (on average 20 years of age) and include weakness and atrophy of the calves (sometimes asymmetrically), leading to inability to jump, run or walk on tiptoes. Over a period of years, the weakness and atrophy typically spread to the thighs and gluteal muscles. The forearms may become mildly atrophic with decrease in grip strength. It is caused by variations in the DYSF gene. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. Diagnosis may be confirmed by blood tests results showing an elevation of the creatine kinase (CK) and genetic testing. Miyoshi myopathy is part of the group of diseases known as ""Dysferlinopathies"", which are caused by different genetic changes in the DYSF gene."
"Summary of Granular corneal dystrophy type I: Type I granular corneal dystrophy (GCDI) is a rare form of stromal corneal dystrophy (see this term) characterized by multiple small deposits in the superficial central corneal stroma, and progressive visual impairment, which may sometimes be severe."
"Summary of Lattice corneal dystrophy type I: Lattice corneal dystrophy type 1 (LCD1) is an eye disorder that affects the cornea, the clear outer covering of the eye. In order to see properly, the cornea must remain clear. In LCD1, a protein, known as amyloid, builds up in a layer of the cornea called the stroma. Symptoms usually become apparent in childhood or adolescence and may include separation of layers of the cornea (corneal erosions), decreased vision, photosensitivity, and eye pain. LCD1 is caused by genetic changes in the TGFBI gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."

"Summary of Schistosomiasis: Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic worms. Infection occurs through contact with contaminated water. The parasite in its infective stages is called a cercaria. It swims freely in open bodies of water. On contact with humans, the parasite burrows into the skin, matures into another stage (schistosomula), then migrates to the lungs and liver, where it matures into the adult form. The adult worm then migrates to its preferred body part (bladder, rectum, intestines, liver, portal venous system (the veins that carry blood from the intestines to liver, spleen, lungs), depending on its species. Schistosomiasis is common in many tropical and subtropical areas worldwide."
"Summary of Meesmann corneal dystrophy: Meesmann corneal dystrophy (MECD) is a rare genetic condition affecting the clear front covering of the eye (cornea). It is characterized by the development of multiple tiny round cysts in the outermost layer of the cornea (corneal epithelium). Over time, these cysts can break open (rupture) and cause irritation and erosions. Symptoms usually appear around adulthood and may include light sensitivity (photophobia), redness, and pain. MECD can be caused by genetic changes in the either the KRT3 gene or the KRT12 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."
"Summary of Kienbock disease: Kienbock's disease causes one of the bones in the wrist (lunate bone) to slowly break down due to low blood supply. This process is called osteonecrosis. Symptoms include pain, swelling, limited movement, and decreased grip strength. The symptoms usually start in adulthood, but can occur at any age. The underlying cause of Kienbock's disease is unknown. Diagnosis is made by imaging studies."
"Summary of Congenital patella dislocation: A rare congenital limb malformation characterized by permanent and manually irreducible lateral dislocation of the kneecap. It typically presents with flexion contracture of the knee, genu valgus, absent or dysplastic trochlear groove of the femur, external rotation of the tibia, and dysfunction of the extensor mechanism. The defect may be unilateral or bilateral and can occur as an isolated malformation, be associated with other malformations of the lower limb, or be part of a polymalformative syndrome."
Summary of Sakoda complex: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Ring dermoid of cornea: Ring dermoid of cornea is characterised by annular limbal dermoids (growths with a skin-like structure) with corneal and conjunctival extension. Less than 30 cases have been described. Transmission is autosomal dominant and mutations in the PITX2 gene have been suggested as a potential cause of the condition.
"Summary of Monomelic amyotrophy: Monomelic amyotrophy (MMA) is a rare disease that causes muscle weakness in the upper extremities. MMA affects the lower motor neurons. Lower motor neurons are cells that help communicate information from the brain to the muscles that are involved in movement (skeletal muscles). Specifically, Monomelic amyotrophy causes weakness and loss of muscle mass in the arms and fingers. The disease is most common in Asia, especially in Japan and India. Males are more likely to develop the disease than females. The exact cause of Monomelic amyotrophy is unknown. Monomelic amyotrophy can sometimes run in families, but it is not thought to be caused by a specific genetic change. Diagnosis of the disease is based on imaging studies and electromyography (EMG) consistent with the disease."
"Summary of Recombinant 8 syndrome: Recombinant chromosome 8 syndrome is a condition that involves heart and urinary tract abnormalities,  intellectual disability, and a distinctive facial appearance. Most people with this condition are descended from a Hispanic population originating in the San Luis Valley area of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. Recombinant chromosome 8 syndrome is caused by a rearrangement of chromosome 8 that results in a missing piece of the short (p) arm and an extra piece of the long (q) arm. Most affected individuals have at least one parent with a change in chromosome 8 called an inversion."
"Summary of Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine: Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL) is characterized by the calcification of the soft tissues that connect the bones of the spine, which may lead to compression of the spinal cord. Many affected people do not have any symptoms, while others may experience mild pain or numbness in the arms and/or legs. In some cases, OPLL may be associated with other conditions such as genetic diseases (i.e. hypophosphatemic rickets), endocrine disorders (i.e. acromegaly, hypoparathyroidism), spondyloarthropathies (i.e. ankylosing spondylitis), and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. OPLL is most commonly diagnosed in men, people of Asian descent and people over age 50. The exact underlying cause is currently unknown."
"Summary of LCAD deficiency: A genetic disorder characterized by deficiency of the enzyme long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase that metabolizes long-chain fatty acids. Signs and symptoms appear in infancy or childhood and may be triggered during fasting, illness or exercise. They include hypoglycemia, muscle weakness and lethargy."
"Summary of Spinal intradural arachnoid cysts: Spinal intradural arachnoid cysts are cerebrospinal fluid-filled sacs that are located between the spinal cord and the arachnoid membrane (one of the three membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord). The symptoms vary based on the size and location of the cysts. Some affected people may have no suspicious symptoms while others experience progressive back and leg pain; tingling or numbness in the hands or feet; weakness of the legs; and involuntary muscle spasms (spasticity) that result in slow, stiff movements of the legs. When present, symptoms usually occur when the cysts compress the spinal cord or other nearby nerves. Spinal intradural arachnoid cysts are often present at birth and are caused by developmental abnormalities in the spinal cord that occur during the pregnancy. They can also result from a previous infection or injury and develop later in life."

"Summary of Littoral cell angioma of the spleen: Littoral cell angioma of the spleen (LCA) is a very rare, vascular tumor of the spleen. Most reported cases have been non-cancerous (benign). In many cases, LCA does not cause any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include abdominal pain, an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), anemia, or thrombocytopenia. It may be discovered due to abdominal pain or by accident (incidentally) when having a physical exam or during tests performed for other reasons. LCA affects men and women equally and can occur at any age, but it mostly occurs in middle-aged adults and occasionally in children. LCA is difficult to diagnose with imaging studies because of its similar appearance to other types of benign and malignant tumors.. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by biopsy or pathological evaluation of removed tumor tissue."
"Summary of Griscelli syndrome type 3: Griscelli syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by unusually light (hypopigmented) skin and light silvery-gray hair starting in infancy. Researchers have identified three types of this disorder, which are distinguished by their genetic cause and pattern of signs and symptoms.Griscelli syndrome type 1 involves severe problems with brain function in addition to the distinctive skin and hair coloring. Affected individuals typically have delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and eye and vision abnormalities. Another condition called Elejalde disease has many of the same signs and symptoms, and some researchers have proposed that Griscelli syndrome type 1 and Elejalde disease are actually the same disorder.People with Griscelli syndrome type 2 have immune system abnormalities in addition to having hypopigmented skin and hair. Affected individuals are prone to recurrent infections. They also develop an immune condition called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), in which the immune system produces too many activated immune cells called T-lymphocytes and macrophages (histiocytes). Overactivity of these cells can damage organs and tissues throughout the body, causing life-threatening complications if the condition is untreated. People with Griscelli syndrome type 2 do not have the neurological abnormalities of type 1.Unusually light skin and hair coloring are the only features of Griscelli syndrome type 3. People with this form of the disorder do not have neurological abnormalities or immune system problems."

Summary of Left-sided gallbladder: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Fibrocartilaginous embolism: Fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE) is a rare type of embolism (sudden blocking of an artery) that occurs in the spinal cord. FCE occurs when materials that are usually found within the vertebral disc of the spine enter into the nearby vascular system (veins and arteries) and block one of the spinal cord vessels. The symptoms of FCE often develop after a minor or even unnoticed 'triggering event' such as lifting, straining, or falling. Symptoms of FCE may include neck and/or back pain, progressive muscle weakness, and paralysis. The exact underlying cause of FCE is poorly understood. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the disease. Diagnosis is based on imaging of the spinal cord and ruling out other causes of a blockage of the vascular system within the spinal cord."

It is characterized by prolonged muscle tensing (myotonia) as well as muscle weakness, pain, and stiffness. Signs and symptoms usually develop during a person's twenties or thirties. Muscles in the neck, fingers, elbows, and hips are typically affected; facial and ankle muscles are less commonly involved. The severity of proximal myotonic myopathy varies widely among affected people, even among family members. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by genetic changes in the CNBP gene."
"Summary of Autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia type 29: A complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by a spastic paraplegia presenting in adolescence, associated with the additional manifestations of sensorial hearing impairment due to auditory neuropathy and persistent vomiting due to a hiatal or paraesophageal hernia."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to LAMP-2 deficiency: Glycogen storage disease due to LAMP-2 deficiency (Danon disease) is a rare genetic condition characterized by weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), weakening of the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles myopathy), and intellectual disability. This condition is a type of lysosomal storage disorder. Lysosomes are compartments within the cell that use enzymes to break down large molecules into smaller ones that the cell can use. In Danon disease there is a defect in the wall (membrane) of the lysosome. The defect is caused by variations in the LAMP2 gene. Danon disease is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. In this type of inheritance, males tend to be more severely affected than females and develop symptoms at a younger age."
"Summary of Bobble-head doll syndrome: Bobble-head doll syndrome (BHDS) is a rare neurological condition that is typically first seen in childhood. The signs and symptoms of BHDS include characteristic up and down head movements that increase during walking and excitement and decrease during concentration. Although the specific cause of this condition is unknown, BHDS is often seen with cysts in the third ventricle of the brain that also cause hydrocephalus (water on the brain)."
"Summary of Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy: Epithelial basement membrane corneal dystrophy (EBMD), also called map-dot-fingerprint dystrophy, is an eye condition that affects the cornea. The epithelium is the cornea's outermost layer, and the basement membrane is the layer that the epithelium attaches to. EBMD occurs when the epithelial basement membrane develops abnormally, resulting in folds in the tissue. Most people with EBMD do not have symptoms and may not be aware they have EBMD. Those who do have symptoms may have mild to severe blurry vision and pain, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, and a feeling that something is in the eye. The main cause of symptoms is recurring development of erosions in the cornea. EBMD usually affects both eyes. EBMD usually is not inherited, occurring randomly in people with no family history of EBMD. However, familial cases with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported. In some people with EBMD, a genetic change in the TGFBI gene has been identified as the cause. However in most cases, the cause remains unknown."
"Summary of Ichthyosis, congenital, autosomal recessive 4a: Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) is a group of skin disorders that cause unusual skin scaling all over the body. There are two main types of ARCI: lamellar ichthyosis (LI) and nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE). These disorders affect only the skin, and about two-thirds of patients have severe symptoms. However, there can be some overlap in symptoms between patients or within the same patient's family. NCIE is characterized by red skin and white, superficial scales that stick to the skin. Most patients are born with a collodion membrane and have thick skin on the palms and soles of the feet, which can cause pain and loss of pulp volume. Nail problems are common and some patients may experience other issues such as ectropion (eyelids that turn outwards), eclabium (lips that turn outwards), scalp involvement, and loss of eyebrows and lashes. 
LI is characterized by large, dark, and colored scales with no redness. The scales can be found all over the body, and the skin may be less good at protecting the body. As patients age, the scales can cover the entire body surface, including the folds of their skin, and can vary in size and color. Some patients may also experience hair loss and reduced sweating. ARCI is caused by variation in several genes, and it is an inherited condition."
"Summary of Ichthyosis, congenital, autosomal recessive 5: Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) is a group of skin disorders that cause unusual scaling of the skin all over the body. There are two main types of ARCI: lamellar ichthyosis (LI) and nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE). Both types cause scaling of the skin, but LI causes dark colored scales with no skin redness, while NCIE causes fine white scales with red skin. Both types can cause problems with the skin's ability to act as a barrier and can lead to other skin problems like painful cracks on the hands and feet. ARCI can also cause hair loss and difficulty sweating. It is caused by changes in genes that affect the skin's ability to develop normally."
"Summary of Ichthyosis lamellar, autosomal dominant: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Congenital non-bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma: Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE) is a specific type of ichthyosis mainly affecting the skin. Most infants with NBCIE are born with a tight, shiny covering on their skin, called a collodion membrane, which is typically shed within a few weeks. Other signs and symptoms include redness of the skin (erythroderma); fine, white scales on the skin; and thickening of the skin on the palms and soles of feet (palmoplantar keratoderma). Some people with NBCIE also have outward turning eyelids (ectropion); outward turning lips (eclabium); and nails that do not grow normally (nail dystrophy). NBCIE may be caused by genetic changes in any one of at least three genes: ALOX12B, ALOXE3 or NIPAL4. In some people with NBCIE, the cause of the disorder is unknown."
"Summary of Epidermolysis bullosa simplex with mottled pigmentation: Epidermolysis bullosa simplex with mottled pigmentation is a rare form of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). EB is a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Erosions and blisters form in response to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. In EB simplex with mottled pigmentation, blistering may begin at birth. People with this condition have a mottled appearance of their skin (ie., darker and lighter colored spots of skin). Their skin may seem to age more quickly and bruise easily. EB simplex with mottled pigmentation is caused by a genetic change in the keratin-5 gene (KRT5) and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."
"Summary of Kyrle disease: Kyrle disease is rare condition that affects the skin. The main symptoms involves the developing large papules with central keratin (a protein found in the skin, hair and nails) plugs throughout their body. These lesions are typically not painful but may cause severe itching. The cause of the disease is currently unknown. However, Kyrle disease is often associated with certain conditions such as diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, liver abnormalities, and congestive heart failure. In some families, the condition appears to be inherited but an underlying genetic cause has not been identified."
Summary of Xanthogranulomatous sialadenitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Familial atrial fibrillation: Familial atrial fibrillation is an inherited heart condition that disrupts the heart's rhythm. It is characterized by erratic electrical activity in the heart's upper chambers (the atria), causing an irregular response in the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles). This causes a fast and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). Symptoms may include dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or fainting. The disease also causes an increased risk of stroke.. While complications may occur at any age, some people never have associated health problems. Familial atrial fibrillation may be caused by changes in any of various genes, some of which have not been identified. It is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported."

"Summary of Systemic sclerosis: Systemic scleroderma is an autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and internal organs. It is characterized by the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the skin and other organs. The fibrosis is caused by the body's production of too much collagen, which normally strengthens and supports connective tissues. The symptoms usually begin with episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon. This may be followed by puffy or swollen hands before the skin becomes thickened and hard. The fibrosis can also affect internal organs, including the esophagus, heart, lungs, and kidneys."
"Summary of Limited systemic sclerosis: Limited systemic sclerosis (also known as sine scleroderma) is a type of systemic scleroderma that is characterized by Raynaud's phenomenon and the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) on one or more internal organs but not the skin. The exact cause of Limited systemic sclerosis is unknown. The fibrosis can affect internal organs, including the esophagus, heart, lungs, and kidneys. Internal organ involvement may be signaled by heartburn, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), high blood pressure (hypertension), kidney problems, shortness of breath, diarrhea, or impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (intestinal pseudo-obstruction)."

"Summary of Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 2: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type II (HHC2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by lifelong elevations of serum calcium concentrations with low urinary calcium excretion and normal circulating parathyroid hormone concentrations in most patients. Patients are generally asymptomatic, although pancreatitis or chondrocalcinosis may develop in some affected adults (summary by Nesbit et al., 2013).For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, see HHC1 (145980)."
"Summary of Leukonychia totalis: Leukonychia totalis is a nail condition characterized by complete whitening of the entire nail plate. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Less commonly, it may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, or acquired (not inherited) during a person's lifetime. The inherited forms can be caused by genetic changes in the PLCD1 gene and usually involve all 20 nails."
Summary of Hereditary koilonychia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Isolated congenital onychodysplasia: A rare isolated nail anomaly characterized by congenital unilateral or bilateral nail dysplasia (including micronychia, polyonychia, anonychia, hemionychrogryphosis, and malalignment) commonly involving the index fingers and/or other fingers or also toes, frequently associated with bony anomalies of the affected digits (such as Y-shaped bifurcation of the distal phalanx, brachymesophalangy, or syndactyly). The condition can be sporadic or familial."
"Summary of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome: Potocki-Shaffer syndrome is a gene deletion syndrome associated with deletions in a specific region of chromosome 11 (11p11.2). The characteristic features of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome include openings in the two bones that form the top and sides of the skull (enlarged parietal foramina), multiple benign (non-cancerous) bone tumors called exostoses, intellectual disability, developmental delay, a distinctive facial appearance, autism spectrum disorder, and problems with vision and hearing. In some cases, individuals with the syndrome may have a defect in the heart, kidneys, or urinary tract. The features of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome result from the loss of several genes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11. In particular, the deletion of a gene called ALX4 causes enlarged parietal foramina (openings in the two bones that form the top and sides of the skull), while the loss of another gene, EXT2, causes the multiple exostoses (benign bone tumors). Another condition called WAGR syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material in the p arm of chromosome 11, specifically at position 11p13. Occasionally, a deletion is large enough to include the 11p11.2 and 11p13 regions. Individuals with such a deletion have signs and symptoms of both Potocki-Shaffer syndrome and WAGR syndrome. A referral to an early childhood intervention and developmental-behavioral specialist and evaluation for vision and hearing problems at the time of diagnosis is recommended."

Signs and symptoms of CANOMAD may include loss of muscle, tendon, and joint sensation, abnormal gait (walk), ataxia, tingling sensation on the skin around the mouth or extremities, paralysis of eye muscles, difficulty swallowing and speaking, and rarely respiratory muscle weakness. This condition is caused by the presence of anti-diasialosyl antibodies in the body."
Summary of Aerobic actinomyces infection: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Paine syndrome: Mental retardation, microcephaly, spastic diplegia, seizures, and mild aminoaciduria are the principal features. Seemanova syndrome 1 and Paine syndrome are considered as variants of the same entity termed Paine-Seemanova syndrome."
"Summary of Proximal Xq28 duplication syndrome: Proximal Xq28 duplication syndrome is a severe neurological and developmental disorder. Signs and symptoms include low muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy, developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, and progressive spasticity. Other signs and symptoms may include recurrent respiratory infections and seizures. Some people with proximal Xq28 duplication syndrome may have autistic features, gastrointestinal problems, and/or mildly distinctive facial features. The syndrome is caused by having an extra copy (duplication) of the MECP2 gene, and inheritance is X-linked. The syndrome almost always occurs in males (who have one X chromosome), but some females with the duplication on one of their two X chromosomes have some signs or symptoms. Rarely, females may have severe signs and symptoms, similar to those in males with the syndrome."
"Summary of Human T-cell leukemia virus type 2: Human T-cell leukemia virus, type 2 (HTLV-2) is a retroviral infection that affect the T cells (a type of white blood cell).

"Summary of Parkes Weber syndrome: Parkes Weber syndrome (PWS) is a rare congenital condition characterized by a large number of abnormal blood vessels. The main signs and symptoms of PWS typically include a capillary malformation on the skin; hypertrophy (excessive growth) of the bone and soft tissue of the affected limb; and multiple arteriovenous fistulas (abnormal connections between arteries and veins) which can potentially lead to heart failure. There also may be pain in the affected limb and a difference in size between the limbs. Some cases of Parkes Weber syndrome result from genetic changes in the RASA1 gene, and are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In these cases, affected people usually have multiple capillary malformations. People with PWS without multiple capillary malformations are unlikely to have genetic changes in the RASA1 gene; in these cases, the cause of the condition is often unknown."
"Summary of Basal cell carcinoma, infundibulocystic: A rare type of basal cell carcinoma. It is characterized by multiple tiny cysts lined by infundibular epithelium."
"Summary of Rare lymphatic malformation: Lymphatic malformations or lymphangiomas are benign (non-cancerous) vascular lesions made of fluid-filled spaces (cysts) thought to occur due to abnormal development of the lymphatic system. In general, Lymphatic malformations are categorized into macrocystic, microcystic, or combined depending on the size of the cysts; they are also classified in superficial lesions known as lymphangioma circumscriptum, and more deep-seated lesions (cavernous lymphangioma and cystic hygroma). They are present at birth, although they may be discovered later in life. They are most commonly located in the neck and axilla, but they also occur in the mouth, arm, mediastinum, lung, leg, abdomen and viscera. Some may appear as a tiny blue or red spot while others are massive and affect an entire arm or leg. The signs and symptoms vary depending on the size and location of the mass; however, lymphangiomas can disfigure affected areas and disrupt the function of nearby organs or tissues. The exact underlying cause is unknown."
"Summary of Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy: Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is an eye disease characterized by infarction of the optic disk leading to vision loss. It can be nonarteritic (nonarteritic Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy or NAION) or arteritic, the latter being associated with giant cell arteritis (GCA; often termed temporal arteritis). Vision loss with both varieties is typically rapid (over minutes, hours, or days) and painless. Symptoms such as a general feeling of being unwell (malaise), muscle aches and pains, headaches over the temple, pain when combing hair, pain in the jaw after chewing, and tenderness over the temporal artery (one of the major arteries of the head) may be present with giant cell arteritis. At exam, visual acuity is reduced and the optic disc is swollen. In both subtypes, visual field examination is often reduced in the inferior and central visual fields. The visual loss is usually permanent, with some recovery possibly occurring within the first weeks or months."
"Summary of Epiphyseal dysplasia, multiple, 3: Autosomal dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) presents in early childhood, usually with pain in the hips and/or knees after exercise. Affected children complain of fatigue with long-distance walking. Waddling gait may be present. Adult height is either in the lower range of normal or mildly shortened. The limbs are relatively short in comparison to the trunk. Pain and joint deformity progress, resulting in early-onset osteoarthritis, particularly of the large weight-bearing joints."
"Summary of Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 4: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 4 is a multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with a late-childhood onset, characterized by joint pain involving hips, knees, wrists, and fingers with occasional limitation of joint movements, deformity of hands, feet, and knees (club foot, clinodactyly, brachydactyly), scoliosis and slightly reduced adult height. Radiographs display flat epiphyses with early arthritis of the hip, and double-layered patella. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 4 follows an autosomal recessive mode of transmission. The disease is allelic to diastrophic dwarfism, atelosteogenesis type 2 and achondrogenesis type 1B with whom it forms a clinical continuum."

Summary of Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 4: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a disorder of the liver that occurs in women during pregnancy. Cholestasis is a condition that impairs the release of bile (a digestive juice) from liver cells. The bile then builds up in the liver, impairing liver function. Symptoms typically become apparent in the third trimester of pregnancy and can include severe itching (pruritus). Occasionally, the skin and the whites of the eyes can have a yellow appearance (jaundice). ICP is additionally associated with risks to the developing baby such as premature delivery and stillbirth. The cause of ICP is largely unknown, although approximately 15% of cases are caused by genetic changes in either the ABCB11 or ABCB4 genes. Genetic changes within the ABCB11 and ABCB4 genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Symptoms of ICP are typically limited to pregnancy. Bile flow returns to normal after delivery and the signs and symptoms of the condition disappear, however, they can return during later pregnancies."

"Summary of Vibratory urticaria: Vibratory urticaria is a rare condition that is characterized by itching, reddish skin and swelling within minutes of local exposure to vibration. Areas of skin that are most exposed to the stimulus (often the hands) are generally more severely affected. People with this condition may also experience flushing, headaches, fatigue, blurry vision or a metallic taste in the mouth during episodes of skin involvement. Common triggers include mowing the lawn, riding a motorcycle, horseback riding, or mountain biking. Vibratory urticaria is caused by changes in the ADGRE2 gene and appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
Summary of Dermatofibroma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pilocytic astrocytoma: Pilocytic astrocytoma is an often benign, slow-growing tumor of the brain or spinal cord. The tumor may be in the form of a cyst and usually does not spread to nearby tissues. Symptoms vary depending upon the size and location of the tumor. Most symptoms result from increased pressure on the brain and include headaches, nausea, vomiting, balance problems, and vision abnormalities. The underlying cause of a Pilocytic astrocytoma is unknown. It most commonly occurs in children and young adults, and in people with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis."
"Summary of Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: A rare T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by a neoplasm of intraepithelial T-cells mostly occurring in the jejunum or ileum in patients with celiac disease.

Patients typically present with abdominal pain, malabsorption or diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes intestinal perforation or hemorrhage. Prognosis is generally poor."
"Summary of Dyssegmental dysplasia, Rolland-Desbuquois type: The dyssegmental dysplasias are lethal forms of neonatal short-limbed dwarfism. Handmaker et al. (1977) coined the term 'dyssegmental dysplasia' because of the marked differences in size and shape of the vertebral bodies (anisospondyly), which he attributed to errors in segmentation. Fasanelli et al. (1985) proposed that there are different forms of dyssegmental dwarfism, a lethal Silverman-Handmaker type (224410) and a less severe Rolland-Desbuquois type. The Rolland-Desbuquois form is lethal in about 40% of patients. Although many patients survive beyond the newborn period, all exhibit neonatal distress (summary by Hennekam et al., 2010)."

There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1990."
"Summary of T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia: T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia is a rare cancer of a type of white blood cells called lymphocytes. T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia causes a slow increase in white blood cells called T lymphocytes, or T cells, which originate in the lymph system and bone marrow and help to fight infection. This disease usually affects people in their sixties. Symptoms include anemia; low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) and infection-fighting neutrophils (neutropenia) in the blood; and an enlarged spleen. About one-third of patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. The exact cause of LGL leukemia is unknown. Doctors can diagnose this disease through a bone marrow biopsy, or by using a specialized technique in which various types of blood or bone marrow cells are separated, identified, and counted."

"Summary of Tukel syndrome: Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM) refers to at least eight genetically defined strabismus syndromes (CFEOM1A, CFEOM1B, CFEOM2, CFEOM3A, CFEOM3B, CFEOM3C, Tukel syndrome, and CFEOM3 with polymicrogyria) characterized by congenital non-progressive ophthalmoplegia (inability to move the eyes) with or without ptosis (droopy eyelids) affecting part or all of the oculomotor nucleus and nerve (cranial nerve III) and its innervated muscles (superior, medial, and inferior recti, inferior oblique, and levator palpabrae superioris) and/or the trochlear nucleus and nerve (cranial nerve IV) and its innervated muscle (the superior oblique). In general, affected individuals have severe limitation of vertical gaze (usually upgaze) and variable limitation of horizontal gaze. Individuals with CFEOM frequently compensate for the ophthalmoplegia by maintaining abnormal head positions at rest and by moving their heads rather than their eyes to track objects. Individuals with CFEOM3A may also have intellectual disability, social disability, Kallmann syndrome, facial weakness, and vocal cord paralysis; and/or may develop a progressive sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Individuals with Tukel syndrome also have postaxial oligodactyly or oligosyndactyly of the hands. Those with CFEOM3 with polymicrogyria also have microcephaly and intellectual disability."

"Summary of Developmental malformations-deafness-dystonia syndrome: Developmental malformations-deafness-dystonia syndrome (juvenile-onset dystonia) is a form of dystonia, which is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause repetitive movements and/or abnormal postures. The severity and frequency of the movements vary significantly; in some affected people, they may be barely noticeable while in others, the movements are severely disabling and painful. Dystonia can affect just one muscle, a group of muscles or all muscles of the body. Other signs and symptoms of the condition may include a tremor or other neurologic features. The underlying cause of developmental malformations-deafness-dystonia syndrome is poorly understood in most cases. Changes in the ACTB gene that are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner have been identified in some families with the condition."
"Summary of Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome: Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a rare form of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). In CAPS multiple blood clots form throughout the body over a short period of time (usually within a week). CAPS is a medical emergency, as clots can cause life-threatening multi-organ failure. The cause of CAPS is unknown. A widely accepted explanation is that it is caused by a combination of genetic changes (making one more susceptible to CAPS) and an environmental trigger, such as an infection, trauma, or surgery."

"Summary of Congenital disorder of glycosylation type I/IIX: Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are divided into 2 main groups: type I CDGs (see, e.g., 212065) comprise defects in the assembly of the dolichol lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) chain and its transfer to the nascent protein, whereas type II CDGs (see, e.g., 212066) refer to defects in the trimming and processing of the protein-bound glycans either late in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi compartments. Conventionally, untyped and unclassified cases are labeled 'CDG-x' (Orlean, 2000; Marquardt and Denecke, 2003).The phenotypes described in this entry most likely do not represent a single disorder, but have been referred by the authors as CDG-x and are included here pending further molecular characterization. In a review of CDGs, Marquardt and Denecke (2003) stated that more than 20% of CDG patients identified still cannot be ascribed to a known enzyme defect and are thus named CDG-x."
"Summary of B4GALT1-CDG: B4GALT1-CDG is a congenital disorder of glycosylation characterised by macrocephaly due to Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephaly, hypotonia, myopathy and coagulation anomalies. To date, only one case has been reported. The syndrome is associated with mutations in the GALT1 gene (localised to region q13 of chromosome 9) leading to a deficiency in the Golgi apparatus enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyl transferase."
"Summary of COG7-CDG: COG7-CDG is a congenital disorder of glycosylation characterised by dysmorphism, skeletal dysplasia, hypotonia, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, cardiac insufficiency, recurrent infections and epilepsy. To date, it has been described in two infants, both of whom died within the first three months of life. The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding COG-7 (chromosome 16), a subunit of the oligomeric Golgi complex."
"Summary of Primary familial polycythemia: Primary familial polycythemia (PFCP) is an inherited blood disease that causes uncontrolled production of red blood cells (erythrocytes). This leads to an increased volume of red blood cells compared to the total blood volume (erythrocytosis). It may also lead to increased total blood volume or increased blood thickness (hyperviscosity), both of which can cause symptoms. The disease is present at birth, but symptoms (if they develop) may arise any time during childhood or adulthood. Possible symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, nosebleeds, difficulty breathing after physical activity, muscle pain, a reddish complexion, and altered mental status. Some people develop blood clots that can block various blood vessels, preventing adequate blood flow (thromboembolic events). Most people have mild symptoms, but some people experience life-threatening complications such as heart attack or stroke. The risk of thrombosis and severe complications increases with age. PFCP is diagnosed by blood tests detecting isolated erythrocytosis and low EPO levels, in the absence of spleen abnormalities and other underlying diseases that can cause erythrocytosis (such as certain blood diseases and blood cancers). PFCP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but some people with PFCP have no relatives with the disease. In about 12-15% of people with PFCP, it is caused by genetic changes in the EPOR gene. However in most people, the genetic cause is not yet known."
"Summary of Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II: Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 2 (MOPD2) is a condition characterized by short stature (dwarfism), skeletal abnormalities and an unusually small head size (microcephaly).

Additional features include facial dysmorphism and necrolytic erythema of the skin. Biochemical hallmarks are decreased levels of glutamine in body fluids and chronic hyperammonemia. Death may occur in the early post-natal period due to multiple organ failure."
"Summary of Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome: Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome (GOSHS) is a very rare genetic condition characterized by a swollen, irritated colon (megacolon); characteristic facial features; a small head, and intellectual disability. Most people with GOSHS also are born with Hirschsprung disease, a condition in which the colon is missing nerve cells, leading to intestinal blockage. Some patients with this condition have a defect in the iris of the eye (coloboma), brain and other central nervous system abnormalities, an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) and short stature. This condition is caused by changes in the KIAA1279 (also known as K1F1BP) gene, and appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. GOSHS is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms and through genetic testing."
"Summary of Omphalocele syndrome, Shprintzen-Goldberg type: ShprintzenâGoldberg omphalocele syndrome is a very rare inherited malformation syndrome characterized by omphalocele, scoliosis, mild dysmorphic features (downslanted palpebral fissures, s-shaped eyelids and thin upper lip), laryngeal and pharyngeal hypoplasia and learning disabilities."
"Summary of Episodic ataxia: Episodic ataxia refers to a group of conditions that affect the central nervous system. It affects specific nerve fibers that carry messages to and from the brain in order to control body movement. The condition causes episodes of poor coordination and balance (ataxia). Episodes may last from a few seconds to several hours. During an episode, affected people may experience dizziness; nausea; vomiting; migraine headaches; impaired vision; slurred speech; and/or ringing in the ears (tinnitus). An attack may also cause seizures, muscle weakness, and/or paralysis of one side of the body (hemiplegia). Some people have several attacks per day, while others may have one or two per year. Episodic ataxia may be caused by a genetic change in any of several genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In some cases, the genetic cause is unknown."

"Summary of Catamenial pneumothorax: Catamenial pneumothorax is an extremely rare condition that affects women. Pneumothorax is the medical term for a collapsed lung, a condition in which air or gas is trapped in the space surrounding the lungs causing the lungs to collapse. Women with Catamenial pneumothorax have recurrent episodes of pneumothorax that occur within 72 hours before or after the start of menstruation. The exact cause of Catamenial pneumothorax is unknown and several theories have been proposed. Many cases are associated with the abnormal development of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus (endometriosis). Some believe that Catamenial pneumothorax is the most common form of thoracic endometriosis (a condition in which the endometrial tissue grows in or around the lungs). A diagnosis of Catamenial pneumothorax is usually suspected when a woman of reproductive age and with endometriosis has episodes of pneumothorax."

"Summary of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is a rare mild subtype of type I autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA type I; see this term). It is characterized by slowly progressive ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus."
"Summary of Hyperinsulinism due to short chain 3-hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: Congenital hyperinsulinism is a condition that causes individuals to have abnormally high levels of insulin, which is a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. People with this condition have frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma.The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur most often after periods without food (fasting) or after exercising, episodes of hypoglycemia in people with congenital hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating."

Multiple additional features may present, such as conductive hearing impairment, hypotonia, and connective tissue and urogenital abnormalities. Cognition is usually normal."
"Summary of Aortic aneurysm, familial thoracic 4: Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD) involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Familial TAAD affects the upper part of the aorta, near the heart. This part of the aorta is called the thoracic aorta because it is located in the chest (thorax). Other vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (arteries) can also be affected.In familial TAAD, the aorta can become weakened and stretched (aortic dilatation), which can lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Aortic dilatation may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection), allowing blood to flow abnormally between the layers. These aortic abnormalities are potentially life-threatening because they can decrease blood flow to other parts of the body such as the brain or other vital organs, or cause the aorta to break open (rupture).The occurrence and timing of these aortic abnormalities vary, even within the same affected family. They can begin in childhood or not occur until late in life. Aortic dilatation is generally the first feature of familial TAAD to develop, although in some affected individuals dissection occurs with little or no aortic dilatation.Aortic aneurysms usually have no symptoms. However, depending on the size, growth rate, and location of these abnormalities, they can cause pain in the jaw, neck, chest, or back; swelling in the arms, neck, or head; difficult or painful swallowing; hoarseness; shortness of breath; wheezing; a chronic cough; or coughing up blood. Aortic dissections usually cause severe, sudden chest or back pain, and may also result in unusually pale skin (pallor), a very faint pulse, numbness or tingling (paresthesias) in one or more limbs, or paralysis.Familial TAAD may not be associated with other signs and symptoms. However, some individuals in affected families show mild features of related conditions called Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. These features include tall stature, stretch marks on the skin, an unusually large range of joint movement (joint hypermobility), and either a sunken or protruding chest. Occasionally, people with familial TAAD develop aneurysms in the brain or in the section of the aorta located in the abdomen (abdominal aorta). Some people with familial TAAD have heart abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). Affected individuals may also have a soft out-pouching in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia), an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), or a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin (dermal capillaries). However, these conditions are also common in the general population. Depending on the genetic cause of familial TAAD in particular families, they may have an increased risk of developing blockages in smaller arteries, which can lead to heart attack and stroke."
"Summary of Colloid cysts of third ventricle: Colloid cysts of the third ventricle are non-cancerous brain lesions. The third ventricle is a cavity in the brain that is filled with cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Colloid cysts can cause blockages resulting in a build up of CSF in the brain (hydrocephalus) and increased pressure. Some colloid cysts are asymptomatic while others cause neurological symptoms, such as headaches, swelling of the optic nerve (papilledema), and drop attacks. While uncommon, symptoms of colloid cyst can become life threatening."

"Summary of Myasthenic syndrome, congenital, 2a, slow-channel: Congenital myasthenic syndromes (designated as CMS throughout this entry) are characterized by fatigable weakness of skeletal muscle (e.g., ocular, bulbar, limb muscles) with onset at or shortly after birth or in early childhood; rarely, symptoms may not manifest until later in childhood. Cardiac and smooth muscle are usually not involved. Severity and course of disease are highly variable, ranging from minor symptoms to progressive disabling weakness. In some subtypes of CMS, myasthenic symptoms may be mild, but sudden severe exacerbations of weakness or even sudden episodes of respiratory insufficiency may be precipitated by fever, infections, or excitement. Major findings of the neonatal-onset subtype include: respiratory insufficiency with sudden apnea and cyanosis; feeding difficulties; poor suck and cry; choking spells; eyelid ptosis; and facial, bulbar, and generalized weakness. Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita may also be present. Stridor in infancy may be an important clue to CMS. Later childhood-onset subtypes show abnormal muscle fatigability with difficulty in activities such as running or climbing stairs; motor milestones may be delayed; fluctuating eyelid ptosis and fixed or fluctuating extraocular muscle weakness are common presentations."

"Summary of Posterior column ataxia-retinitis pigmentosa syndrome: Posterior column ataxia with retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP) is a genetic condition that affects vision and the nervous system. It is characterized by a loss of cells in the light sensitive tissue in the back of the eye (retinitis pigmentosa), abnormalities in the body's unconscious perception of movement and spatial orientation (proprioception), and muscle weakness and breakdown (atrophy). Other signs and symptoms may include curvature of the spine (scoliosis), an abnormal bending of the joints in the fingers (camptodactyly), and issues with the gastrointestinal system. PCARP is caused by genetic changes in the FLVCR1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

"Summary of Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia: Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (CPL) is a rare developmental disorder that affects the lungs. It is present from birth and usually becomes apparent in the first few days of life with respiratory failure. It sometimes is apparent before birth with non-immune hydrops fetalis and pleural effusion (fluid in the lung). Infants with CPL often develop severe, potentially life-threatening, respiratory distress shortly after birth. They may also develop cyanosis caused by low oxygen levels in the blood, which causes the skin to have a bluish tint. Symptoms are due to abnormally wide (dilated) lymphatic vessels within the lungs. These vessels drain a fluid called lymph from different areas of the body. They are an important part of the lymphatic system, which helps the immune system protect the body against infection and disease. The underlying cause of CPL is unknown. It can occur as a primary or secondary disorder (due to another underlying condition). Primary CPL occurs as an isolated defect or as part of a generalized form of lymphatic disease affecting the whole body. Secondary CPL can occur due to a variety of heart abnormalities or lymphatic obstruction. Some cases of CPL have been associated with genetic disorders."
"Summary of Telangiectasia, hereditary hemorrhagic, type 2: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited disorder of the blood vessels. It can cause excessive bleeding. People with HHT can develop abnormal blood vessels called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in several areas of the body. AVMs on the skin are called telangiectasias. AVMs can also develop in other parts of the body, including the brain, lungs, liver, or intestines. A change in the ACVRL1 causes HHT type 2. It follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."

"Summary of Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy: Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) syndrome is a condition that mainly affects the digestive system and nervous system. Almost all people with MNGIE have gastrointestinal dysmotility, in which the muscles and nerves of the digestive system do not move food through the digestive tract efficiently and result in early satiety, nausea, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, vomiting after eating (postprandial emesis), episodic abdominal pain and/or distention, and diarrhea . Affected people may also have cachexia, dropped eyelids or weakness of other muscles of the eyes,  peripheral neuropathy (manifesting as tingling, numbness, and pain (paresthesias) symmetric weakness, that mainly affect the lower extremities) and hearing loss. Leukoencephalopathy, which is the deterioration of a type of brain tissue known as white matter, is a hallmark of MNGIE; however it does not usually cause symptoms in people with this disorder. MNGIE is caused by variations in the TYMP gene, important for allowing adequate levels of thymidine in the mitochondria. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the TYMP gene variations or the increased levels of thymidine and deoxyuridine in blood."
"Summary of Nasu-Hakola disease: Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD), also referred to as polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL), is a rare inherited leukodystrophy characterized by progressive presenile dementia associated with recurrent bone fractures due to polycystic osseous lesions of the lower and upper extremities."

"Summary of FG syndrome 3: FG syndrome is a genetic condition that affects many parts of the body and occurs almost exclusively in males. \""FG\"" represents the surname initials of the first family diagnosed with the disorder.FG syndrome affects intelligence and behavior. Almost everyone with the condition has intellectual disability, which ranges from mild to severe. Affected individuals tend to be friendly, inquisitive, and hyperactive, with a short attention span. Compared to people with other forms of intellectual disability, their socialization and daily living skills are strong, while verbal communication and language skills tend to be weaker.The physical features of FG syndrome include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), broad thumbs, and wide first (big) toes. Abnormalities of the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (the corpus callosum) are also common. Most affected individuals have constipation, and many have abnormalities of the anus such as an obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus). People with FG syndrome also tend to have a distinctive facial appearance including small, underdeveloped ears; a tall, prominent forehead; and outside corners of the eyes that point downward (down-slanting palpebral fissures).Additional features seen in some people with FG syndrome include widely set eyes (hypertelorism), an upswept frontal hairline, and a large head compared to body size (relative macrocephaly). Other health problems have also been reported, including heart defects, seizures, undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in males, and a soft out-pouching in the lower abdomen (an inguinal hernia)."

"Summary of Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia familial 2: Congenital hyperinsulinism is a condition that causes individuals to have abnormally high levels of insulin, which is a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. People with this condition have frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma.The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur most often after periods without food (fasting) or after exercising, episodes of hypoglycemia in people with congenital hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating."

"Summary of Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy). This condition gets its name from the areas of the body that are affected most often: muscles in the face (facio-), around the shoulder blades (scapulo-), and in the upper arms (humeral). The signs and symptoms of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy usually appear in adolescence. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy results from a deletion of genetic material from a region of DNA known as D4Z4. This region is located near one end of chromosome 4. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."

"Summary of Beriberi: Beriberi is a condition that occurs in people who are deficient in thiamine (vitamin B1). There are two major types of Beriberi: wet Beriberi which affects the cardiovascular system and dry Beriberi which affects the nervous system. People with wet Beriberi may experience increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and swelling of the lower legs. Signs and symptoms of dry Beriberi include difficulty walking; loss of feeling in the hands and/or feet; paralysis of the lower legs; mental confusion; speech difficulty; pain; and/or vomiting. Beriberi is rare in the United States since many foods are now vitamin enriched; however, alcohol abuse, dialysis and taking high doses of diuretics increases the risk of developing the condition. In most cases, Beriberi occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. A rare condition known as genetic Beriberi is inherited (passed down through families) and is associated with an inability to absorb thiamine from foods."

"Summary of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 28: Spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (SCA28)is a slowly progressive movement disorder that typically begins in early adulthood (but can affect children and older adults as well). Early signs and symptoms include problems with coordination and balance when walking (gait ataxia), speech and swallowing difficulties (dysarthria), over-reactive reflex reactions in knees and ankles (hyperreflexia), weakness in the muscles that control eye movement (ophthalmoparesis), uncontrolled movement of the eye (nystagmus) and drooping eyelid (ptosis). SCA28 is caused by changes in the AFG3L2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."
"Summary of Congenital primary aphakia: Congenital primary aphakia (CPA) is a rare eye condition that is present at birth in which the lens is missing. In some cases, CPA can be associated with other eye abnormalities including microphthalmia, absence of the iris, anterior segment aplasia, and/or sclerocornea (when the cornea blends with the sclera). This condition is thought to result from an abnormality during the 4th or 5th week of fetal development, which prevents the formation of any lens structure in the eye. Genetic changes in the FOXE3 gene have been associated with this condition. CPA is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Oligodendroglioma: Oligodendrogliomas are brain tumors arising from oligodendrocytes, a type of cell that makes up the supportive (glial) tissue of the brain. They can be low-grade (grade II) or high-grade (grade III, also called anaplastic). While they can be found anywhere within the cerebral hemisphere, they are most common in the frontal and temporal lobes. They are generally soft, grayish-pink tumors that often contain mineral deposits (calcifications), areas of hemorrhage, and/or cysts. Common symptoms include seizures, headaches and changes in personality. Other symptoms vary by the size and location of the tumor. The exact cause of opigodendrogliomas is unknown. Some appear to have a chromosome abnormality involving loss of chromosomes 1p and 19q."

Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are increased between episodes of myoglobinuria. Less than 50 cases have been described so far. The disease is due to an anomaly in one of the last steps of glycolysis. The enzymatic defect in glycogen storage disease due to phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency is caused by mutations in the cDNA coding for the M-isoform of PGAM. Residual PGAM activity in the muscles of patients (2%-6%) is due to activity of the B-isoform. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Differential diagnosis includes muscle phosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) and phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFKD) (see these terms)."
"Summary of Hypercoagulability syndrome due to glycosylphosphatidylinositol deficiency: A rare congenital disorder of glycosylation characterized by cerebral and portal vein thrombosis, portal hypertension, macrocephaly, and persistent absence seizures.

"Summary of Mandibuloacral dysplasia with type B lipodystrophy: Mandibuloacral dysplasia is a condition that causes a variety of abnormalities involving bone development, skin coloring (pigmentation), and fat distribution. People with this condition may grow slowly after birth. Most affected individuals are born with an underdeveloped lower jaw bone (mandible) and small collar bones (clavicles), leading to the characteristic features of a small chin and sloped shoulders. Other bone problems include loss of bone from the tips of the fingers (acroosteolysis), which causes bulbous finger tips; delayed closure of certain skull bones; and joint deformities (contractures).People with mandibuloacral dysplasia can have mottled or patchy skin pigmentation or other skin abnormalities. Some people with this condition have features of premature aging (a condition called progeria), such as thin skin, loss of teeth, loss of hair, and a beaked nose. Some individuals with mandibuloacral dysplasia have metabolic problems, such as diabetes.A common feature of mandibuloacral dysplasia is a lack of fatty tissue under the skin (lipodystrophy) in certain regions of the body. The two types of this disorder, mandibuloacral dysplasia with type A lipodystrophy (MADA) and mandibuloacral dysplasia with type B lipodystrophy (MADB) are distinguished by the pattern of fat distribution throughout the body. Type A is described as partial lipodystrophy; affected individuals have a loss of fatty tissue from the torso and limbs, but it may build up around the neck and shoulders. Type B is a generalized lipodystrophy, with loss of fatty tissue in the face, torso, and limbs.MADA usually begins in adulthood, although children can be affected. MADB begins earlier, often just after birth. Many babies with MADB are born prematurely."

Additional reported manifestations include seizures, mild brain atrophy, mild hypercholesterolemia and borderline hypoalbuminemia."
"Summary of Congenital chloride diarrhea: Congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD) is a lifelong condition that causes large, watery stools (diarrhea) that contain an excess of chloride. Those with CCD have diarrhea even before birth. Signs of CCD before birth may be detected with an ultrasound, and may include an increased amount of amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) and enlarged (dilated) intestinal loops in the fetus. Newborns with CCD are often premature and may have a swollen-looking abdomen (abdominal distention). For this reason, CCD is sometimes first mistaken for an intestinal obstruction. CCD causes electrolyte imbalances including low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) and chloride levels (hypochloremia). Electrolyte imbalances and severe dehydration can lead to volume depletion (too little fluid surrounding body cells), loss of acid from the blood (metabolic alkalosis), hyperaldosteronism, delayed growth and development, and kidney damage (nephropathy). CCD is caused by genetic changes in the SLC26A3 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. The diagnosis is based on detecting excessive chloride in the feces, when the newborn is in fluid and electrolyte balance."

"Summary of Frontotemporal dementia, ubiquitin-positive: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Familial progressive cardiac conduction defect: Familial progressive cardiac conduction defect (PCCD) is a is a cardiac (heart) conduction disorder that may progress to complete heart block. Affected people may not have any symptoms, or the condition may cause shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, abdominal pain, heart failure, or sudden death. Genetic changes in several genes, including the SCN5A, SCN1B and TRPM4 genes, can cause PCCD. Several other genes may be the cause when PCCD occurs with congenital heart disease. Familial PCCD is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, not all people that have the mutated gene will have the condition; in those that do, symptoms and severity can vary (known as reduced penetrance and variable expressivity). Autosomal recessive inheritance and sporadic cases have been reported, but are rare."

Summary of Red cell phospholipid defect with hemolysis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pellagra: Pellagra is a nutritional disorder caused by a deficiency in niacin (vitamin B3) or its precursor (tryptophan) that is mainly observed in Asia and Africa where it is generally due to poor nutrition. It is characterized by dermatitis (symmetrical photodistributed erythema that may be accompanied by vesicles and bullae, and that develops into hyperkeratotic and hyperpigmented skin), gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea), and neuropsychiatric disorders (dementia). It can be life-threatening without a correct management."
Summary of Priapism: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is an eye disease. It affects the thin layer of cells that line the back part of the cornea. This layer is called the endothelium. The disease occurs when these cells slowly start to die off. The cells help pump excess fluid out of the cornea. As more and more cells are lost, fluid begins to build up in the cornea, causing swelling and a cloudy cornea. Early in the disease, patients typically do not have symptoms. Over time, discomfort may diminish but severe impairment of visual acuity, and even blindness and cataracts in elderly patients, may be observed."
"Summary of Vagina, absence of: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Bruck syndrome 2: Bruck syndrome 2 is a condition caused by a change in a gene called PLOD2. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called telopeptide lysyl hydroxylase, which is important for the formation of strong bones and joints. When this gene is changed, it can cause problems with bone and joint development, leading to joint stiffness and skeletal abnormalities."
"Summary of Whistling face syndrome, recessive form: Whistling face syndrome is characterized by an atypical facial appearance with anomalies of the hands and feet. Most cases show autosomal dominant inheritance: see distal arthrogryposis 2A (DA2A; 193700). There are rare reports of presumably autosomal recessive inheritance (summary by Altunhan et al., 2010)."
"Summary of Anterior segment developmental anomaly: Anterior segment developmental anomaly (ASD) refers to a spectrum of disorders that affect the development of the front of the eye (the anterior segment), which includes the cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens. The specific eye abnormalities (alone or in combination) vary depending on the subtype of ASD and genetic cause, and some types may also be associated with neurological abnormalities. Glaucoma develops in approximately 60% of people with ASD, during infancy or much later. Specific eye signs and symptoms of ASD may include: Underdevelopment of the iris (iris hypoplasia). An enlarged or reduced cornea diameter. Growth of new blood vessels (vascularization) and opacity in the cornea. Posterior embryotoxon (a thickened and displaced Schwalbe's line). Corectopia (displacement of the pupil). Polycoria (more than one pupillary opening). An abnormal iridocorneal angle (the angle formed by the iris and cornea). Ectopia lentis (displacement of the lens). Aphakia (absent lens). Cataracts. Anterior synechiae (when the iris adheres to the cornea). Posterior keratoconus (thinning of the cornea). Individual disorders within the ASD spectrum include Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (which includes disorders formerly known as Axenfeld anomaly, Axenfeld syndrome, Rieger anomaly, Rieger syndrome, and iridogoniodysgenesis) and Peters anomaly. ASD may be caused by genetic changes in any of several genes and inheritance can be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive, depending on the responsible gene."
"Summary of Piriformis syndrome: Piriformis syndrome is a rare neuromuscular condition that occurs when the piriformis muscle in the buttocks presses on the sciatic nerve. The condition is primarily associated with sciatica; however, other symptoms may include tenderness, aching, tingling and/or numbness of the buttock and pain when sitting for a long period of time, climbing stairs, walking or running. Piriformis syndrome is caused by damage, irritation or overuse of the piriformis muscle which can make the muscle swell or tighten. This puts pressure on the nerve beneath it (the sciatic nerve) which leads to the signs and symptoms of the condition."
"Summary of Campomelic dysplasia: Campomelic dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the skeleton, reproductive system, and face. Symptoms of Campomelic dysplasia may include bowing of the legs, dislocated hips, small lungs and chest, and external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia). In addition, infants with Campomelic dysplasia have distinctive facial features including a small chin with cleft palate, prominent eyes, flat face, and a large head. Campomelic dysplasia usually results from a new genetic change (DNA variant) in or the near the SOX9 gene. Diagnosis is based on physical findings and x-ray (radiograph) findings and may be confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1: Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (BRIC1) is characterized by episodes of liver dysfunction called cholestasis, during which the liver cells have a reduced ability to release a digestive fluid called bile. These episodes can last from weeks to months, and the time between them, during which there are usually no symptoms, can vary from weeks to years. Most people with BRIC1 have their first episode of cholestasis in their teens or twenties. Symptoms often present with severe itchiness, followed by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) a few weeks later. BRIC1 is caused by genetic changes in the ATP8B1 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. BRIC1 generally does not cause lasting damage to the liver. However, in rare cases, episodes of liver dysfunction may develop into a more severe, permanent form of liver disease known as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). BRIC and PFIC are sometimes considered to be part of a spectrum of intrahepatic cholestasis disorders of varying severity."
"Summary of Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 2: ATP8B1 deficiency encompasses a phenotypic spectrum ranging from severe to intermediate to mild, based on an individual's clinical findings and laboratory test results, including liver biopsy. Severe ATP8B1 deficiency is characterized by onset of symptoms of cholestasis (pruritus and attacks of jaundice) within the first few months of life. Secondary manifestations such as coagulopathy (due to vitamin K deficiency), malabsorption, and poor weight gain may present earlier than age three months. Without surgical intervention, cirrhosis and evolution to end-stage hepatic failure and death usually ensue before the third decade. Mild ATP8B1 deficiency is characterized by intermittent episodes of cholestasis manifest as severe pruritus and jaundice; chronic liver damage does not typically develop. In contrast to patients in whom bouts of cholestasis are induced only by particular triggers known to increase risk of cholestasis (drug exposure, shifts in hormonal milieu [including those resulting from ingestion of contraceptive drugs or from pregnancy], coexistent malignancy), some or all bouts of cholestasis in individuals with mild ATP8B1 deficiency have different or unknown triggers."
Summary of Hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Sebaceous gland hyperplasia, familial presenile: Sebaceous gland hyperplasia presents as one or more elevated, soft, yellow papules with central umbilication on the face, particularly the forehead. Lesions may spread to the neck and upper part of the thorax. Sebaceous gland hyperplasia occurs frequently in older individuals, particularly in men past middle age (Nomland, 1930). A premature form has its appearance during puberty or just afterwards, male predominance, and excessive sebaceous secretion. Most cases are sporadic (summary by Boonchai and Leenutaphong, 1997)."
"Summary of Presenile dementia, Kraepelin type: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Aneurysm, intracranial berry, 2: Intracranial berry aneurysms are saccular outpouchings of the intracranial arteries, most commonly at arterial bifurcations, characterized by arterial wall remodeling. Most cases of ruptured intracranial berry aneurysms result in a subarachnoid hemorrhage, associated with high morbidity and mortality (summary by van der Voet et al., 2004).For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of intracranial berry aneurysm, see ANIB1 (105800)."
"Summary of Congenital trigeminal anesthesia: Congenital trigeminal anesthesia is a rare neuro-ophtalmological disorder characterized by a congenital sensory deficit involving all or some of the sensory components of the trigeminal nerve.

"Summary of Developmental prosopagnosia: Developmental prosopagnosia is a lifelong condition that impairs a person's ability to recognize faces, in the absence of sensory visual problems and intellectual impairment. People with this condition have normal intelligence and memory, typical low-level vision, and no history of brain injury. They typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style (gait) and hairstyle to recognize others. Symptoms that may vary include whether a person can perceive facial expressions normally, or recognize objects normally. The underlying genetic cause of Developmental prosopagnosia is not yet known. Familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Developmental prosopagnosia differs from acquired prosopagnosia, in which a person develops face recognition difficulties as a result of brain injury (for example, from a stroke or trauma)."
"Summary of Autosomal dominant compelling helio ophthalmic outburst syndrome: Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helioopthalmic Outburst (ACHOO) Syndrome is characterized by uncontrollable sneezing in response to the sudden exposure to bright light, typically intense sunlight. This type of sneezing is also known as photic sneezing. About one in four individuals who already have a prickling sensation in their nose will sneeze in response to sunlight, but âpureâ photic sneezing is far less common. Sneezing is usually triggered by contact with infectious agents or after inhaling irritants, but the cause of photic sneezing is not fully understood. It may involve an over-excitability of the visual cortex in response to light, leading to a stronger activation of the secondary somatosensory areas."
"Summary of Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies: A rare serpinopathy characterized by progressive myoclonus epilepsy and/or pre-senile dementia with prominent frontal-lobe features and relative sparing of recall memory. In addition, other neurological manifestations like cerebellar symptoms and pyramidal signs may be present.

"Summary of Glutathione synthetase deficiency: Glutathione synthetase deficiency is a genetic metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce an important substance called glutathione. People with Glutathione synthetase deficiency do not have enough of the molecule called glutathione synthetase, which helps the body produce glutathione. People with Glutathione synthetase deficiency can have mild, moderate, or severe disease. The signs and symptoms of the deficiency may include anemia, the buildup of too much acid in the body (metabolic acidosis), frequent infections, and symptoms caused by problems in the brain including seizures, intellectual disability, and loss of coordination (ataxia). Glutathione synthetase deficiency is caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variantss) in the GSS gene. The deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis of a metabolic disorder such as Glutathione synthetase deficiency may be suspected when a doctor observes signs of the deficiency including metabolic acidosis. A doctor may order tests to confirm the diagnosis including enzyme assays, urine analysis, and genetic testing."

"Summary of Subependymoma: Subependymomas are slow-growing brain tumors that are usually benign. They are most often found in the fourth or lateral ventricles in the brain, but may occur in the spine. Symptoms depend on the tumor location. Some people do not have symptoms, while others may have headaches, changes in vision, and/or difficulty with balance. These symptoms are thought to be due to obstruction of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) due to the tumor's location. Most Subependymomas are benign with a low recurrence rate. However, a few progress to anaplastic ependymoma (a faster growing tumor). The cause of Subependymomas is not well understood. Surgery to remove the tumor is often curative."

"Summary of Hemifacial myohyperplasia: Hemifacial myohyperplasia (HMH) is a developmental disorder that frequently affects the right side of the face and is commonly seen in males. On the affected side of the face, there are usually enlarged tissues that lead to an abnormal jaw shape. Other features associated with HMH include enlargement of the brain, epilepsy, strabismus, genitourinary system disorders, intellectual disability, and dilation of the pupil on the affected side . Asymmetry of the face is more noticeable with age and remains until the end of adolescence when the asymmetry stabilizes. The cause of HMH is unknown; but theories suggest an imbalance in the endocrine system, neuronal abnormalities, chromosomal abnormalities, random events in twinning and fetal development, and vascular or lymphatic abnormalities."
"Summary of Klebsiella infection: Klebsiella is a type of bacteria commonly found in nature. In humans, the bacteria are often present in parts of the digestive tract where they do not generally cause problems. In the United States, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca are the two strains responsible for most human illnesses. Many Klebsiella infections are acquired in the hospital setting or in long-term care facilities. In fact, Klebsiellae account for up to 8% of all hospital-acquired infections. People with a compromised immune system and/or people who have an implanted medical device (such as a urinary catheter or airway tube) are more at risk for Klebsiella infections. Extensive use of antibiotics has resulted in the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of Klebsiella."

"Summary of Hemochromatosis type 2: Hemochromatosis type 2 is a disease in which too much iron builds up in the body. This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. While many organs can be affected, iron overload is especially likely to affect the liver, heart, and pancreas. Symptoms of Hemochromatosis type 2 typically begin during childhood. Early symptoms of Hemochromatosis type 2 typically include liver disease, heart disease, and low levels of sex hormones. Having low levels of sex hormones can cause women to stop having their monthly periods and men to have delayed puberty. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, diabetes, and skin discoloration. Hemochromatosis type 2 is caused by genetic changes (genetic changes or pathogenic variants) to the HFE2 (HJV) or HAMP genes. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A diagnosis of Hemochromatosis type 2 is suspected when a doctor observes signs and symptoms of the disease. A doctor may decide to order laboratory tests including a liver biopsy, MRI, or blood test. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Hemochromatosis type 3: Hemochromatosis type 3 is a disease in which too much iron builds up in the body. This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. While many organs can be affected, iron overload is especially likely to affect the liver, heart, and pancreas. Early symptoms of Hemochromatosis type 3 can include fatigue, weakness, and joint pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, loss of sex drive, liver disease, diabetes, heart problems, and skin discoloration. Hemochromatosis type 3 is caused by genetic changes (genetic changes or pathogenic variants) to the TFR2 gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A diagnosis of Hemochromatosis type 3 is suspected when a doctor observes signs and symptoms of the disease. A doctor may decide to order laboratory tests including a liver biopsy, MRI, or blood test. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Hemochromatosis type 4: Hemochromatosis type 4 (also called ferroportin disease) is a disease in which too much iron builds up in the body. This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. While many organs can be affected, iron overload is especially likely to affect the liver, heart, and pancreas. Hemochromatosis type 4A   Hemochromatosis type 4B  People with Hemochromatosis type 4A might not have any symptoms of the disease. Other individuals may develop liver disease as they get older. Hemochromatosis type 4B can be associated with fatigue, weakness, and joint pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, loss of sex drive, liver disease, diabetes, heart problems, difficulty breathing, and skin discoloration. Symptoms of Hemochromatosis type 4B can begin anytime from childhood to adulthood. Hemochromatosis type 4 is most common in people of southern European ancestry. Hemochromatosis type 4 is caused by genetic changes (genetic changes or pathogenic variants) to the SLC40A1 gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A diagnosis of Hemochromatosis type 4 is suspected when a doctor observes signs and symptoms of the disease. A doctor may decide to order laboratory tests including a liver biopsy, MRI, or blood test. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer: Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is a condition that causes benign tumors of smooth muscle tissue in the skin (cutaneous leiomyomas) and in the uterus in females (uterine leiomyomas, or fibroids). The condition also increases the risk of kidney cancer. Signs and symptoms usually begin in adulthood as skin growths appear on the torso, arms, legs, and occasionally on the face. They tend to increase in size and number over time. About 10% to 16% of people with HLRCC develop a type of kidney cancer called renal cell cancer; symptoms of this cancer may include lower back pain, blood in the urine, and/or a mass in the kidney that can be felt by a physician. Some people have no symptoms until the cancer is advanced. HLRCC is caused by genetic changes in the FH gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."

"Summary of Osteopetrosis-hypogammaglobulinemia syndrome: Osteopetrosis refers to a group of rare, inherited skeletal disorders characterized by increased bone density and abnormal bone growth. Symptoms and severity can vary greatly, ranging from neonatal onset with serious complications (such as bone marrow failure) to the incidental finding of osteopetrosis on X-ray. Depending on severity and age of onset, features may include fractures, short stature, compressive neuropathies (pressure on the nerves), hypocalcemia with attendant tetanic seizures, and pancytopenia. In rare cases, there may be neurological impairment or involvement of other body systems. Osteopetrosis may be caused by genetic changes in at least 10 genes. Inheritance can be autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive with the most severe forms being autosomal recessive."

"Summary of Myasthenic syndrome, congenital, 4c, associated with acetylcholine receptor defi: Myasthenic syndrome, congenital, 4c, associated with acetylcholine receptor deficiency is a condition that affects the connection between nerves and muscles. It causes muscle weakness that starts early in life and can vary in severity. Tests show that the problem is due to a lack of a substance called AChR at the connection point between nerves and muscles. This condition is caused by genetic factors and can be inherited."
"Summary of Cornelia de Lange syndrome: Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms can vary widely, but may include distinctive facial characteristics, growth delays, intellectual disability and limb defects. Approximately 60% of people affected by CdLS have a disease-causing variation in the NIPBL gene, and about 10% of cases are caused by genetic changes in one of four known genes: SMC1A, SMC3, HDAC8 and RAD21. In the remaining 30% of cases, the underlying genetic cause of the condition is unknown. CdLS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC2, or RAD21) or X-linked (SMC1A or HDAC8) manner. However, most cases result from new (de novo) genetic changes and occur in people with no family history of the condition."
Summary of Hyperostosis-hyperphosphatemia syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Ichthyosis-hypotrichosis syndrome: Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) is a heterogeneous group of disorders of keratinization characterized primarily by abnormal skin scaling over the whole body. These disorders are limited to skin, with approximately two-thirds of patients presenting severe symptoms. The main skin phenotypes are lamellar ichthyosis (LI) and nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE), although phenotypic overlap within the same patient or among patients from the same family can occur (summary by Fischer, 2009). Neither histopathologic findings nor ultrastructural features clearly distinguish between NCIE and LI. In addition, mutations in several genes have been shown to cause both lamellar and nonbullous ichthyosiform erythrodermal phenotypes (Akiyama et al., 2003). At the First Ichthyosis Consensus Conference in Soreze in 2009, the term 'autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis' (ARCI) was designated to encompass LI, NCIE, and harlequin ichthyosis (ARCI4B; 242500) (Oji et al., 2010).NCIE is characterized by prominent erythroderma and fine white, superficial, semiadherent scales. Most patients present with collodion membrane at birth and have palmoplantar keratoderma, often with painful fissures, digital contractures, and loss of pulp volume. In half of the cases, a nail dystrophy including ridging, subungual hyperkeratosis, or hypoplasia has been described. Ectropion, eclabium, scalp involvement, and loss of eyebrows and lashes seem to be more frequent in NCIE than in lamellar ichthyosis (summary by Fischer et al., 2000). In LI, the scales are large, adherent, dark, and pigmented with no skin erythema. Overlapping phenotypes may depend on the age of the patient and the region of the body. The terminal differentiation of the epidermis is perturbed in both forms, leading to reduced barrier function and defects of lipid composition in the stratum corneum (summary by Lefevre et al., 2006).In later life, the skin in ARCI may have scales that cover the entire body surface, including the flexural folds, and the scales are highly variable in size and color. Erythema may be very mild and almost invisible. Some affected persons exhibit scarring alopecia, and many have secondary anhidrosis (summary by Eckl et al., 2005).For a general phenotypic description and discussion of genetic heterogeneity of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, see ARCI1 (242300)."

Summary of Oguchi disease: Oguchi disease is an autosomal recessive retinal disorder characterized by congenital stationary night blindness (see this term) and the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon.
"Summary of Cone dystrophy, x-linked, with tapetal-like sheen: Cone dystrophy, x-linked, with tapetal-like sheen is a rare eye disease that affects the retina. People with this disease may experience a greenish-golden sheen in large areas of their retina. Symptoms usually start in a person's 30s and include gradual vision loss, color vision problems, and difficulty seeing in the dark. Some people with this disease may show a symptom called the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon, where the retina appears to fade and reveal other structures in the eye when in the dark. In some cases, patients may develop a detached retina."
"Summary of Macular dystrophy, vitelliform, 1: Macular dystrophy, vitelliform, 1 is a type of inherited retinal dystrophy that affects the macula lutea (central part of the retina), which is important for clear vision. Vitelliform macular dystrophies (VMDs) are a specific type of macular dystrophy characterized by round yellow deposits in the macula that contain a pigment called lipofuscin. Unlike other forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy, this atypical type requires a special test called fluorescein angiography for most reliable diagnosis."
"Summary of MORM syndrome: A rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability characterized by language delay and mild to moderate intellectual disability associated with truncal obesity, congenital nonprogressive retinal dystrophy with poor night vision and reduced visual acuity, and micropenis in males. Cataracts may occur in the second or third decade of life."
"Summary of Progressive bifocal chorioretinal atrophy: Progressive bifocal chorioretinal atrophy (PBCRA) is an inherited condition of the eye characterized by a large wasted region of the macula, lesions in the area of the retina closest to the nose (the nasal retina), nystagmus (fast, uncontrollable movements of the eyes), myopia (nearsightedness), poor vision, and slow disease progression. Widespread abnormalities of rod and cone function has been described. PBCRA is caused by genetic changes in a gene which has mapped to a region on chromosome 6q, close to the macular dystrophy retinal 1 (MCDR1) locus. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."
Summary of Agnathia-microstomia-synotia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of GM1 gangliosidosis type 2: GM1 gangliosidosis is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder that progressively destroys nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord. The condition may be classified into three major types based on the general age that signs and symptoms first appear: classic infantile (type 1); juvenile (type 2); and adult onset or chronic (type 3). Although the types differ in severity, their features may overlap significantly. GM1 gangliosidosis is caused by genetic changes in the GLB1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Leydig cell hypoplasia due to LHB deficiency: Male patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to isolated luteinizing hormone (LH) deficiency have normal sexual differentiation but fail to develop spontaneous puberty. Absence of LH alters Leydig cell proliferation and maturation and impairs the onset of normal spermatogenesis, which requires high levels of intratesticular testosterone. Infertility and very low levels of spermatogenesis generally persist in affected men despite long-term exposure to gonadotropin therapy. Female patients exhibit normal pubertal development and menarche, followed by oligomenorrhea and anovulatory secondary amenorrhea (summary by Basciani et al., 2012).For a general phenotypic description and discussion of genetic heterogeneity of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, see 147950.ReviewsArnhold et al. (2009) noted that the clinical manifestations of female patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to mutations in LHB are very similar to those of women with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism due to inactivating mutations of the LH receptor (see 238320): all have female external genitalia, spontaneous development of normal pubic hair and breasts at puberty, and normal to late menarche followed by oligoamenorrhea and infertility. Pelvic ultrasound shows a small or normal uterus and normal or enlarged ovaries with cysts. However, women with LHB mutations can be treated with luteinizing hormone or chorionic gonadotropin (CG; 118860) replacement therapy; women with LH receptor mutations are resistant to LH, and no treatment is effective in recovering their fertility."
"Summary of Isolated follicle stimulating hormone deficiency: A rare congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism characterized by hypogonadism due to selective deficiency of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Clinical manifestations are primary amenorrhea, absent or incomplete breast development, and infertility in women, and small testes, azoospermia, and infertility in men. Luteinizing hormone is elevated in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test, while the FSH response is impaired."
"Summary of Isolated thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency: A type of central congenital hypothyroidism, a permanent thyroid deficiency that is present from birth, characterized by low levels of thyroid hormones due to a deficiency in TSH synthesis."
"Summary of Monosomy 22q13.3: Monosomy 22q13.3, also known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome, is a chromosome disorder caused by the loss (deletion) of a small piece of chromosome 22. The deletion occurs near the end of the long arm (or q arm) of the chromosome at a location designated as q13.3. Not everyone with monosomy 22q13.3 will have the same medical, developmental, or behavioral problems (features). Common problems include low muscle tone (hypotonia), intellectual disability, developmental delays especially delayed or absent speech, and tendency to overheat. Children may be tall and thin. Differences in other physical features are usually mild and may include long eyelashes, down slanting eyes, large ears, ears without normal folding, bulb-like tip of nose, pointed chin, large hands, and toenails that flake off as infants and then become hard and brittle as age. Unusual behaviors may include mouthing or chewing on non-food items, decreased perception of pain, and autistic-like behaviors such as flapping of hands and repetitive motions. Most reported cases of monosomy 22q13.3 are caused by 22q13.3 deletions, which usually includes many genes. The loss or the variation of a particular gene on chromosome 22, called the SHANK3 gene, is likely responsible for many of the common features associated with monosomy 22q13.3, especially intellectual disability, speech problems, low muscle tone, and developmental delay. Additional genes within the deleted area probably contribute to other features of the syndrome. In most cases, a larger deletion increases the number and severity of associated features, especially the severity of low muscle tone, developmental delay, differences in physical features, speech, and autism-like behavior. Smaller deletions located closer to the tip of the 22q seem to be associated with fewer medical, developmental, and behavioral problems."
"Summary of Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, Okinawa type: Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, Okinawa type is a rare, genetic, axonal hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by the adult-onset of slowly progressive, symmetric, proximal dominant muscle weakness and atrophy, painful muscle cramps, fasciculations and distal sensory impairment, mostly (but not exclusively) in individuals (and their descendents) from the Okinawa region in Japan.

"Summary of Dentinogenesis imperfecta type 3: Dentinogenesis imperfecta type 3 is a rare and severe form of dentinogenesis imperfecta, a condition that affects tooth development. People affected by this condition generally have discolored (most often a blue-gray or yellow-brown color) and translucent teeth. Teeth are also weaker than normal, making them prone to rapid wear, breakage, and loss. These problems can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. Dentinogenesis imperfecta type 3 is caused by changes in the DSPP gene which are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of 17p11.2 microduplication syndrome: 17p11.2 microduplication syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of an extra copy of a tiny portion of chromosome 17 (duplication of 17p11.2). People with this duplication often have some degree of developmental delay (primarily speech delay), low muscle tone, poor feeding, and failure to thrive during infancy. In addition, many individuals display some behaviors commonly associated with autism spectrum disorders. Some people with 17p11.2 microduplication syndrome have a heart defect.

Typical ear findings consist of malformed auricles (e.g. lop or cupped ears), preauricular pits and/or tags, and middle and/or inner ear dysplasias (inculding cochlear, vestibular and semicircular channel hypoplasia, malformation of the ossicles and of middle ear space)."
"Summary of Kyphomelic dysplasia: Kyphomelic dysplasia is a prenatal skeletal disease that causes dwarfism characterized by the following: a disproportionately short stature with a short narrow chest, shortening and bending (bowing) of the limbs, flared irregular metaphyses of the bones, and characteristic facial features. Bone changes are said to improve with age. Kyphomelic dysplasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  Recent studies indicate that Kyphomelic dysplasia is no longer considered it's own entity and that individual cases should be further evaluated and re-classified as another existing chondrodysplasias, such as Schwartz-Jampel syndrome."

"Summary of Nonseminomatous germ cell tumor: Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors are cancerous tumors commonly found in the pineal gland in the brain, in the mediastinum, or in the abdomen. They originate from cells that were meant to form sex cells (i.e., sperm or eggs). They are often large and have a tendency to spread more quickly than the other type of germ cell tumor (i.e., seminoma type). Possible early signs of this cancer include chest pain and breathing problems."
"Summary of Cerebrospinal fluid leak: It is a rare but very serious condition that requires rapid intervention. Symptoms include leak of clear fluid through the ear, inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain (meningitis), hearing loss, and seizures. The cause of a spinal fluid leak through the ear is a defect of the bone and meningeal layers covering the brain that separate the subarachnoid space of the brain from the middle ear and mastoid bone (located just behind the ear). The leaks occur after a surgery in the base of the skull, temporal bone fractures, congenital defects of the inner ear, trauma, or they may be spontaneous."
"Summary of Joubert syndrome 2: Classic Joubert syndrome (JS) is characterized by three primary findings: A distinctive cerebellar and brain stem malformation called the molar tooth sign (MTS). Hypotonia. Developmental delays. Often these findings are accompanied by episodic tachypnea or apnea and/or atypical eye movements. In general, the breathing abnormalities improve with age, truncal ataxia develops over time, and acquisition of gross motor milestones is delayed. Cognitive abilities are variable, ranging from severe intellectual disability to normal. Additional findings can include retinal dystrophy, renal disease, ocular colobomas, occipital encephalocele, hepatic fibrosis, polydactyly, oral hamartomas, and endocrine abnormalities. Both intra- and interfamilial variation are seen."

"Summary of Florid cemento-osseous dysplasia: Florid cemento-osseous dysplasia (FCOD) is a condition that occurs in the jaw bone, especially close to where the teeth are formed. People with FCOD develop lesions in the jaw, were spots of normal bone are replaced with a mix of connective tissue and abnormal bone. The lesions are often found in equal numbers and size on both sides of the jaw. People with FCOD rarely have symptoms and it is usually found with dental x-rays during a routine dental examination. The cause of FCOD is unknown, and it does not usually run in families. It mainly occurs in middle aged women of African American and Asian descent. The number, size, and shape of the lesions can be different from person to person. Occasionally the lesions expand or get infected and may cause discomfort, pain, or mild disfigurement."

"Summary of Brooke-Spiegler syndrome: Brooke-Spiegler syndrome causes the growth of several types of non-cancerous (benign) skin tumors. Tumors mainly grow on the scalp and face, but can also grow on the torso, genitals and armpits. Tumors usually first appear in the teens or early adulthood. The types of tumors that occur in Brooke-Spiegler syndrome may include cylindromas, spiradenomas, and trichoepitheliomas. The number of tumors increases over time, and in severe cases, tumors can cover most of the scalp. Rarely, a tumor will become cancerous. Other complications may include an increased risk to develop basal cell cancer of the salivary gland or deafness due to the growth of a tumor in the ear canal. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is caused by genetic variants in the CYLD gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis of Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and microscopic exam of the tumor tissue. Results of genetic testing may help confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of Epithelioid sarcoma: Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) is a rare cancerous tumor that most often occurs in the soft tissue of the fingers, hands and forearms of young adults. It can also occur elsewhere in the body. ES usually begins as a painless, firm growth or bump that may be accompanied by an open wound (ulceration) in the skin covering the growth. The cause of Epithelioid sarcoma is unknown. It is diagnosed by a clinical examination and by testing a small sample of the tumor (biopsy) in a laboratory."

Summary of Neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis due to citrin deficiency: Neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) is a liver condition is also known as neonatal-onset type II citrullinemia. NICCD blocks the flow of bile (a digestive fluid produced by the liver) and prevents the body from processing certain nutrients properly. This leads to transient intrahepatic cholestasis and variable liver dysfunction in children younger than one year of age. NICCD is generally not severe. NICCD is caused by genetic changes in the SLC25A13 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
"Summary of Citrullinemia type II: Citrullinemia type II is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic substances to accumulate in the blood. The condition chiefly affects the nervous system, causing confusion, restlessness, memory loss, abnormal behaviors (such as aggression, irritability, and hyperactivity), seizures, and coma. These signs and symptoms can be life-threatening. The signs and symptoms appear during adulthood and are triggered by certain medications, infections, surgery, and alcohol intake. The features of adult-onset type II citrullinemia may also develop in people who as infants had a liver disorder called neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). In many cases, the signs and symptoms of NICCD resolve within a year. Years or even decades later, however, some of these people develop the characteristic features of adult-onset type II citrullinemia. Adult-onset Citrullinemia type II is caused by genetic changes in the SLC25A13 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of NDE1-related microhydranencephaly: NDE1-related microhydranencephaly is a developmental abnormality that affects the brain. Signs and symptoms may include extreme microcephaly, scalp rugae (a series of ridges), profound developmental delay and severe intellectual disability. Imaging studies of the brain generally reveal incomplete brain formation and severe hydrocephalus (accumulation of fluid in the brain). Rarely, the condition is caused by changes in the NDE1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

"Summary of Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with metatarsal shortening: A rare, genetic, primary bone dysplasia disorder characterized by early-onset, progressive pseudorheumatoid arthritis, platyspondyly, and hypoplasia/dysplasia of the third and fourth metatarsals, in the absence of ophthalmologic, cleft palate, and height anomalies."
"Summary of Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBD deficiency) is an inborn error of valine (an amino acid) metabolism. The symptoms, which may not develop until later in infancy or childhood, can include failure to thrive, dilated cardiomyopathy, seizures, and anemia. IBD deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the ACAD8 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Zygomycosis: A rare mycosis caused by ubiquitous, opportunistic fungi of the order Mucorales, characterized by tissue infarction and necrosis due to invasion of the vasculature by hyphae. The spectrum of clinical manifestations depends on the route of infection and includes rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, gastrointestinal, renal, and disseminated forms. The disease is usually rapidly progressive and associated with high mortality."
"Summary of Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) is a genetic disease in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive and form a tumor (neoplasia). Common tumors that may be associated with MEN2B include medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and tumors of the adrenal glands called pheochromocytomas. Other features of MEN2B can include having bumps on the lips, eyelids, and tongue. People with MEN2B typically have a body type with long arms, legs, and fingers. They may also have joints that are very loose (hyperextensible). MEN2B is caused by a specific genetic change (pathogenic variant) in the RET gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A diagnosis of MEN2B is suspected when a person has a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, or physical findings suggestive of MEN2B. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing."

"Summary of Autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1A: A rare subtype of autosomal dominant limb girdle muscular dystrophy characterized by an adult onset of proximal shoulder and hip girdle weakness (that later progresses to include distal weakness), nasal speech and dysarthria. Other frequent findings include tightened heel cords, reduced deep-tendon reflexes and elevated creatine kinase serum levels. Respiratory failure, as well as mild facial weakness and dysphagia, may also be observed."
"Summary of Emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy 2, autosomal dominant: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 2, autosomal dominant (Emd2) is one of many types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. These diseases affect the voluntary muscles, which are the muscles that are moved on purpose, such as the arms, legs, fingers, toes, and facial muscles. Specifically, Emd2 causes muscle weakness in the lower limbs. The muscle weakness typically affects the muscles closest to the center of the body (proximal muscles) such as the upper legs. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 2, autosomal dominant is caused by genetic changes (changes) to the LMNA gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A diagnosis of Emd2 is suspected in people who have signs and symptoms consistent with the disease, and the diagnosis can be confirmed with laboratory tests."

"Summary of Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease: Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease is a rare condition that affects the brain and other parts of the nervous system. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary from person to person, even within the same family. Signs and symptoms may include recurrent episodes of confusion, seizures, ataxia (problems coordinating movements), dystonia, facial palsy (weakness of the facial muscles), external ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the muscles surrounding the eye), and dysphagia. Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease is caused by changes in the SLC19A3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy: Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is a rare condition characterized by reduced body fat and increased muscle size. Affected individuals have up to twice the usual amount of muscle mass in their bodies. They also tend to have increased muscle strength. This condition is not known to cause any medical problems, and affected individuals are intellectually normal. Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is caused by genetic changes in the MSTN gene. It follows an incomplete autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of H syndrome: Histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome is a group of conditions with overlapping signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body. This group of disorders includes H syndrome, pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (PHID), Faisalabad histiocytosis, and familial Rosai-Dorfman disease (also known as familial sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy or FSHML). These conditions were once thought to be distinct disorders; however, because of the overlapping features and shared genetic cause, they are now considered to be part of the same disease spectrum. While some affected individuals have signs and symptoms characteristic of one of these conditions, others have a range of features from two or more of the conditions. The pattern of signs and symptoms can vary, even within the same family. All of the conditions in the spectrum are characterized by histiocytosis, which is an overgrowth of immune system cells called histiocytes. These cells abnormally accumulate in one or more tissues in the body, which can lead to organ or tissue damage. The lymph nodes are commonly affected, leading to swelling of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). Other areas of cell accumulation can include skin, kidneys, brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), or digestive tract. The spectrum is known as histiocytosis-lymphadenoapthy plus syndrome because the disorders that make up the spectrum can have additional signs and symptoms. H syndrome is named for the collection of symptoms - all starting with the letter H - that are commonly present. These include hyperpigmented skin lesions with excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) and histiocyte accumulation, enlargement of the liver or liver and spleen (hepatomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly), heart abnormalities, hearing loss, reduced amounts of hormones that direct sexual development (hypogonadism), and short stature (reduced height). In some cases, hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus may also be present. PHID is characterized by patches of hyperpigmented skin with hypertrichosis and the development of type 1 diabetes during childhood. Faisalabad histiocytosis is characterized by lymphadenopathy and swelling of the eyelids due to the accumulation of histiocytes. Affected individuals may also have joint deformities (contractures) in their fingers or toes, and hearing loss. Familial Rosai-Dorfman disease is characterized by lymphadenopathy, most often in the neck. Histiocytes can also accumulate in other parts of the body. Histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the SLC29A3 gene. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
Summary of CoQ-responsive OXPHOS deficiency: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Diamond-blackfan anemia 3: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) in its classic form is characterized by a profound normochromic and usually macrocytic anemia with normal leukocytes and platelets, congenital malformations in up to 50% of affected individuals, and growth retardation in 30% of affected individuals. The hematologic complications occur in 90% of affected individuals during the first year of life. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from a mild form (e.g., mild anemia, no anemia with only subtle erythroid abnormalities, physical malformations without anemia) to a severe form of fetal anemia resulting in nonimmune hydrops fetalis. DBA is associated with an increased risk for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and solid tumors including osteogenic sarcoma."
Summary of Familial lipase maturation factor 1 deficiency: A rare disorder caused by mutation in the LMF1 gene resulting in combined lipase deficiency with concomitant hypertriglyceridemia and associated disorders.
"Summary of Asthma: ""Asthma is a breathing disorder that affects the airways. People with this condition experience recurrent swelling and narrowing of the airways of the lungs which is associated with wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Most affected people have episodes of symptoms (""""Asthma attacks"""") followed by symptom-free periods; however, some may experience persistent shortness of breath in between attacks. Asthma is considered a complex or multifactorial condition that is likely due to a combination of multiple genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Many people with Asthma have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever or eczema. Having a family member with Asthma is associated with an increased risk of developing the condition."""
"Summary of Down syndrome: Down syndrome is a chromosome disorder associated with intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, with small nose and an upward slant to the eyes, and low muscle tone in infancy. The degree of intellectual disability varies from mild to moderate. People with Down syndrome may also be born with various health concerns such as heart defects or digestive abnormalities, as well as short stature and a single deep crease across the center of the palm. They also have an increased risk to develop gastroesophageal reflux, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, hearing and vision problems, leukemia, and Alzheimer disease. Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of chromosome 21 (called trisomy 21) instead of the usual two copies and is typically not inherited."
"Summary of Rare disease with autism: Rare disease with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that affects the development of social and communication skills. It includes features of four conditions which were once thought to be separate syndromes - autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder. Common symptoms shared by people with ASD include restrictive and repetitive behaviors, social impairment and communication difficulties. The underlying cause of ASD is generally unknown and it is likely that a variety of factors contribute to the development of the condition. ASD appears to run in some families, suggesting that genetics may play a role in some cases."

"Summary of Psoriasis: Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes itchy or sore patches of thick, red skin with silvery scales. The skin on the elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms and feet is most often affected, but other parts of the body can be affected as well. A problem with the immune system causes Psoriasis. In a process called cell turnover, skin cells that grow deep in the skin rise to the surface. Normally, this takes a month. In Psoriasis, it happens in just days because the cells rise too fast. Although symptoms may come and go, for many, Psoriasis is a lifelong condition. Infections, stress, dry skin and certain medications may make symptoms worse. Psoriasis usually occurs in adults. It sometimes runs in families."
"Summary of Hydatidiform mole: Molar pregnancy is a condition in which the placenta does not develop properly. The symptoms of molar pregnancy, which may include vaginal bleeding, severe morning sickness, stomach cramps, and high blood pressure, typically begin around the 10th week of pregnancy. Because the embryo does not form or is malformed in molar pregnancies, and because there is a small risk of developing a cancer called choriocarcinoma, a D&C is usually performed."
"Summary of Spinal meningioma: Spinal meningioma is a rare type of spinal cord cancer. The spinal cord is part of the central nervous system. This tumor often affects middle-aged women. Tumors of the spinal cord can be either primary or arise from other primary tumors (metastatic), and are typically slow growing. Other features are motor deficits, sensory deficits, pain, and sphincter dysfunction. The thoracic spine (middle back) is the most common site, followed by the cervical spine (neck). These tumors are rarely seen in the lumbar region (lower back). The only proven risk factor in the development of meningioma is exposure to ionizing radiation. Also, patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 are at increased risk of developing meningioma."
"Summary of Pityriasis lichenoides: Pityriasis lichenoides (PL) is a skin condition characterized by small, raised pink spots that tend to come together in groups. It is not contagious. There are two main types of PL: an acute form called Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA), and a milder, longer-lasting form called Pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC). There is also a rare, severe variant of PLEVA called febrile ulceronecrotic PLEVA, associated with high fever and complications that may affect other body systems. In both types of PL, spots usually occur on the trunk, buttox, arms and legs. PLEVA begins abruptly and may cause itching or burning. PLC may develop over days, is less irritating, and lasts longer than PLEVA. Spots associated with PLC typically fade within 3 to 4 weeks, but new spots may then appear. There is no clear consensus regarding how long either form of PL lasts, but most cases resolve on their own within one to several months. The cause of PL is not known. Theories on the cause have included the possibility of a low-grade or self-limited lymphoproliferative disorder; a reaction to a bacterial or viral infection; and an inappropriate, inflammatory immune response to an unknown foreign agent."
"Summary of Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis: Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (HCHWA) is a neurological condition in which an abnormal protein (amyloid) builds up in the walls of the arteries of the brain (and less frequently, veins). This process is known as amyloid deposition, which can lead to strokes, seizures, neurological deficits, cognitive decline, and dementia. Symptoms usually present before the 5th decade of life. There are many different ways of classifying the types of HCHWA based on the underlying genetic changes, proteins involved, signs and symptoms, and the regions in which they were first described. The Dutch, Arctic, Piedmont, Iowa, Flemish, Italian types are caused by genetic changes in the APP gene   The British and Danish types are caused by genetic changes in the ITM2B gene   The Icelandic type is caused by genetic changes in the CST3 gene   All types of HCHWA currently described are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Hyper-beta-alaninemia: Hyperbetaalaninemia is a very rare metabolic condition. Hyperbetaalaninemia refers to the build-up of protein building blocks, called beta amino acids, in the body. The excess beta amino acids are neurotoxic to the body. Signs and symptoms of Hyperbetaalaninemia include convulsions (rapid and uncontrollable shaking), lethargy, and encephalopathy. Hyperbetaalaninemia is thought to be due to a loss of a functional form of the enzyme, beta-alanine-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase."

"Summary of Adducted thumbs-arthrogryposis syndrome, Christian type: Adducted thumbs-arthrogryposis syndrome, Christian type is a rare genetic condition that affects the development of the body and often leads to early death. It is caused by a recessive gene, meaning a person must inherit one copy of the gene from each parent to develop the condition. The syndrome is characterized by several physical features, including: congenital cleft palate, microcephaly (small head size), craniosynostosis (premature fusion of skull bones), arthrogryposis (limited movement of joints), and intellectual disability. Other physical features may include: differences in facial features, difficulty swallowing due to velopharyngeal insufficiency (incomplete closure of opening between oral and nasal cavities), generalized muscular hypotonia (low muscle tone), cyanosis (bluish skin color), hypertrichosis of the lower extremities (excessive hair growth on legs), and scleredema (hardening and thickening of the skin)."
"Summary of Aquagenic pruritus: Aquagenic pruritus causes intense itching without any visible skin changes after contact with water of any temperature. The symptoms may begin immediately after contact and can last for an hour or more. The cause of Aquagenic pruritus is unknown; however, familial cases have been described. Aquagenic pruritis is sometimes a symptom of other conditions such as polycythemia vera. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and a clinical examination."
"Summary of Isolated Klippel-Feil syndrome: Klippel Feil syndrome (KFS) is a condition affecting the development of the bones in the spine. People with KFS are born with abnormal fusion of at least two spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck. Common features may include a short neck, low hairline at the back of the head, and restricted movement of the upper spine. Some people with KFS have no symptoms. Others may have frequent headaches, back and neck pain, and other nerve issues. People with KFS are at risk for severe spinal injury. KFS can occur along with other types of birth defects, and sometimes KFS occurs as a feature of another disorder or syndrome. The cause of most cases of KFS is unknown, but sometimes it is caused by genetic alterations in one of several different genes. This condition is diagnosed based on a clinical examination, the symptoms, and imaging studies."

"Summary of Periventricular leukomalacia: Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a brain injury disorder characterized by the death of the white matter of the brain due to softening of the brain tissue. It can affect fetuses or newborns, and premature babies are at the greatest risk of the disorder. PVL is caused by a lack of oxygen or blood flow to the area around the ventricles of the brain, which results in the death of brain tissue."
Summary of Cluster headache: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Rolandic epilepsy: Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) is the most common form of childhood epilepsy. It is referred to as ""benign"" because most children outgrow the condition by puberty. This form of epilepsy is characterized by seizures involving a part of the brain called the rolandic area. These seizures typically occur during the nighttime. Other features of BRE include headaches or migraines and behavioral and/or learning differences. BRE is thought to be a genetic disorder because most affected individuals have a family history of epilepsy."
Summary of Neutral lipid storage myopathy: Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy is a condition in which fats (lipids) are stored abnormally in organs and tissues throughout the body. The accumulation of fats in muscle tissue leads to muscle weakness (myopathy). This condition is caused by genetic changes in the PNPLA2 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

"Summary of Wormian bone-multiple fractures-dentinogenesis imperfecta-skeletal dysplasia: Skeletal dysplasia with wormian bone-multiple fractures-dentinogenesis imperfecta is a skeletal disorder, reported in three patients to date, characterized clinically by multiple fractures, wormian bones of the skull, dentinogenesis imperfecta and facial dysmorphism (hypertelorism, periorbital fullness). Although the signs are very similar to osteogenesis imperfecta, characteristic cortical defects in the absence of osteopenia and collagen abnormalities are considered to be distinctive. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1999."
"Summary of Linear nevus sebaceus syndrome: Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS) is a condition characterized by the association of a large, linear sebaceous nevus (type of birthmark) with a broad range of abnormalities that may affect every organ system, including the central nervous system (CNS). The nevus usually is located on the face, scalp, or neck. The most common CNS abnormalities are intellectual disability, seizures, and hemimegalencephaly (abnormal enlargement of one side of the brain). Various other CNS abnormalities have been reported. Other signs and symptoms may include various eye abnormalities; skeletal (bone) deformities; heart defects; urogenital abnormalities; and an increased risk of cancer with age. LNSS is not inherited (it is sporadic). It can be caused by a somatic genetic change in any of several genes. Genetic changes that cause LNSS occur after fertilization and are only present in some body cells (mosaicism)."
Summary of Autosomal recessive ataxia due to ubiquinone deficiency: This syndrome is characterised by childhood-onset progressive ataxia and cerebellar atrophy.
"Summary of Syndactyly-telecanthus-anogenital and renal malformations syndrome: Syndactyly-telecanthus-anogenital and renal malformations syndrome (STAR syndrome) is a very rare syndrome that affects many parts of the body. STAR is an acronym for the primary signs and symptoms of the syndrome: Syndactyly - webbed or conjoined fingers or toes (the toes are particularly affected in this syndrome). Telecanthus - increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes. Anogenital malformations - abnormal formation of the anus and/or genitals. Renal malformations.  However, some people with STAR syndrome have had a variety of additional features affecting many parts of the body. STAR syndrome may be caused by a deletion affecting the FAM58A gene, also called the CCNQ gene. In some cases, other features may be due to larger deletions that involve other genes besides the FAM58A gene. Additional features that have been reported include other skeletal abnormalities, hearing loss, epilepsy, ocular abnormalities, syringomyelia, tethered spinal cord, and various other birth defects. Inheritance of STAR syndrome is X-linked dominant. The syndrome is thought to be lethal in male embryos; only females with STAR syndrome have been reported."
"Summary of 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome: 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion of several genes on chromosome 15. When a syndrome is caused by the deletion of several genes, it is also known as a microdeletion syndrome or a contiguous gene deletion syndrome. Individuals with 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome may have very different signs and symptoms from other affected individuals (even within the same family), or no symptoms at all. Features of the condition may include mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, learning delays, or normal intelligence; autism spectrum disorders; epilepsy (recurring seizures); and mental illness (such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder). Various dysmorphic (abnormally formed) features have been reported, but there are no consistent physical features among individuals who have the condition. 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome is caused by a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 15 that spans at least 7 genes and usually includes the CHRNA7 gene.It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance, or can occur as a new (de novo) deletion."
Summary of Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia: Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia syndrome (GHDD) is a rare disorder characterized by increased bone density (predominantly diaphyseal) and aregenerative corticosteroid-sensitive anemia.
"Summary of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a disorder that involves many different areas of the body and can vary greatly in severity among people with the condition. Signs and symptoms may include: cleft palate, heart defects, recurrent infections, unique facial characteristics, feeding problems, kidney abnormalities, hypoparathyroidism, thrombocytopenia, scoliosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, and learning disabilities. People with this condition are also more likely to develop certain autoimmune disorders and personality disorders. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion of a small part of chromosome 22 near the middle of the chromosome at a location known as q11.2. In most cases, the syndrome occurs for the first time in the affected person; about 10% of cases are inherited from a parent. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."

Other reported features include macrocephaly, behavioral abnormalities (e.g., attention deficit disorder), seizures, hypotonia and ocular and digital anomalies (poly/syndactyly)."
"Summary of Nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: Nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis, also known as Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), occurs when an excessive amount of antidiuretic hormone is released resulting in water retention and a low sodium level. It is most common among older people. It has many causes including, but not limited too, pain, stress, exercise, a low blood sugar level, certain disorders of the heart, thyroid gland, kidneys, or adrenal glands, and the use of certain medications. Disorders of the lungs and certain cancers may increase the risk of developing Nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis."
"Summary of Congenital disorder of glycosylation: Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders that affect a process called glycosylation. Glycosylation is the complex process by which all human cells build long sugar chains that are attached to proteins, which are called glycoproteins. There are many steps involved in this process, and each step is triggered by a type of protein called an enzyme. Individuals with a CDG are missing one of the enzymes that is required for glycosylation. The type of CDG that a person has depends on which enzyme is missing. Currently, there are 19 identified types of CDG. CDG type IA is the most common form. The symptoms of CDG vary widely among affected individuals. Some people have severe developmental delay, failure to thrive, and multiple organ problems, while others have diarrhea, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), liver problems, and normal developmental potential."

Summary of Immunodeficiency due to interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 deficiency: Immunodeficiency due to interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 deficiency (IRAK-4 deficiency) is a condition that affects the immune system (primary immunodeficiency). It causes recurring severe infections by a type of bacteria called pyogenic bacteria. Individuals with IRAK-4 deficiency seem to be particularly susceptible to infections caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. The deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the IRAK4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
"Summary of Neurogenic scapuloperoneal syndrome, Kaeser type: A rare, genetic, neuromuscular disease characterized by adult-onset muscle weakness and atrophy in a scapuloperoneal distribution, mild involvement of the facial muscles, dysphagia, and gynecomastia. Elevated serum CK levels and mixed myopathic and neurogenic abnormalities are associated clinical findings."
"Summary of MYH7-related late-onset scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy: MYH7-related scapuloperoneal myopathy is an inherited muscular dystrophy characterized by weakness and wasting of the muscles in the lower legs and the area of the shoulder blades. In some individuals, facial muscles may also be affected. Some cases of scapuloperoneal myopathy are caused by genetic changes in the MYH7 gene. Autosomal dominant inheritance is suggested in these cases."
"Summary of Scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy: A rare, genetic motor neuron disease characterized by predominantly motor axonal peripheral neuropathy manifesting with progressive scapuloperoneal muscular atrophy and weakness, laryngeal palsy, congenital absence of muscles, and, in some, skeletal abnormalities."
"Summary of Congenital multicore myopathy with external ophthalmoplegia: Multiminicore disease (MMD) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder defined pathologically by the presence of multiple areas of reduced mitochondrial oxidative activity running along a limited extent of the longitudinal axis of the muscle fiber, so-called 'minicores.' These regions show sarcomere disorganization and mitochondria depletion. Typically, no dystrophic signs, such as muscle fiber necrosis or regeneration or significant endomysial fibrosis, are present. MMD is a pathologic diagnosis and shows clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Affected individuals have clinical features of a congenital myopathy, including neonatal hypotonia, delayed motor development, and generalized muscle weakness and amyotrophy, which may progress slowly or remain stable (Ferreiro and Fardeau, 2002).Patients with recessive mutations in the RYR1 gene typically show severe congenital muscular dystrophy with ophthalmoplegia, although there is phenotypic variability. Some patients may present in utero with fetal akinesia, arthrogryposis, and lung hypoplasia resulting in fetal or perinatal death (McKie et al., 2014). Skeletal muscle biopsy of patients with recessive RYR1 mutations show variable features, including central cores (Jungbluth et al., 2007), congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD) (Monnier et al., 2009), and centronuclear myopathy (Wilmshurst et al., 2010)."
"Summary of Megaconial congenital muscular dystrophy: A rare, genetic, skeletal muscle disease characterized by an early-onset hypotonia, muscle weakness, global developmental delay with intellectual disability, and cardiomyopathy. Congenital structural heart defects and ichthyosiform cutaneous lesions have also been associated. Muscle biopsy shows characteristic enlarged mitochondria located at the periphery of muscle fibers."
Summary of Pleoconial myopathy with salt craving: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autosomal dominant prognathism: A rare, genetic, developmental defect during embryogenesis disorder characterized by abnormal forward projection of the mandible beyond the standard relation to the cranial base, with lower incisors often overlapping the upper incisors, that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Association with mildly everted lower eyelids, flat malar area, thickened lower lip and craniosynostosis has been reported."
"Summary of Corneal dystrophy, lattice type iiia: Lattice corneal dystrophy type 3A is rare condition that affects the cornea. It is characterized primarily by protein clumps in the clear, outer covering of the eye which cloud the cornea and impair vision. Affected people also experience recurrent corneal erosion (separation of certain layers of the cornea), which is associated with severe pain and sensitivity to bright light. Lattice corneal dystrophy type 3A is caused by changes in the TGFBI gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 1: 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA) type I is an inborn error of leucine metabolism with a variable clinical phenotype ranging from mildly delayed speech to psychomotor retardation, coma, failure to thrive, metabolic acidosis and dystonia."
"Summary of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is an organic acid disorder in which individuals lack adequate levels of an enzyme called 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme assists in the processing of a particular amino acid called isoleucine. The inability to process isoleucine correctly leads to the buildup of the amino acid in the body. The buildup can cause a variety of health problems, which vary widely from severe and life-threatening to mild or absent. Signs and symptoms of the disorder can begin a few days after birth or later in childhood. The initial symptoms often include poor feeding, lack of energy, vomiting, and irritability. These symptoms sometimes progress to serious medical problems such as difficulty breathing, seizures, and coma.[ This condition is caused by genetic changes in the ACADSB gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of L-Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency: L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency is a rare condition that primarily affects the brain. People with AGAT deficiency generally have mild to moderate intellectual disability. Other signs and symptoms may include seizures, delayed language development, muscle weakness, failure to thrive, autistic behaviors, and delayed motor milestones (i.e. walking, sitting). AGAT deficiency is caused by changes in the GATM gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Mild phenylketonuria: Mild phenylketonuria is a rare form of phenylketouria (PKU variant), an inborn error of amino acid metabolism, characterized by symptoms of PKU of mild to moderate severity. Patients with blood phenylalanine concentrations of 600-1,200 micromol/L are considered to have mild PKU. Clinical signs include reduced cognitive function and behavioral and developmental disorders. It is caused by certain genetic changes in the PAH gene which result in slightly higher activity of the phenylalanine hydroxylase compared with the classic phenylketonuria where there is a complete or near-complete deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
Summary of Progressive encephalopathy with leukodystrophy due to DECR deficiency: Progressive encephalopathy with leukodystrophy due to DECR deficiency is associated with hypotonia and respiratory acidosis in infancy. This condition may be associated with the DECR1 gene and likely has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.
Summary of Congenital human immunodeficiency virus: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Medium-chain 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase deficiency: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Tyrosinemia type 3: Tyrosinemia type 3 is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated blood levels of the amino acid tyrosine, a building block of most proteins. This condition is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, one of the enzymes required for the multi-step process that breaks down tyrosine. This enzyme shortage is caused by genetic changes in the HPD gene. Characteristic features include intellectual disability, seizures, and periodic loss of balance and coordination (intermittent ataxia). Tyrosinemia type 3 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Sickle cell-beta-thalassemia disease syndrome: Sickle cell-beta-thalassemia disease syndrome is an inherited condition that affects hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to different parts of the body. It is a type of sickle cell disease. Affected people have a different change in each copy of their HBB gene: one that causes red blood cells to form a """"sickle"""" or crescent shape and a second that is associated with beta thalassemia, a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. Depending on the beta thalassemia genetic change, people may have no normal hemoglobin (called sickle beta zero thalassemia) or a reduced amount of normal hemoglobin (called sickle beta plus thalassemia). The presence of sickle-shaped red blood cells, which often breakdown prematurely and can get stuck in blood vessels, combined with the reduction or absence of mature red blood cells leads to the many signs and symptoms of sickle cell-beta-thalassemia disease syndrome. Features, which may include anemia (low levels of red blood cells), repeated infections, and frequent episodes of pain, generally develop in early childhood and vary in severity depending on the amount of normal hemoglobin made. Sickle cell-beta-thalassemia disease syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Diffuse gastric cancer: ""Diffuse gastric cancer is a type of cancer found most often in the glandular cells lining the stomach, but can also develop in the bowel, breast, pancreas, bladder, prostate or lung. The 2010 WHO (World Health Organization) classification recognizes four major histologic patterns of gastric cancers: tubular, papillary, mucinous and poorly cohesive (including signet ring cell carcinoma), plus uncommon histologic variants. The term """"signet ring cell"""" is often used because the cells look like signet rings when viewed under a microscope. The signet cells are a type of epithelial cell. Epithelial tissue is skin tissue, covering and lining the body both inside and out."""
"Summary of Mucopolysaccharidosis type 1: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a condition that affects many parts of the body. MPS I is caused by genetic changes in the IDUA gene. These genetic changes lead to reduced levels or the complete lack of the IDUA enzyme. Without the proper amount of this enzyme, large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) accumulate within cells called lysosomes. This causes the lysosomes to increase in size, causing many different organs and tissues of the body to become enlarged. This leads to the medical problems seen in the condition. MPS I was once divided into three separate syndromes: Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, and Scheie syndrome, listed from most to least severe."
"Summary of Severe combined immunodeficiency due to complete RAG1/2 deficiency: Severe combined immunodeficiency due to complete RAG1/2 deficiency is a rare, genetic T-B- severe combined immunodeficiency disorder due to null mutations in recombination activating gene (RAG) 1 and/or RAG2 resulting in less than 1% of wild type V(D)J recombination activity. Patients present with neonatal onset of life-threatening, severe, recurrent infections by opportunistic fungal, viral and bacterial micro-organisms, as well as skin rashes, chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive and fever. Immunologic observations include profound T- and B-cell lymphopenia, normal NK counts and low or absent serum immunoglobulins; some patients may have eosinophilia."
"Summary of Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-postaxial polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome: MPPH syndrome is a disorder characterized by the presence of multiple birth defects and developmental delay. Classic signs and symptoms include polymicrogyria, megalencephaly, seizures, polydactyly, and hydrocephalus. Other features might include characteristic facial features, low muscle tone (hypotonia), and impaired vision. Genetic changes in at least three different genes have been identified that cause MPPH including PIK3R2, AKT3, and CCND2. Most cases of MPPH syndrome are new (de novo) in families with no prior history. The diagnosis of MPPH syndrome is based on physical examination, imaging studies, and genetic testing."
"Summary of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 4: 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA) type IV, or unclassified 3-MGA, is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterised by increased 3-methylglutaconic acid excretion in individuals that cannot be classified as having one of the other forms of 3-MGA (3-MGA I, II or III)."
"Summary of Charles Bonnet syndrome: Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is a disease in which visual hallucinations occur as a result of vision loss. CBS is not thought to be related to psychosis or dementia and people with CBS are aware that their hallucinations are not real. The hallucinations people with CBS experience can be described as simple or complex. Simple hallucinations include shapes and patterns, while complex include images of people, vehicles, animals, and plants. Hallucination episodes can range from a few seconds to hours and may recur over the course of several days to years. The cause of CBS is not well understood, but it is thought to be related to the brain continuing to interpret images, even in their absence. There are many underlying diseases of vision loss that are associated with CBS, such as macular degeneration and stroke. Hallucinations may resolve in instances where the the underlying vision issue can be corrected (such as with cataracts)."
Summary of Dermal eccrine cylindroma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Gamma-heavy chain disease: Gamma heavy chain disease affects the growth of cells in the immune system. People with this disease make an abnormal form of the gamma heavy chain, a protein used to make antibodies. This abnormal protein is overproduced by the body and can lead to abnormal cell growth. Gamma heavy chain disease mainly affects older adults with symptoms that may include swollen lymph nodes, an enlarged liver and spleen, and anemia. Some people with Gamma heavy chain disease have no symptoms, while others have many symptoms and can develop an aggressive form of lymphoma. The cause of Gamma heavy chain disease is unknown, but about one-third of people with this condition have an autoimmune disease. Diagnosis is based on finding high levels of gamma heavy chain in the blood, urine, and bone marrow. Gamma heavy chain disease is one of three different types of heavy chain disease."
Summary of Bizzare parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Lymphocytic hypophysitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Acquired hemophilia: Acquired hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that interferes with the body's blood clotting process. Signs and symptoms include prolonged bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, bruising throughout the body, solid swellings of congealed blood (hematomas), hematuria, and gastrointestinal or urologic bleeding. Acquired hemophilia occurs when the body's immune system attacks and disables a certain protein that helps the blood clot. About half of the cases are associated with other conditions, such as pregnancy, autoimmune disease, cancer, skin diseases, or allergic reactions to medications."
"Summary of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurological condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. Initial symptoms include problems with coordination and balance (ataxia). Other early signs and symptoms include speech difficulties (dysarthria), involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and double vision. Over time, individuals with SCA6 may develop loss of coordination in their arms, tremors, and uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia). The signs and symptoms of SCA6 typically begin in a person's forties or fifties. Most people with this disorder require wheelchair assistance by the time they are in their sixties. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 is caused by genetic changes in the CACNA1A gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
"Summary of Familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy: A rare, genetic, constitutional thrombocytopenia disease characterized by mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, abnormal platelet function and a propensity to develop hematological malignancies, mainly of myeloid origin."
"Summary of Porphyria: Porphyrias are a group of blood conditions caused by a lack of an enzyme in the body that makes heme, an important molecule that carries oxygen throughout the body and is vital for all of the body's organs. Major types include ALAD deficiency Porphyria, acute intermittent Porphyria, congenital erythropoietic Porphyria, erythropoietic protoPorphyria, hepatoerythropoietic Porphyria, hereditary coproPorphyria, Porphyria cutanea tarda, and variegate Porphyria. The most common type of Porphyria is Porphyria cutanea tarda. Some of the symptoms of Porphyria include blistering, swelling, and itching when the skin is exposed to sun. Other symptoms may also include pain, numbness or tingling, vomiting, constipation, and intellectual disability. Most Porphyrias are inherited conditions with either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. However, some forms of Porphyria can be caused by environmental factors such as infections or exposures to certain prescription drugs. Porphyrias caused by environmental factors are called sporadic or acquired Porphyria."
"Summary of Omphalocele-diaphragmatic hernia-cardiovascular anomalies-radial ray defect synd: Omphalocele-diaphragmatic hernia-cardiovascular anomalies-radial ray defect syndrome is a rare condition that affects babies before they are born. Babies with this condition have a large hole in their belly called an omphalocele that allows their liver and small intestine to stick out. They may also have a hole in their diaphragm, the muscle that helps them breathe (called a diaphragmatic hernia). This condition can also cause problems with the heart, such as a narrow aorta. Other symptoms include missing or fused fingers and unusual facial features. Some babies with this condition may have other problems, such as missing arteries or organs. This condition is often deadly for newborn babies."
"Summary of Familial congenital palsy of trochlear nerve: Familial congenital palsy of trochlear nerve is a rare, genetic, neuro-ophthalmological disease characterized by congenital fourth cranial nerve palsy, manifesting with hypertropia in side gaze, unexplained head tilt, acquired vertical diplopia, and progressive increase in vertical fusional vergence amplitudes with prolonged occlusion.

Some asymptomatic cases have been reported."
Summary of Primary release disorder of platelets: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Intellectual disability, Birk-Barel type: Birk-Barel syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, hyperactivity, and unusual facial features. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the KCNK9 gene on chromosome 8. This condition demonstrates dominant inheritance with paternal imprinting, which means that a genetic change in the maternal gene will result in disease, but a genetic change in the paternal gene will have no effect (imprinted with paternal silencing)."
"Summary of Paralysis agitans, juvenile, of hunt: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of 3q29 microduplication syndrome: Chromosome 3q29 microduplication syndrome is a rare chromosome abnormality characterized by having an extra copy of material (duplication) on a specific part of the long arm of chromosome 3. The signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals, but the most common features include mild or moderate intellectual disability and microcephaly. The condition may occur for the first time in the affected individual (de novo) or it can be inherited from a mildly affected or apparently normal parent."
"Summary of Brugada syndrome 3: Brugada syndrome is characterized by cardiac conduction abnormalities (ST-segment abnormalities in leads V1-V3 on ECG and a high risk for ventricular arrhythmias) that can result in sudden death. Brugada syndrome presents primarily during adulthood although age at diagnosis may range from infancy to late adulthood. The mean age of sudden death is approximately 40 years. Clinical presentations may also include sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS; death of a child during the first year of life without an identifiable cause) and the sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS), a typical presentation in individuals from Southeast Asia. Other conduction defects can include first-degree AV block, intraventricular conduction delay, right bundle branch block, and sick sinus syndrome."

"Summary of Idiopathic trachyonychia: Idiopathic trachyonychia (twenty-nail dystrophy) is a condition that affects the nails of the fingers and toes. The nails become rough, thin, and brittle. They appear similar to sandpaper. It was once thought that all 20 nails will be affected, but any number of nails can become rough and brittle. This condition most commonly occurs in childhood, but it can occur at any age. The exact cause is often unknown, but sometimes appears with other skin conditions such as lichen planus, psoriasis and alopecia areata. In some people, the symptoms of idiopathic trachyonychia improve or disappear over time, but in other people they persist for a long time."
"Summary of Dopa-responsive dystonia due to sepiapterin reductase deficiency: Dopa-responsive dystonia due to sepiapterin reductase deficiency is a neurometabolic disorder characterized by a pattern of involuntary sustained muscle contractions known as dystonia. Other common features include axial hypotonia , oculogyric crises, and delays in motor and cognitive development. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the SPR gene.

Summary of Rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Immunoglobulin G deficiency: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) deficiency is a condition that involves the immune system and is characterized by a shortage of type G antibodies. There are four different subclasses of IgG: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. People with IgG deficiency may have a decreased amount of one or more of the IgG subclasses or a shortage of other types of antibodies, which may occur in various conditions including X-linked agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency, and hyper-IgM syndrome. Individuals with IgG deficiency may have an increased susceptibility to infection, but the symptoms of this condition are variable and some people never experience any symptoms."
"Summary of Trehalase deficiency: Trehalase deficiency is a metabolic condition in which the body lacks an enzyme called trehalase and is not able to convert trehalose, a disaccharide (sugar composed of two monosaccharides) into glucose (sugar composed of one monosaccharide). Trehalose is found naturally in mushrooms, algae and insects. Trehalose may additionally be found in manufactured food products, medications, and cosmetics. For trehalose to be digested and absorbed by the digestive system, it must be broken down into glucose. Individuals with this deficiency are therefore unable to breakdown and absorb trehalose. This may lead to vomiting, abdominal discomfort and diarrhea after eating foods containing trehalose. Trehalase deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the TREH gene. Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance patterns have been described in the medical literature."
Summary of Trachoma: A chronic infection of the CONJUNCTIVA and CORNEA caused by CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS.
"Summary of Scurvy: Scurvy is a condition that develops in people who do not consume an adequate amount of vitamin C in their diet. Although Scurvy is relatively rare in the United States, it continues to be a problem in malnourished populations around the world (such as impoverished, underdeveloped third world countries). Early features of the condition include general weakness, fatigue and aching limbs."
"Summary of Rapid-onset childhood obesity-hypothalamic dysfunction-hypoventilation-autonomic: Rapid-onset childhood obesity-hypothalamic dysfunction-hypoventilation-autonomic dysregulation syndrome (ROHHAD) is a rare, serious syndrome that affects the autonomic nervous system (which controls involuntary actions like breathing and your heartbeat) and the endocrine system. As the name suggests, the key features include dramatic weight gain over a six- to 12-month period in the first 10 years of life, followed by hypothalamic dysfunction, dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system, and alveolar hypoventilation. Children with ROHHAD appear to have normal growth, development, and general health prior to onset of symptoms. The cause of ROHHAD is currently unknown."
"Summary of Digestive System Melanoma: Digestive System Melanoma refers to a melanoma starting in the stomach, intestines, salivary glands, mouth, esophagus, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, or rectum. Melanoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the melanocytes. Melanocytes are commonly found in the skin and are the cells that give the skin color. While it is not uncommon for melanomas to start in the skin and later spread to other parts of the body (metastasize), melanomas originating in the gastrointestinal tract are rare. The most frequently reported site is in the esophagus and anorectum. Symptoms of a Digestive System Melanoma may be nonspecific, including blood in the stool, stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss and anemia (low red blood cell count). The cause of Digestive System Melanoma is not well understood."
Summary of Primary malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Small cell carcinoma of the ovary: Ovarian small cell carcinoma is a rare form of ovarian cancer that typically occurs in young women. It is typically an aggressive cancer that can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. There are two types of Ovarian small cell carcinoma: hypercalcemic and pulmonary. Approximately 2/3 of individuals with Ovarian small cell carcinoma have the hypercalcemic type. Symptoms are fairly nonspecific and are similar to other types of ovarian cancer. Symptoms may include: bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, and appetite changes."
"Summary of Spitz nevus: Spitz nevus are non-cancerous skin lesions that tend to be dome-shaped, red, reddish-brown or dark colored. They usually develop on the face or limbs of young children. They tend to grow quickly initially, but then stabilize or even disappear after a period of time."
"Summary of Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. ADPKD is a progressive disease and symptoms tend to get worse over time. The most common symptoms are kidney cysts, pain in the back and the sides and headaches. Other symptoms include liver and pancreatic cysts, urinary tract infections, abnormal heart valves, high blood pressure, kidney stones, and brain aneurysms. ADPKD is most often caused by changes in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, and less often by changes in the GANAB and DNAJB11 genes. It is inherited in a dominant pattern. ADPKD is the most common inherited disorder of the kidneys."
"Summary of Goblet cell carcinoma: Goblet cell carcinoid (GCC) is a rare tumor normally occurring in the appendix which displays features of both a neuroendocrine tumor and a more aggressive form of cancer known as an adenocarcinoma. People with this tumor may develop acute appendicitis, abdominal pain, and diarrhea."
Summary of Familial breast cancer: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a condition characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood due to genetic changes in the LDLR gene. People with hypercholesterolemia have a high risk of developing a form of heart disease called coronary artery disease, as well as health problems related to the buildup of excess cholesterol in other tissues (e.g., in the tendons and skin). Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia tends to be passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion. There are other hereditary forms of hypercholesterolemia caused by genetic changes in the APOB, LDLRAP1, or PCSK9 gene. However, most cases of high cholesterol are not caused by a single inherited condition, but result from a combination of lifestyle choices and the effects of variations in many genes."
"Summary of Symptomatic form of hemochromatosis type 1: The symptomatic form of hemochromatosis type 1 is a disease in which too much iron builds up in the body. This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. While many organs can be affected, iron overload is especially likely to affect the liver, heart, and pancreas. Early symptoms of the symptomatic form of hemochromatosis type 1 can include fatigue, weakness, and joint pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, loss of sex drive, liver disease, diabetes, heart problems, and skin discoloration. The symptomatic form of hemochromatosis type 1 is the most common type of hemochromatosis, and it affects more men than women. The symptomatic form of hemochromatosis type 1 is caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants) to the HFE gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A diagnosis of the symptomatic form of hemochromatosis type 1 is suspected when a doctor observes signs and symptoms of the disease. A doctor may decide to order laboratory tests including a liver biopsy, MRI, or blood test. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Hemophilia: Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that slows the blood clotting process. People with this disorder experience prolonged bleeding following an injury, surgery, or having a tooth pulled. In severe cases, heavy bleeding occurs after minor trauma or in the absence of injury. Serious complications can result from bleeding into the joints, muscles, brain, or other internal organs. The major types of this disorder are Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B. Although the two types have very similar signs and symptoms, they are caused by genetic changes in different genes. People with an unusual form of Hemophilia B, known as Hemophilia B Leyden, experience episodes of excessive bleeding in childhood, but have few bleeding problems after puberty. Another form of the disorder, acquired Hemophilia, is not caused by inherited genetic changes."
"Summary of Myotonic dystrophy: Myotonic dystrophy is a disease that affects the muscles and other body systems. It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood, usually in a person's 20s or 30s. This disease is characterized by progressive muscle loss and weakness. Myotonic dystrophy may be further classified into two types, and the two types may affect different muscles. People with Myotonic dystrophy usually have prolonged muscle tensing (myotonia) and are not able to relax certain muscles after use. The severity of the disease may vary among affected people, even among members of the same family. Myotonic dystrophy is caused by genetic changes (changes) in the DMPK gene or the CNBP (ZNF9) gene depending on the specific type of Myotonic dystrophy. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Myotonic dystrophy may be diagnosed when a healthcare provider observes signs and symptoms of the disease, and the diagnosis may be confirmed with tests of muscle function and genetic testing."
"Summary of Neurofibromatosis: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic disease that causes tumors to develop in the nervous system. There are three types of Neurofibromatosis that are each associated with unique signs and symptoms Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) causes skin changes (cafe-au-lait spots, freckling in armpit and groin area); bone abnormalities; optic gliomas; and tumors on the nerve tissue or under the skin. Signs and symptoms are usually present at birth. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) causes acoustic neuromas; hearing loss; ringing in the ears; poor balance; brain and/or spinal tumors; and cataracts at a young age. Schwannomatosis causes schwannomas, pain, numbness, and weakness. It is the rarest type. All three types of NF are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
Summary of Skin cancer: A primary or metastatic tumor involving the skin. Primary malignant skin tumors most often are carcinomas (either basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas that arise from cells in the epidermis) or melanomas that arise from pigment-containing skin melanocytes. Metastatic tumors to the skin include carcinomas and lymphomas.
"Summary of Cholesteatoma: Cholesteatoma is an abnormal growth of skin in the middle ear behind the eardrum. It can be congenital (present from birth), but it more commonly occurs as a complication of chronic ear infections. Individuals with this condition usually experience a painless discharge from the ear. Hearing loss, dizziness, and facial muscle paralysis are rare but can result from continued Cholesteatoma growth."
"Summary of Coenzyme Q10 deficiency: Primary coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency is usually associated with multisystem involvement, including neurologic manifestations such as fatal neonatal encephalopathy with hypotonia; a late-onset slowly progressive multiple-system atrophy-like phenotype (neurodegeneration with autonomic failure and various combinations of parkinsonism and cerebellar ataxia, and pyramidal dysfunction); and dystonia, spasticity, seizures, and intellectual disability. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), the hallmark renal manifestation, is often the initial manifestation either as isolated renal involvement that progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or associated with encephalopathy (seizures, stroke-like episodes, severe neurologic impairment) resulting in early death. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), retinopathy or optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss can also be seen."
"Summary of Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy-subcortical infarcts-leukoencephalopat: Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL) is an inherited disorder in which damage to the small blood vessels in the brain leads to stroke and other impairments. Symptoms may include: muscle stiffness, personality changes, and memory loss. People with this disease may also experience dementia, hair loss (alopecia), and damage to the spinal column (spondylosis). CARASIL is caused by genetic changes in the HTRA1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia: Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is characterized by hypotrichosis (sparseness of scalp and body hair), hypohidrosis (reduced ability to sweat), and hypodontia (congenital absence of teeth). The cardinal features of classic HED become obvious during childhood. The scalp hair is thin, lightly pigmented, and slow-growing. Sweating, although present, is greatly deficient, leading to episodes of hyperthermia until the affected individual or family acquires experience with environmental modifications to control temperature. Only a few abnormally formed teeth erupt, and at a later-than-average age. Physical growth and psychomotor development are otherwise within normal limits. Mild HED is characterized by mild manifestations of any or all the characteristic features."
"Summary of Pure autonomic failure: Pure autonomic failure (PAF) is a neurodegenerative disease of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates body processes like blood pressure and breathing rate. PAF usually affects only the peripheral autonomic nervous system, which means it does not usually involve the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). Symptoms begin in midlife, although they can begin earlier. The main symptom of PAF is orthostatic hypotension, a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing. This can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, blurry vision, and weakness. Other symptoms can include fatigue, bladder problems, constipation, abnormal sweating, and sleep disorders. The symptoms of PAF tend to get worse over time, and sometimes, PAF can lead to other conditions such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. The cause of PAF is not known. The symptoms are caused by abnormal accumulations of protein, called Lewy bodies, in the cells of autonomic nerves. The Lewy bodies restrict the production and release of norepinephrine from nerve cells, which in turn causes hypotension. Diagnosis of PAF is based on the symptoms, clinical examination, and a thorough neurological examination. Testing may involve tilt table testing, 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, hyperventilation testing, and a norepinephrine blood test."
"Summary of Autosomal dominant brachyolmia: A relatively severe form of brachyolmia, a group of rare genetic skeletal disorders, characterized by short-trunked short stature, platyspondyly and kyphoscoliosis. Degenerative joint disease (osteoarthropathy) in the spine, large joints and interphalangeal joints becomes manifest in adulthood."
"Summary of Dravet syndrome: Dravet syndrome is the most severe of a group of conditions known as SCN1A-related seizure disorders. Symptoms include seizures which first occur in infancy that are often triggered by high temperatures (febrile seizures). In childhood, many types of seizures may occur and they may increase in frequency. Seizures may be difficult to treat. Other symptoms include loss of motor skills, intellectual disability, speech impairment, and difficulty with movement. Most cases of Dravet syndrome occur when the SCN1A gene is not working correctly. It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but most people with Dravet syndrome do not have a family history of the condition. Diagnosis is based on a clinical exam, medical history, and the results of genetic testing."
Summary of Endemic Kaposi sarcoma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cardiac arrhythmia, ankyrin-b-related: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac electrophysiologic disorder, characterized by QT prolongation and T-wave abnormalities on the ECG that are associated with tachyarrhythmias, typically the ventricular tachycardia torsade de pointes (TdP). TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Such cardiac events typically occur during exercise and emotional stress, less frequently during sleep, and usually without warning. In some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated) or sudden death. Approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one to a few syncopal events. While cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, they are most common from the preteen years through the 20s. Some types of LQTS are associated with a phenotype extending beyond cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to the prolonged QT interval, associations include muscle weakness and facial dysmorphism in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (LQTS type 7); hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features in Timothy syndrome (LQTS type 8); and profound sensorineural hearing loss in Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome."

"Summary of Cerebral palsy spastic quadriplegic: Cerebral palsy (CP) is defined as a nonprogressive but not unchanging disorder of posture or movement, caused by an abnormality of the brain and first evident at the stage of rapid brain development (Hughes and Newton, 1992). The most common forms result from factors surrounding difficulties before or at birth, such as severe perinatal asphyxia, congenital infection, prematurity, and multiple pregnancy (Blair and Stanley, 1988; Stanley, 1994). More rarely, familial clustering or absence of pre- or postpartum events indicate that there are genetic forms of the disorder (Lynex et al., 2004).Cerebral palsy can be classified according to the type of movement disorder: spastic cerebral palsy accounts for approximately 60% of cases and can be subdivided into hemiplegic, diplegic, quadriplegic, and monoplegic types, whereas other forms include athetoid/dyskinetic, ataxic (605388), and mixed (Gustavson et al., 1969).Genetic Heterogeneity of Spastic Quadriplegic Cerebral PalsySee also CPSQ2 (612900), caused by deletion of the ANKRD15 gene (KANK1; 607704) inherited on the paternal allele, and CPSQ3 (617008), caused by mutation in the ADD3 gene (601568) on 10q24.Related phenotypes that were formerly classified in the CPSQ series include spastic paraplegia-47 (SPG47; 614066), spastic paraplegia-50 (SPG50; 612936), spastic paraplegia-51 (SPG51; 613744), and spastic paraplegia-52 (614067)."

"Summary of Infantile dystonia-parkinsonism: Infantile dystonia-parkinsonism, also known as Dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome  or DTDS, is a rare movement disorder that causes progressive (worsening) dystonia and parkinsonism. It usually begins in infancy. Some people with this condition may not develop symptoms until childhood or later. The dystonia in infantile dystonia-parkinsonism is characterized by uncontrollable (involuntary), long-lasting muscle contractions and cramps that involve many different muscles. Dystonia causes difficulty with daily activities and impairs the ability to talk, eat, drink, pick up objects, and walk. Parkinsonism develops as the disorder progresses and is characterized by tremor (shaking), slowed movements (bradykinesia), rigidity (stiffness), and impaired balance and coordination. Additional symptoms that may be present include abnormal eye movements, reduced facial expressions, irritability, sleeping problems, digestive problems (such as reflux or constipation), and recurrent pneumonia which can be life-threatening. Infantile dystonia-parkinsonism is caused by genetic changes in the SLC6A3 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive."

"Summary of Myofibrillar myopathy: Myofibrilar myopathy (MFM) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness that can involve both proximal muscles (such as hips and shoulders) and distal muscles (those further away from the trunk). Some affected individuals also experience muscle stiffness, aching, or cramps. Other symptoms that can be associated with MFM include pain and tingling in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy) or an enlarged and weakened heart (cardiomyopathy). Most people with MFM begin to develop muscle weakness in mid-adulthood, but features of the disease can appear anytime between infancy and late adulthood. MFM is caused by a genetic change (change) in any of several genes, including DES, CRYAB,  MYOT, LDB3, FLNC, BAG3, FHL1, TTN, and DNAJB6. The signs and symptoms of MFM can vary depending on the genetic cause. For some people, the exact genetic cause may be unknown. The mode of inheritance of the disease depends on exactly which gene is changed. MFM can be diagnosed with a muscle biopsy or other studies of muscle function. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing."

"Summary of Paragangliomas 2: Paragangliomas 2 is a disease caused by a change in the SDHAF2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is needed for the proper functioning of another protein called SDHA. When SDHA doesn't work properly, it can lead to the development of paragangliomas, which are rare tumors that form near the carotid artery, along nerve pathways in the head and neck and in other parts of the body."
"Summary of Paragangliomas 3: Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma (PGL/PCC) syndromes are characterized by paragangliomas (tumors that arise from neuroendocrine tissues distributed along the paravertebral axis from the base of the skull to the pelvis) and pheochromocytomas (paragangliomas that are confined to the adrenal medulla). Sympathetic paragangliomas cause catecholamine excess; parasympathetic paragangliomas are most often nonsecretory. Extra-adrenal parasympathetic paragangliomas are located predominantly in the skull base and neck (referred to as head and neck PGL [HNPGL]) and sometimes in the upper mediastinum; approximately 95% of such tumors are nonsecretory. In contrast, sympathetic extra-adrenal paragangliomas are generally confined to the lower mediastinum, abdomen, and pelvis, and are typically secretory. Pheochromocytomas, which arise from the adrenal medulla, typically lead to catecholamine excess. Symptoms of PGL/PCC result from either mass effects or catecholamine hypersecretion (e.g., sustained or paroxysmal elevations in blood pressure, headache, episodic profuse sweating, forceful palpitations, pallor, and apprehension or anxiety). The risk for developing metastatic disease is greater for extra-adrenal sympathetic paragangliomas than for pheochromocytomas."
"Summary of Paragangliomas 4: Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma (PGL/PCC) syndromes are characterized by paragangliomas (tumors that arise from neuroendocrine tissues distributed along the paravertebral axis from the base of the skull to the pelvis) and pheochromocytomas (paragangliomas that are confined to the adrenal medulla). Sympathetic paragangliomas cause catecholamine excess; parasympathetic paragangliomas are most often nonsecretory. Extra-adrenal parasympathetic paragangliomas are located predominantly in the skull base and neck (referred to as head and neck PGL [HNPGL]) and sometimes in the upper mediastinum; approximately 95% of such tumors are nonsecretory. In contrast, sympathetic extra-adrenal paragangliomas are generally confined to the lower mediastinum, abdomen, and pelvis, and are typically secretory. Pheochromocytomas, which arise from the adrenal medulla, typically lead to catecholamine excess. Symptoms of PGL/PCC result from either mass effects or catecholamine hypersecretion (e.g., sustained or paroxysmal elevations in blood pressure, headache, episodic profuse sweating, forceful palpitations, pallor, and apprehension or anxiety). The risk for developing metastatic disease is greater for extra-adrenal sympathetic paragangliomas than for pheochromocytomas."
"Summary of Syringoma: Syringomas are firm yellowish, translucent, or skin colored papules that are often found on the face, particularly around the eyes, but may also appear elsewhere on the face, in the armpits, umbilicus, upper chest, and genitalia. They arise from the sweat ducts and may occur suddenly in crops or multiples. There are 4 types of Syringoma: a localized form, a form associated with Down syndrome, a generalized form that encompases multiple and eruptive Syringomas, and a familial form. Syringomas are usually asymptomatic; However, rarely, individuals can experience extreme itching (pruritus), especially while sweating. They are found more commonly in Caucasians, and in females at puberty or near middle-age."

"Summary of CD4+/CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm: A rare hematologic neoplasm characterized by origin from precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, with frequent cutaneous, bone marrow, and lymph node involvement, as well as leukemic dissemination. Most common clinical presentation is with asymptomatic solitary or multiple skin lesions (either isolated purplish nodules, isolated bruise-like papules, or disseminated purplish nodules/macules/papules), although some patients may present with leukemia. Skin biopsy shows a diffuse, monomorphous infiltrate of medium-sized blast cells resembling either lymphoblasts or myeloblasts, with massive involvement of the dermis. The clinical course is aggressive, and age has an adverse impact on prognosis."
"Summary of 22q11.2 duplication syndrome: 22q11.2 duplication syndrome is a condition caused by an extra copy of a small piece of chromosome 22 which contains about 30 to 40 genes. The features of this condition vary widely, even among members of the same family (intrafamilial variability). Affected individuals may have intellectual or learning disability, developmental delay, slow growth leading to short stature, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Many people with the condition have no apparent physical or intellectual disabilities. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. While many affected people inherit the condition from a parent, others are affected due to having a new genetic change that occurs for the first time. In either case, the condition can be passed on to children. The duplication is not detectable by karyotype and most cases are identified by a technique known as chromosomal microarray."
"Summary of Myoepithelial carcinoma: Myoepithelial carcinoma is a rare malignant (cancerous) tumor that usually occurs in the salivary glands in the mouth, but can also occur in skin and soft tissues. Approximately 66% of these tumors occur in a part of the salivary gland, known as the parotid gland. Symptoms of Myoepithelial carcinoma usually begin with a painless mass. Other symptoms vary depending on the site of the tumor and may include: hoarseness, nasal blockage, bleeding from the nose, pain, headaches, and facial weakness and paralysis."
"Summary of Primary interstitial lung disease specific to childhood: Children's interstitial and diffuse lung disease (chILD) is not a single condition, but a group of rare lung diseases found in infants, children and adolescents that can range from mild to severe. All types of chILD decrease a child's ability to supply oxygen to their body. These diseases make it difficult for the lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide and can cause fluid and other materials to collect in the lungs."
"Summary of AA amyloidosis: Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which a protein, called amyloid, builds up in the body's organs and tissues. Amyloidosis AA is also referred to as Secondary amyloidosis or Inflammatory amyloidosis. This disease is caused by a long-lasting infection or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, or osteomyelitis. Infection or inflammation in the body causes an increased amount of a specific protein called serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. In this disease, part of the SAA protein forms deposits called ""amyloid fibrils"". These deposits occur in the space around the cells of certain tissues of the body. Amyloidosis AA usually begins as a disease in the kidneys, but other organs can be affected such as the liver and spleen."
"Summary of Nodular cutaneous amyloidosis: Nodular cutaneous amyloidosis is a rare skin disease where there is an abnormal buildup of anyloids (insoluble protein fibrils) in the skin. It is characterized by yellowish waxy crusted nodules and papules on the face, legs, trunk, scalp, and genitalia. Primary localized cutaneous nodular amyloidosis (PLCNA) is the rarest form of primary cutaneous amyloidosis. PLCNA can be associated with connective tissue disorders such as SjÃ¶gren's syndrome and CREST syndrome."

"Summary of Adenocarcinoma of the appendix: Cancer of the appendix is very rare and is typically found incidentally during appendectomies, in about 1% of the cases. According to a report published by the National Cancer Institute, using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, appendix cancer account for about 0.4% of gastrointestinal tumors. There are several subytpes. The most common is the carcinoid type (66% of the total), with cyst-adenocarcinoma accounting for 20% and adenocarcinoma accounting for 10%. Then there are the rare forms of cancers which include adenocarcinoid, signet ring, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ganglioneuroma, and pheochromocytoma. Benign primary tumors are mainly 'mucinous epithelial neoplasms', also called adenomas, cystadenoma, and benign neoplastic mucocele. Adenocarcinoma of the appendix is a epithelial cancer of the appendix. The term 'epithelium' refers to cells that line hollow organs and glands and those that make up the outer surface of the body. Epithelial cells help to protect or enclose organs. Some produce mucus or other secretions."

"Summary of 1q21.1 microduplication syndrome: 1q21.1 microduplication is a chromosomal change in which a small amount of genetic material on chromosome 1 is abnormally copied (duplicated). The duplication occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a location designated q21.1. Some people with a 1q21.1 microduplication have developmental delay and intellectual disability that is typically mild to moderate. Individuals with this condition can also have features of autism spectrum disorder. These disorders are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills, as well as delayed development of speech and language. Expressive language skills (vocabulary and the production of speech) tend to be more impaired than receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) in affected individuals. In childhood, 1q21.1 microduplications may also be associated with an increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other behavioral problems. Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or mood disorders such as anxiety or depression occur in some affected individuals, usually during adulthood. Rarely, recurrent seizures (epilepsy) occur in people with a 1q21.1 microduplication. Some individuals with a 1q21.1 microduplication are born with malformations of the heart, including a particular combination of heart defects known as tetralogy of Fallot. Less commonly, other physical malformations such as the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) in males, inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet), or misalignment of the hip joint (hip dysplasia) are present at birth. Individuals with a 1q21.1 microduplication may also have a larger than average head size or taller than average adult stature. Some have slightly unusual facial features such as wide-set eyes or low-set ears. As adults, individuals with a 1q21.1 microduplication may be prone to develop cysts, swollen and knotted (varicose) veins, or carpal tunnel syndrome, which is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hands and fingers. However, there is no particular pattern of physical abnormalities that characterizes 1q21.1 microduplications. Signs and symptoms related to the chromosomal change vary even among affected members of the same family. Some people with the duplication have no identified physical, intellectual, or behavioral abnormalities. This disease summary is from MedlinePlus Genetics, an online health information resource from the National Institutes of Health."
"Summary of 19q13.11 microdeletion syndrome: Chromosome 19q13.11 deletion syndrome is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing (deleted) copy of genetic material on chromosome 19 at a location designated q13.11. People affected by this condition may have poor growth, severe feeding difficulties shortly after birth, developmental delay, learning disabilities, microcephaly (an unusually small head), hypospadias, and skin abnormalities. To date, all cases of Chromosome 19q13.11 deletion syndrome appear to be sporadic and diagnosed in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Acute infantile liver failure due to synthesis defect of mtDNA-encoded proteins: Acute infantile liver failure resulting from TRMU mutation is a transient disorder of hepatic function. In addition to elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, vomiting, coagulopathy, and hyperbilirubinemia, the presence of increased serum lactate is consistent with a defect in mitochondrial respiratory function. With supportive care, patients who survive the initial acute episode can recover and show normal development (Zeharia et al., 2009).See also transient infantile mitochondrial myopathy (MMIT; 500009), which is a similar disorder.A more severe, permanent disorder with some overlapping features is associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion (251880).See ILFS1 (615438) for information on syndromic infantile liver failure."

"Summary of Androgen insensitivity syndrome, mild: This section is currently in development."
"Summary of Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome: Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. People with this condition are genetically male (one X and one Y chromosome) but do not respond to male hormones at all. As a result, they generally have normal female external genitalia and female breasts. However, they do not have a uterus or cervix so are unable to menstruate or conceive children. Other signs and symptoms may include undescended testes and sparse to absent pubic hair. Gender identity is typically female. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is caused by changes in the AR gene and is inherited in an X-linked manner."
"Summary of Carotid body tumor: A benign or malignant extra-adrenal parasympathetic paraganglioma arising from paraganglia adjacent to or in the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. Most patients present with a slow growing, painless mass in the neck."
"Summary of Glomus jugulare tumors: A glomus jugulare tumor develops when cells in nerves near the temporal bone of the skull begin to rapidly increase in number, forming a mass. This tumor gets its name from the nerves, called glomus bodies, and their location in a small opening in the temporal bone, known as the jugulare foramen. Glomus jugulare tumors are included in a group of tumors called paragangliomas. They are usually benign, meaning cells in the tumor are unlikely to spread to other parts of the body. Symptoms of a glomus jugulare tumor include dizziness, difficulty swallowing, hearing issues, pain, or weakness in the muscles of the face."
"Summary of Pituitary hormone deficiency, combined 1: Combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) in man denotes impaired production of growth hormone (GH; 139250) and one or more of the other 5 anterior pituitary hormones. Mutations of the POU1F1 gene in the human and Pit1 in the mouse are responsible for pleiotropic deficiencies of GH, prolactin (PRL; 176760), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; see 188540), while the production of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH; see 176830), luteinizing hormone (LH; 152780), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; 136530) are preserved (Wu et al., 1998). In infancy severe growth deficiency from birth as well as distinctive facial features with prominent forehead, marked midfacial hypoplasia with depressed nasal bridge, deep-set eyes, and a short nose with anteverted nostrils and hypoplastic pituitary gland by MRI examination can be seen (Aarskog et al., 1997). Some cases present with severe mental retardation along with short stature (Radovick et al., 1992).Genetic Heterogeneity of Combined Pituitary Hormone DeficiencyCPHD2 (262600), associated with hypogonadism, is caused by mutation in the PROP1 gene (601538). CPHD3 (221750), which is associated with rigid cervical spine and variable sensorineural deafness, is caused by mutation in the LHX3 gene (600577). CPHD4 (262700) is caused by mutation in the LHX4 gene (602146). CPHD5 (see septooptic dysplasia, 182230) is caused by mutation in the HESX1 gene (601802). CPHD6 (613986) is caused by mutation in the OTX2 gene (600037)."
"Summary of Combined pituitary hormone deficiencies, genetic forms: Combined pituitary hormone deficiencies, genetic forms, also known as congenital hypopituitarism, is a rare condition that affects the pituitary gland. This condition is caused by mutations in the genes that are involved in the development of the pituitary gland before birth. People with congenital hypopituitarism have a deficiency in multiple hormones that are produced by the pituitary gland. These hormones include growth hormone (somatotroph), thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotroph), prolactin (lactotroph), adrenocorticotropic hormone (corticotroph), gonadotropins (gonadotroph). Compared to other causes of hypopituitarism, such as pituitary tumors, surgery, or radiation, congenital hypopituitarism is rare."

This severe form of cleidocranial dysplasia can cause a person to be shorter than average. Other symptoms may include absent collarbones, flattened skull, and problems with the spine."
"Summary of Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda: Autosomal domiant spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (autosomal dominant SEDT) is an inherited condition that affects bone growth. Signs and symptoms are generally physically apparent by puberty; however, abnormalities may be seen on X-ray at an earlier age. Some cases of autosomal dominant SEDT may be caused by changes in the COL2A1 gene. As the name suggests, the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Complement component 8 deficiency, type ii: Patients with deficiency of C8 suffer from recurrent neisserial infections, predominantly with meningococcus infection of rare serotypes. Most such patients are discovered among those having their first episode of meningitis at ages older than 10 years (Ross and Densen, 1984).Two types of inherited C8 deficiency have been reported in man: type I (613790), in which only C8 alpha (C8A, 120950) and C8 gamma (C8G; 120930) are deficient, and type II, in which only C8 beta is deficient (Marcus et al., 1982; Tedesco et al., 1983). The 2 types are clinically indistinguishable (Ross and Densen, 1984)."

Summary of Congenital tufting enteropathy: Congenital Tufting Enteropathy is a rare congenital enteropathy presenting with early-onset severe and intractable diarrhea that leads to irreversible intestinal failure.
"Summary of Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma: A rare low-grade astrocytoma characterized by superficial location in the cerebral hemispheres with involvement of the meninges, composed of GFAP-expressing cells showing nuclear and cytoplasmic pleomorphism and xanthomatous change, surrounded by a reticulin network. The tumor corresponds to WHO grade II and typically affects children and young adults, who often present with a long history of seizures. Extent of resection and mitotic index are important prognostic factors."
"Summary of Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma: A rare low-grade astrocytoma characterized by a benign, slowly growing lesion typically arising in the wall of the lateral ventricles, composed of large ganglioid astrocytes. The tumor corresponds to WHO grade I and typically occurs during the first two decades of life in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. Most patients present with worsening of epilepsy or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure."
"Summary of Myxopapillary ependymoma: Myxopapillary ependymoma (MEPN) is a slow-growing ependymoma (a type of glioma, which is a tumor that arises from the supportive tissue of the brain and spinal cord). They tend to occur in the lower part of the spinal column and are usually considered to be benign, low-grade or grade I tumors. Symptoms of an ependymoma are related to the location and size of the tumor and may include nausea, vomiting, headache, pain, numbness, bowel or bladder symptoms, and various other signs and symptoms. The cause of ependymomas is unknown. They are known to recur locally (more commonly in individuals diagnosed in childhood)."
"Summary of Anaplastic ependymoma: Anaplastic ependymoma is a type of ependymoma, which is a tumor that forms when cells in the central nervous system (including the brain and spinal cord) begin to multiply rapidly. An ependymoma is anaplastic if the cells grow very quickly and are significantly unusual in shape. Ependymomas can occur at any age. When ependymomas occur in children, they are more frequently located in the brain (intracranial). Ependymomas are more often found in the spinal cord of affected adults. The exact cause of an Anaplastic ependymoma is not known, but it is thought that certain changes (acquired pathogenic variants, also known as somatic genetic changes ) in specific genes in some cells of the body allow the cells to begin growing quickly. A diagnosis of Anaplastic ependymoma is generally suspected based on imaging with MRI or CT scan. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a biopsy of the tumor or when the tumor is removed (resected)."
"Summary of Astroblastoma: Astroblastoma is a rare glial tumor usually located in the cerebral hemisphere of the brain. It can occur in individuals of any age, but occurs predominantly in children and young adults. Signs and symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor but most commonly include headaches and seizures. Because these tumors are rare, there is little known regarding their behavior and how they should be managed. Adjuvant therapy, including radiation and/or chemotherapy, is recommended for high-grade and recurrent cases (although its effectiveness is controversial)."
"Summary of Chordoid glioma of the third ventricle: A rare, slow-growing neuroepithelial neoplasm of uncertain origin affecting adults. It is located in the third ventricle. It is characterized by the presence of epithelioid cells which express GFAP, and mucinous stroma which contains lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates."
"Summary of Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma: Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma is a brain tumor that forms when two types of cells in the brain, called oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, rapidly increase in number to form a mass. These brain cells are known as glial cells, which normally protect and support nerve cells in the brain. Because an oligoastrocytoma is made up of a combination of two cell types, it is known as a mixed glioma. An oligoastrocytoma is described as anaplastic when the tumor grows quickly and the cancer cells within the tumor have the potential to spread into surrounding brain tissue or to more distant parts of the body. The exact cause of this condition is unknown."
"Summary of Gangliocytoma: Gangliocytoma is a rare type of central nervous system (CNS) tumor made up of mature neurons. The most common site is the temporal lobe of the brain, but they can arise anywhere in the CNS including the cerebellum, brainstem, floor of the third ventricle, and spinal cord. They are among the most frequent tumors associated with epilepsy. Signs and symptoms may depend on the tumor's location and may include seizures (most commonly); increased brain pressure; endocrine disorders; and focal symptoms. Gangliocytomas are generally slow-growing and usually do not become malignant."
"Summary of Anaplastic ganglioglioma: Anaplastic ganglioglioma (AGG) is a very rare type of brain tumor that is a type of ganglioglioma. In general, gangliogliomas are classified as grade I or low grade tumors, meaning that they grow slowly and are considered benign. Anaplastic gangliogliomas, however, are considered grade III or high grade tumors, which means that they are usually aggressive, malignant tumors."
"Summary of Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor: A rare mixed neuronal-glial tumor characterized by a benign, usually supratentorial lesion with predominantly cortical location and multinodular architecture. The tumor typically becomes symptomatic in the second or third decade of life with drug-resistant partial seizures. Histological hallmark is the specific glioneuronal element, columns oriented perpendicularly to the cortical surface, formed by bundles of axons attached to oligodendroglia-like cells, while neurons appear to float in an abundant eosinophilic matrix."
"Summary of Central neurocytoma: Central neurocytoma is a very rare brain tumor of young adults (over 100 cases reported worldwide). It is typically found in the lateral ventricles and occasionally in the third ventricle. Symptoms are those of increased intracranial pressure: headache, nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, vision problems and mental changes. Total removal of the tumor is the therapy of choice. Post-operative prognosis is generally good."
"Summary of Cerebellar liponeurocytoma: Cerebellar liponeurocytoma (cLPN) is a rare slow growing neuronal tumor seen more frequently in females than males, occurring most commonly in the cerebellum but occasionally in the supratentorial compartment or the fourth ventricle and presenting in the 4th to 6th decade of life with symptoms of dizziness, headache and gait instability. It often has a high rate of local recurrence."
"Summary of Carney-Stratakis syndrome: Carney-Stratakis syndrome is a recently described familial syndrome characterized by gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and paragangliomas, often at multiple sites."
"Summary of Pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differenciation: Pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation (PPTID) describes a rare type of pineal parenchymal tumor (PPT) of intermediate-grade malignancy manifesting with visual disturbances, headaches, loss of coordination and balance, nausea and vomiting due to obstructive hydrocephalus, and that is classified as either grade II PPTID or grade III PPTID according to the degree of neuronal differentiation and mitotic activity."
"Summary of Teratoma with malignant transformation: A Teratoma with malignant transformation (TMT) is a tumor that develops from germ cells when they grow and divide abnormally, forming a mass. Approximately 6% of teratomas develop into TMTs by a process called malignant transformation, when some of the cells in the teratoma become cancerous. TMTs can occur anywhere in the body, but most are located in the testes in men or ovaries in women. The cause of TMT is unknown."
"Summary of Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia-cone-rod dystrophy syndrome: Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia-cone-rod dystrophy syndrome is characterised by the association of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (marked by platyspondyly, shortening of the tubular bones and progressive metaphyseal irregularity and cupping), with postnatal growth retardation and progressive visual impairment due to cone-rod dystrophy. So far, it has been described in eight individuals. Transmission appears to be autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Retinal cone dystrophy 3a: Achromatopsia is characterized by reduced visual acuity, pendular nystagmus, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), a small central scotoma, eccentric fixation, and reduced or complete loss of color discrimination. All individuals with achromatopsia (achromats) have impaired color discrimination along all three axes of color vision corresponding to the three cone classes: the protan or long-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (red), the deutan or middle-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (green), and the tritan or short-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (blue). Most individuals have complete achromatopsia, with total lack of function of all three types of cones. Rarely, individuals have incomplete achromatopsia, in which one or more cone types may be partially functioning. The manifestations are similar to those of individuals with complete achromatopsia, but generally less severe. Hyperopia is common in achromatopsia. Nystagmus develops during the first few weeks after birth followed by increased sensitivity to bright light. Best visual acuity varies with severity of the disease; it is 20/200 or less in complete achromatopsia and may be as high as 20/80 in incomplete achromatopsia. Visual acuity is usually stable over time; both nystagmus and sensitivity to bright light may improve slightly. Although the fundus is usually normal, macular changes (which may show early signs of progression) and vessel narrowing may be present in some affected individuals. Defects in the macula are visible on optical coherence tomography."
"Summary of Cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response: Cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response (CDSRR) is an inherited retinopathy, with an onset in the first or second decade of life, characterized by poor visual acuity (due to central scotoma), photophobia, severe dyschromatopsia, and occasionally, nystagmus. Night blindness usually develops later in the course of the disease, but it can also be apparent from childhood. A hallmark of CDSRR is the decreased and delayed dark-adapted response to dim flashes in electroretinographic recordings, which contrasts with the supernormal b-wave response at the highest levels of stimulation."
"Summary of Retinal cone dystrophy 4: Retinal cone dystrophy 4 is a genetic disease that affects the eyes. People with this disease have changes in the CACNA2D4 gene on chromosome 12p13. This change affects the function of the cones in the retina, which can lead to a slowly progressive reduction in vision and photophobia (sensitivity to light). Retinal cone dystrophy 4 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease."
"Summary of Cone-rod dystrophy 1: Cone-rod dystrophy is a group of related eye disorders that causes vision loss, which becomes more severe over time. These disorders affect the retina, which is the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In people with cone-rod dystrophy, vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate.The first signs and symptoms of cone-rod dystrophy, which often occur in childhood, are usually decreased sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). These features are typically followed by impaired color vision (dyschromatopsia), blind spots (scotomas) in the center of the visual field, and partial side (peripheral) vision loss. Over time, affected individuals develop night blindness and a worsening of their peripheral vision, which can limit independent mobility. Decreasing visual acuity makes reading increasingly difficult and most affected individuals are legally blind by mid-adulthood. As the condition progresses, individuals may develop involuntary eye movements (nystagmus).There are more than 30 types of cone-rod dystrophy, which are distinguished by their genetic cause and their pattern of inheritance: autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and X-linked. Additionally, cone-rod dystrophy can occur alone without any other signs and symptoms or it can occur as part of a syndrome that affects multiple parts of the body."
"Summary of Cone-rod dystrophy, x-linked, 1: Cone-rod dystrophy, x-linked, 1 is a rare, progressive visual disorder that primarily affects the cone photoreceptors in the eyes. This disease is more common in males. 
Symptoms of this condition include blurry vision, nearsightedness (myopia), sensitivity to light (photophobia), difficulty distinguishing colors, loss of side vision, weak response to bright light, and changes to the part of the eye responsible for central vision. The severity of the condition can vary, with some people experiencing more damage to the rods (cells in the eye that help us see in low light).
Symptoms may appear at different ages and can vary in serverity."
"Summary of Cone-rod dystrophy 3: Cone-rod dystrophy-3 (CORD3) is an autosomal recessive, clinically heterogeneous retinal disorder with typical findings of reduced visual acuity, impairment of the central visual field, color vision deficits, and fundoscopic evidence of maculopathy, with no or few midperipheral retinal pigment deposits. Cone degeneration appears early in life with a central involvement of the retina, followed by a degeneration of rods several years later (summary by Klevering et al., 2002 and Ducroq et al., 2002). Both cone and rod a- and b-wave electroretinogram (ERG) amplitudes are reduced (Fishman et al., 2003).For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of cone-rod dystrophy, see 120970."
"Summary of Cone-rod dystrophy, x-linked, 3: Cone-rod dystrophy, x-linked, 3 is a disease that affects the retina, a part of the eye. This disease mainly affects the cones in the retina, which help us see colors and fine details. Sometimes, the rods in the retina, which help us see in low light, can also be affected. People with this disease often have trouble seeing clearly, are sensitive to bright lights, and have difficulty seeing colors. These symptoms can happen all at once or develop over time. This disease is caused by a change in the CACNA1F gene. It follows an x-linked pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Cone-rod dystrophy 5: Cone-rod dystrophy is a group of related eye disorders that causes vision loss, which becomes more severe over time. These disorders affect the retina, which is the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.

"Summary of Baroreflex failure: Baroreflex failure is a rare disorder that causes fluctuations in blood pressure with episodes of severe hypertension (high blood pressure) and elevated heart rate in response to stress, exercise, and pain. Individuals may also have hypotension (low blood pressure) with normal or reduced heart rate during periods of rest. Symptoms of Baroreflex failure may include headache, sweating, and a heart rate that does not respond to medications. In many cases, the cause of Baroreflex failure is not known."

"Summary of Autosomal dominant focal dystonia, DYT25 type: A form of focal dystonia affecting the face and especially the jaw that is induced by the act of speaking. It is an involuntary contraction of the masticatory muscles, resulting in dysarthria or dysphagia."
"Summary of Cervical dystonia: Cervical dystonia is a neurological condition characterized by excessive pulling of the muscles of the neck and shoulder resulting in abnormal movements of the head (dystonia). Most commonly, the head turns to one side or the other. Tilting sideways, or to the back or front may also occur. The turning or tilting movements may be accompanied by shaking movement (tremor) and/or soreness of the muscles of the neck and shoulders. Cervical dystonia can occur at any age, but most cases occur in middle age. The cause of Cervical dystonia is often unknown. In some cases there is a family history. Several genes have been associated with Cervical dystonia, including GNAL, THAP1, CIZ1, and ANO3. Other cases may be linked to an underlying disease (e.g. Parkinson disease), neck trauma, or certain medications."

"Summary of Mucoepidermoid carcinoma: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of cancer of the salivary glands. Salivary gland cancer is diagnosed in 2-3 individuals per 100,000 people each year, and 30-35% of these are Mucoepidermoid carcinomas. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma develops when a cell randomly acquires changes in genes that regulate how the cell divides such that it begins to grow quickly, forming a cluster of cells (a mass or lump). The earliest signs of a Mucoepidermoid carcinoma may include a lump in the face, neck, or mouth; numbness, weakness, or pain in part of the face; or difficulty swallowing."
Summary of Cardioencephalomyopathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Metachromatic leukodystrophy due to saposin B deficiency: Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an inherited disorder characterized by the accumulation of fats called sulfatides in cells. This accumulation especially affects cells in the nervous system that produce myelin, the substance that insulates and protects nerves. Nerve cells covered by myelin make up a tissue called white matter. Sulfatide accumulation in myelin-producing cells causes progressive destruction of white matter (leukodystrophy) throughout the nervous system, including in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system) and the nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound (the peripheral nervous system).In people with metachromatic leukodystrophy, white matter damage causes progressive deterioration of intellectual functions and motor skills, such as the ability to walk. Affected individuals also develop loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy), incontinence, seizures, paralysis, an inability to speak, blindness, and hearing loss. Eventually they lose awareness of their surroundings and become unresponsive. While neurological problems are the primary feature of metachromatic leukodystrophy, effects of sulfatide accumulation on other organs and tissues have been reported, most often involving the gallbladder.The most common form of metachromatic leukodystrophy, affecting about 50 to 60 percent of all individuals with this disorder, is called the late infantile form. This form of the disorder usually appears in the second year of life. Affected children lose any speech they have developed, become weak, and develop problems with walking (gait disturbance). As the disorder worsens, muscle tone generally first decreases, and then increases to the point of rigidity. Individuals with the late infantile form of metachromatic leukodystrophy typically do not survive past childhood.In 20 to 30 percent of individuals with metachromatic leukodystrophy, onset occurs between the age of 4 and adolescence. In this juvenile form, the first signs of the disorder may be behavioral problems and increasing difficulty with schoolwork. Progression of the disorder is slower than in the late infantile form, and affected individuals may survive for about 20 years after diagnosis.The adult form of metachromatic leukodystrophy affects approximately 15 to 20 percent of individuals with the disorder. In this form, the first symptoms appear during the teenage years or later. Often behavioral problems such as alcoholism, drug abuse, or difficulties at school or work are the first symptoms to appear. The affected individual may experience psychiatric symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations. People with the adult form of metachromatic leukodystrophy may survive for 20 to 30 years after diagnosis. During this time there may be some periods of relative stability and other periods of more rapid decline.Metachromatic leukodystrophy gets its name from the way cells with an accumulation of sulfatides appear when viewed under a microscope. The sulfatides form granules that are described as metachromatic, which means they pick up color differently than surrounding cellular material when stained for examination."
Summary of Fetal Gaucher disease: Fetal Gaucher disease is the perinatal lethal form of Gaucher disease (GD; see this term).
"Summary of UMOD-related autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease: UMOD-related autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD-UMOD) is an inherited disorder that causes a gradual loss of kidney function. Patients with ADTKD-UMOD have high blood levels of uric acid before kidney failure develops, and some affected individuals may develop gout. Gout is a form of arthritis (inflammation) that occurs often in the big toe, ankle, knee, or other joints. ADTKD-UMOD is caused by a mistake in the UMOD gene, which leads to the build-up of the altered uromodulin protein in the tubules of the kidney, leading to slow loss of kidney function. ADTKD-UMOD is inherited in a dominant pattern in families. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms, laboratory testing, family history and genetic testing."
"Summary of Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B: Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B (PHP1B) is a disorder characterized by lack of response (resistance) to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other hormones such as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Resistance mainly occurs in the kidneys, causing low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia), high blood phosphate levels (hyperphosphatemia), and elevated PTH levels (hyperparathyroidism). Some people with PHP1B also have elevated TSH levels due to TSH resistance. Severity can vary considerably, even among people in the same family. Symptoms usually begin in childhood due to low calcium levels and may include numbness, seizures, tetany, cataracts, and dental problems. Excessive growth or weight has been described in some newborns or during early infancy and childhood. Some children have skeletal problems, such as reduced bone mineral density and osteitis fibrosa. The inheritance and genetics of PHP1B is complex. PHP1B is usually sporadic (not inherited), but familial cases with autosomal dominant inheritance, from the mother only, have been reported. When the parent from which a gene is inherited affects the way a gene acts, it is called genomic imprinting. PHP1B may be caused by randomly inheriting both copies of the long arm of chromosome 20 from the father rather than a copy from each parent (paternal 20q disomy), genetic changes or epigenetic changes involving the GNAS or STX16 gene, or by unidentified genetic or epigenetic factors."
"Summary of Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1C: Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1C is a genetic disorder that is very similar to hypoparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone levels are too low). However, pseudohypoparathyroidism is caused by no response to parathyroid hormone rather than having too little of the hormone itself. This causes low calcium and high phosphate levels in the blood. This condition is also associated with a group of symptoms referred to as Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy, which includes short stature, a round face, obesity, and short hand bones. This disorder is different than pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A because people with type 1C do not have abnormal activity of a particular protein (stimulatory protein G (Gs alpha)). Type 1C is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is caused by a specific spelling mistake in the GNAS gene."
"Summary of Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 2: Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 2 (PHP2) is a type of pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP; see this term) characterized by resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH), which manifests with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and elevated PTH levels, absence of Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO; see this term), and normal expression of the Gs protein with a normal urinary cAMP response."
"Summary of Primary lateral sclerosis: Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare neuromuscular disease that affects the nerve cells that control the voluntary muscles. Problems in the legs (such as weakness, stiffness, spasticity, and balance problems) are often observed first, but hand clumsiness and changes in speech can be early symptoms, as well. The underlying cause of adult PLS is currently unknown. In most cases, it occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. A subtype of PLS, called juvenile PLS, is caused by changes in the ALS2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Chilaiditi syndrome: Chilaiditi syndrome is a medical condition in which a portion of the colon is abnormally positioned between the liver and the diaphragm. Symptoms vary, but may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and small bowel obstruction. In many cases, there are no symptoms and the interposition is an incidental finding. When no symptoms are present, the clinical finding is called Chilaiditi's sign.. The underlying cause of Chilaiditi syndrome is unknown."
"Summary of Neuroferritinopathy: Neuroferritinopathy is a movement disorder caused by the gradual accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia of the brain. People with Neuroferritinopathy have progressive problems with movement that begin at about age 40. These movement problems can include involuntary jerking motions (chorea), rhythmic shaking (tremor), difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), or uncontrolled tensing of muscles (dystonia). Symptoms of the disorder may be more prominent on one side of the body. Affected individuals may also have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and speaking (dysarthria). Intelligence is generally unaffected, but some individuals develop a gradual decline in thinking and reasoning abilities (dementia). Personality changes such as reduced inhibitions and difficulty controlling emotions may also occur as the disorder progresses. Neuroferritinopathy is caused by genetic changes in the FTL gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."
Summary of Mungan syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation 2b: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation 2b is a disease that affects the brain. It is caused by changes in a gene called PLA2G6.

"Summary of Orofaciodigital syndrome: Orofaciodigital syndromes refers to numerous conditions in which the oral cavity (mouth, tongue, teeth, and jaw), facial structures (head, eyes, and nose), and digits (fingers and toes) may be formed differently. When changes happen to many different parts of the body, this is called a syndrome. The literature reports up to thirteen types of orofaciodigital syndrome, but research is necessary to confirm and clarify all of these types. For most of the types the exact cause of the condition is unknown. These types are defined by certain symptoms or characteristics in addition to the those affecting the oral cavity, facial structures, and digits."
"Summary of Orofaciodigital syndrome type 12: Orofaciodigital syndrome type 12 is a rare subtype of orofaciodigital syndrome, with sporadic occurrence, characterized by cardiac (septum hypertrophy) and central nervous system abnormalities (myelomeningocele, Sylvius aqueduct stenosis, corpus callosum agenesis, vermis hypoplasia), in addition to oral, facial and digital malformations (gingival frenulae, bifid tongue, supernumerary teeth, macrocephaly, hypertelorism, pre- and post-axial polydactyly in hands, preaxial polydactyly in feet and club feet). Skeletal anomalies, such as short tibiae and central, Y-shaped metacarpals, are also associated."
"Summary of Orofaciodigital syndrome type 13: Orofaciodigital syndrome type 13 is a rare subtype of orofaciodigital syndrome, with sporadic occurrence, characterized by cardiac (mitral and tricuspid valve dysplasia) and neuropsychiatric manifestations (epilepsy, depression), in addition to oral, facial and digital malformations (lingual hamartomas, cleft lip, brachydactyly, clinodactyly, syndactyly of hands and feet).

"Summary of Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1 (PCH1) is a genetic disease that affects the development of the brain. Babies and children with this disease have an unusually small and underdeveloped cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement. A region of the brain called the pons also fails to develop properly. The pons, which is located at the base of the brain in an area called the brainstem, sends signals between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain. Individuals with PCH1 also experience a degeneration of the anterior horn cells, which are responsible for helping the spinal cord send signals to the muscles. Problems with the anterior horn cells cause severe muscle weakness. PCH1 is caused by genetic changes to EXOSC3, TSEN54, RARS2, and VRK1. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis of PCH1 is based on brain imaging and tests to rule out other causes of problems with brain development."
"Summary of Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (PCH2) is a rare condition that affects the development of the brain. Signs and symptoms vary but may include microcephaly, developmental delay with lack of voluntary motor development, intellectual disability and movement disorders (i.e. chorea, dystonia, and spasticity). Affected people may also experience dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), impaired vision, seizures and an inability to communicate. PCH2 is caused by changes in the TSEN54, TSEN2, TSEN34, or SEPSECS gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

Movement disorders, as seen in other forms of PCH, are absent."
"Summary of Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 5: TSEN54 pontocerebellar hypoplasia (TSEN54-PCH) comprises three PCH phenotypes (PCH2, 4, and 5) that share characteristic neuroradiologic and neurologic findings. The three PCH phenotypes (which differ mainly in life expectancy) were considered to be distinct entities before their molecular basis was known. PCH2. Children usually succumb before age ten years (those with PCH4 and 5 usually succumb as neonates). Children with PCH2 have generalized clonus, uncoordinated sucking and swallowing, impaired cognitive development, lack of voluntary motor development, cortical blindness, and an increased risk for rhabdomyolysis during severe infections. Epilepsy is present in approximately 50%. PCH4. Neonates often have seizures, multiple joint contractures (\""arthrogryposis\""), generalized clonus, and central respiratory impairment. PCH5 resembles PCH4 and has been described in one family."
"Summary of Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6: A rare, genetic form of pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) characterized by neocortical and severe cerebral cortical atrophy associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia with the pons and cerebellum equally affected. Clinically the disorder manifests at birth with hypotonia, clonus, epilepsy impaired swallowing and from infancy by progressive microcephaly, spasticity and lactic acidosis."
"Summary of Progressive transformation of germinal centers: Progressive transformation of germinal centers is a condition in which a lymph node becomes very enlarged (lymphadenopathy). Typically, only one lymph node is affected, though PTGC can involve multiple lymph nodes. The neck is the most common location of affected lymph nodes, but PTGC may also affect lymph nodes in the groin and armpits. Adults are more frequently affected than children, but children have a higher chance of developing PTGC multiple times (recurrence). PTGC is not considered a precancerous condition, though it has been associated with Hodgkin lymphoma."
"Summary of Pudendal neuralgia: Pudendal Neuralgia occurs when the pudendal nerve is injured, irritated, or compressed. Symptoms include burning pain (often unilateral), tingling, or numbness in any of the following areas: buttocks, genitals, or perineum (area between the buttocks and genitals). Symptoms are typically present when a person is sitting but often go away when the person is standing or lying down. The pain tends to increase as the day progresses. Additional symptoms include pain during sex and needing to urinate frequently and/or urgently. Damage to the pudendal nerve can result from surgical procedures, childbirth, trauma, spasms of the pelvic floor muscles, or tumors. Pudendal Neuralgia may also result from certain infections (such as herpes simplex infections) or certain activities (such as cycling and squatting exercises). There are no imaging studies that diagnose Pudendal Neuralgia; however, MRI and CT may help to exclude other causes of the pain."
"Summary of Legius syndrome: Legius syndrome, also known as NF1-like syndrome, is a rare, genetic skin pigmentation disorder characterized by multiple cafÃ©-au-lait macules with or without axillary or inguinal freckling."
"Summary of Diploid-triploid mosaicism: Diploid-triploid mosaicism (DSM) is a genetic condition caused by an abnormal number of chromosomes. Symptoms of this condition may include decreased muscle tone (hypotonia), slow growth, characteristic facial features, fusion or webbing between the fingers and/or toes (syndactyly), and unusual skin pigmentation. Intellectual disabilities may be present. DSM occurs when a person has some cells with three copies of each chromosome for a total of 69 chromosomes (triploid cells) and some cells with the usual 2 copies of each chromosome for a total of 46 chromosomes (diploid cells). Having two or more different cell types is called mosaicism. Diagnosis is made through a clinical exam and a skin biopsy."
"Summary of HSD10 disease: HSD10 disease (also known as 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric aciduria) is an inherited disorder in which the body cannot effectively process the amino acid isoleucine. Signs and symptoms of this condition usually develop in infancy or early childhood and include metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, seizures, movement problems, retinal degeneration, and hearing loss. Affected males have severe neurodegeneration with loss of developmental milestones, whereas females have mild to moderate developmental delay. HSD10 disease is caused by genetic changes in the HSD17B10 gene; it has an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance."
Summary of Hydroxyprolinemia: Hydroxyprolinemia is an inherited metabolic condition characterized by elevated levels of the amino acid hydroxyproline in the blood and urine. This condition usually does not cause physical or cognitive abnormalities. Hydroxyprolinemia was initially described in association with intellectual disabilities; however it has also been reported in cognitively normal individuals and is thus thought to be begnin. Hydroxyprolinemia is thought to be an autosomal recessive condition.
"Summary of Heinz body anemias: This is a form of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia of Dacie type I (in vitro autohemolysis is not corrected by added glucose). After splenectomy, which has little benefit, basophilic inclusions called Heinz bodies are demonstrable in the erythrocytes. Before splenectomy, diffuse or punctate basophilia may be evident. Most of these cases are probably instances of hemoglobinopathy. The hemoglobin demonstrates heat lability.Heinz bodies are observed also with the Ivemark syndrome (asplenia with cardiovascular anomalies; 208530)."
"Summary of Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair: Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair is characterized by facial features suggestive of Noonan syndrome (macrocephaly, high forehead, wide-set eyes or hypertelorism, palpebral ptosis, and low-set and posteriorly rotated ears) along with hair that resembles loose anagen hair syndrome (pluckable, sparse, thin and slow-growing). Other features include frequent congenital heart defects, distinctive skin features (darkly pigmented skin with eczema or ichthyosis), short stature which may be associated with a growth hormone deficiency, and developmental delays. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the SHOC2 gene. It follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Trichuriasis: An infection that is caused by the nematode Trichuris trichiura, a soil-transmitted helminth, which is transmitted via food and/or water contaminated with the eggs of the worm. Symptoms are usually mild and include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and possibly anemia secondary to blood loss in diarrhea."

Summary of Odontogenic myxoma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Koolen-De Vries syndrome: Koolen de Vries syndrome is a disorder characterized by developmental delay, mild to moderate intellectual disability, congenital malformations, and behavioral features. Other problems include weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in childhood, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and distinctive facial features. Males with Koolen de Vries syndrome often have undescended testes (cryptorchidism). Other symptoms may include defects in the walls between the chambers of the heart (septal defects) or other heart defects, kidney problems, and skeletal anomalies such as foot deformities. It is caused by genetic changes in the KANSL1 gene, or by the loss of a small amount of genetic material in chromosome 17 that includes the KANSL1 gene (chromosome 17 q21.31 microdeletion). Inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Fatal congenital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to glycogen storage disease: Fatal congenital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to glycogen storage disease is a rare disease that affects babies before or after birth. It is characterized by severe heart problems, breathing difficulties, and failure to thrive. Other symptoms include facial abnormalities, cataracts, enlarged kidneys, and muscle problems. This disease is often fatal during infancy."
"Summary of Chronic visceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency: Chronic visceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency is an inherited condition involving lipid metabolism. People with this condition experience a build up of lipids in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and brain. Signs and symptoms typically develop in the pre-teen years and may include enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), short stature, problems with lung function including frequent lung infections, and a low number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). Chronic visceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency is caused by changes (genetic changes or variants) in the SMPD1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
Summary of Pyridoxal phosphate-responsive seizures: Pyridoxal phosphate-responsive seizures (or Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent epilepsy) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder. Babies born with this disorder are not able to make enough Vitamin B6 and this causes the baby to start having seizures soon after they are born (also called early onset or neonatal onset seizures). Pyridoxal phosphate-responsive seizures is caused by changes in the PNPO gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis is suspected by early onset of seizures which are not controlled by normal anti-seizure medications. Genetic testing is used to confirm the diagnosis.
Summary of McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome: McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome is primarily a neurological disorder that occurs almost exclusively in males. Only about 150 cases have been reported worldwide. This condition affects movement in many parts of the body. People with this condition also have abnormal star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis). This condition is one of a group of disorders called neuroacanthocytoses that involve neurological problems and abnormal red blood cells. McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion and is caused by genetic changes in the XK gene.
"Summary of Leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts: Leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts is a rare genetic disease that affects the small blood vessels in the brain. It is characterized by damage to brain tissue (specifically white matter), calcium build up in brain tissue (cerbral calcifcation), and fluid-filled sacs within brain tissue (cerbral cysts). The cerebral cysts may be small (microcystic) or large (macrocystic). The disease can affect people of any age and gets worse over time. Symptoms can vary, but all involve problems with the nervous system, such as difficulty thinking and seizures. Additionally problems with movement may present such as difficulty with coordination (pyramidial feature), muscle stiffness (extrapyramidal feature), and difficulty with balance (cerbellum feature)."
"Summary of Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia: Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH) is a non-cancerous tumor that occurs due to the overgrowth of the cells that line the blood vessels. Symptoms of IPEH may include a soft mass under the skin and reddish-blue coloring on the skin. Other symptoms may depend on the location of the IPEH. The most common areas of the body for IPEH to occur are the head, neck, lower limbs, and fingers. The cause is unknown. Diagnosis is made by imaging studies and a biopsy to remove a piece of the tumor for examination by a pathologist."
"Summary of Pleuropulmonary blastoma familial tumor susceptibility syndrome: Pleuropulmonary blastoma familial tumor susceptibility syndrome (DICER1 syndrome) causes a moderately increased risk for certain cancers and tumors. The lungs, kidneys, ovaries, and thyroid are the most commonly involved sites. Pleuropulmonary blastoma is the most commonly associated tumor and often occurs in infants and young children. Cysts in the kidneys (cystic nephroma) are also associated with DICER1 syndrome. These cysts typically develop in childhood, but do not usually cause any health problems. Women with DICER1 syndrome are at an increased risk for Sertoli-Leydig tumors of the ovaries. DICER1 syndrome is also associated with goiter (multiple fluid-filled or solid tumors in the thyroid gland). These goiters typically occur in adulthood and most often do not cause symptoms. This syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the DICER1 gene. It is passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion. Affected members in the same family can be very differently affected."
Summary of Posner-Schlossman syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Primary hyperoxaluria type 3: Primary hyperoxaluria is an autosomal recessive disorder of glyoxylate metabolism that results in excessive endogenous oxalate synthesis and the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones. Progressive renal inflammation and interstitial fibrosis from advanced nephrocalcinosis, recurrent urolithiasis, and urinary tract infections can cause reduced renal function, systemic oxalate deposition, and end-stage renal failure. Compared to hyperoxaluria type I (HP1; 259900) and type II (HP2; 260000), HP3 appears to be the least severe, with good preservation of kidney function in most patients. The typical clinical characteristic is early onset of recurrent urolithiasis, but less active stone formation later (summary by Wang et al., 2015).For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of primary hyperoxaluria, see HP1 (259900)."
"Summary of Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) refers to a group of conditions that affect the nervous system. Signs and symptoms vary widely between the forms but generally include a combination of dementia, vision loss, and epilepsy. All types of NCL also belong to a larger group of diseases known as lysosomal storage disorders."
"Summary of Proximal 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome: 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is a condition caused by a missing piece (deletion) on a specific region of chromosome 16 designated as p11.2. People with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome usually have developmental delay and intellectual disability. Most also have at least some features of autism spectrum disorder. Some affected people have minor physical abnormalities; however, signs and symptoms vary. Some affected people appear to have no physical, intellectual, or behavioral abnormalities. Most cases of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome are not inherited, although affected people can pass the condition on to their children."
"Summary of Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Handigodu type: Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Handigodu type is a rare genetic disorder that affects the bones. It has three different types:
Patients of average height with painful hip joints and no spinal problems.
Short-statured patients with shortening of the trunk, arms longer than their height, and hip problems.
Patients with dwarfism, skeletal abnormalities (especially in the knees and hands), and severe hip, knee, hand, and wrist problems.
Most patients with this condition cannot walk long distances, and many have decreased joint spaces. Imaging tests show that they have sclerotic and cystic changes."
Summary of Persistent genital arousal disorder: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Conjunctival malignant melanoma: A malignant melanoma within the conjunctiva of the eye.
"Summary of Hemochromatosis: Hemochromatosis is a disease in which too much iron builds up in the body. This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. While many organs can be affected, iron overload is especially likely to affect the liver, heart, and pancreas. Early symptoms of Hemochromatosis can include fatigue, weakness, and joint pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, loss of sex drive, liver disease, diabetes, heart problems, and skin discoloration. Hemochromatosis may be hereditary, meaning it is caused by genetic changes (genetic changes or pathogenic variants) to any of several genes including FTH1, HAMP, HFE, HFE2 (also known as HJV), SLC40A1, and TFR2. This is called acquired Hemochromatosis. When Hemochromatosis develops in an infant and the exact cause of the disease cannot be determined, it is called neonatal Hemochromatosis. A diagnosis of Hemochromatosis is suspected when a doctor observes signs and symptoms of the disease. A doctor may decide to order laboratory tests including a liver biopsy, MRI, or blood test. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Lupus nephritis: Lupus nephritis is a kidney disorder that is a complication of systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), commonly known as lupus. The symptoms of Lupus nephritis include blood in the urine, a foamy appearance to the urine, high blood pressure, and swelling in any part of the body."

"Summary of Epidermolysis bullosa simplex: Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily.  Symptoms of EBS range from mild in the Weber-Cockayne type to severe with blistering that is present at birth or after. Milder phenotypes of EBS have blistering confined to the limbs, whereas in the most severe Dowling Meara type, blisters may also form in the mouth. All of the types are typically caused by genetic changes in the KRT5 and KRT14 genes. They are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but autosomal recessive inheritance has occurred in rare cases."
"Summary of Pachyonychia congenita: Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a rare inherited condition that primarily affects the nails and skin. The fingernails and toenails may be thickened and abnormally shaped. Affected people can also develop painful calluses and blisters on the soles of their feet and less frequently on the palms of their hands (palmoplantar keratoderma). Additional features include white patches on the tongue and inside of the mouth (leukokeratosis); bumps around the elbows, knees, and waistline (follicular hyperkeratosis); and cysts of various types including steatocystoma. Features may vary among affected people depending on their specific genetic change. PC is divided into 5 types based on the specific keratin gene involved: PC-K6a, PC-K6b, PC-K6c, PC-K16, and PC-K17. All forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to 16p13.3 microdeletion: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to 16p13.3 microdeletion is a chromosome abnormality that can affect many parts of the body. People with this condition are missing a small piece (deletion) of chromosome 16 at a location designated p13.3. This deletion results in a severe form of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Some researchers believe that it is a unique emerging syndrome. Signs and symptoms may include failure to thrive, hypotonia (reduced muscle tone), short stature, microcephaly (unusually small head), characteristic facial features, mild to moderate intellectual disability, organ anomalies (i.e. heart and/or kidney problems), and vulnerability to infections. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide information about whether the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosome abnormalities. However, sometimes one parent has a balanced translocation where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having a child with a chromosome abnormality like a deletion."
"Summary of 16p13.3 microduplication syndrome: Chromosome 16p13.3 duplication is a chromosome abnormality that can affect many parts of the body. People with this condition have an extra piece of genetic material (duplication) on chromosome 16 at a location designated p13.3. The symptoms and severity vary from person to person because not everyone with a 16p13.3 duplication has the same amount of extra DNA. Possible symptoms include developmental delay, speech delay, joint abnormalities, characteristic facial features, attention deficit, autism spectrum disorders, and underlying health problems such as heart conditions. Most cases are not inherited and occur randomly. Less commonly, the duplication is inherited from a parent. Regardless, a person with the duplication can pass it on to his/her child."
"Summary of Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) is a group of disorders of cartilage and bone development, primarily affecting the ends of the long bones in the arms and legs (epiphyses). There are two types of MED, which are distinguished by their patterns of inheritance - autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive. Recessive MED may also cause malformations of the hands, feet, and knees; scoliosis; or other abnormalities. Most people are diagnosed during childhood, but mild cases may not be diagnosed until adulthood. Dominant MED is caused by genetic changes in the COMP, COL9A1, COL9A2, COL9A3, or MATN3 genes (or can be of unknown cause), and recessive MED is caused by genetic changes in the SLC26A2 gene."
"Summary of Exogenous ochronosis: Exogenous ochronosis (EO) refers to the bluish-black discoloration of areas of the skin, especially the face, ear cartilage, the ocular (eye) tissue, and other body locations. It occurs as the result of exposure to malarial drugs, skin lightening creams and over-exposure the the sun. Other than the skin discoloration, there are no other health effects. EO does not typically appear until adulthood and may be difficult to diagnose. Exogenous ochronosis is different from hereditary ochronosis, which is an inherited condition that occurs with alkaptonuria."
"Summary of Pseudohypoparathyroidism: Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PTH) is a genetic disorder in which the body is unable to respond to parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid hormone helps control calcium, phosphorous, and vitamin D levels in the bones and blood. The symptoms of PTH are caused by low calcium levels and high phosphate levels in the blood. This may cause cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), dental problems, numbness, seizures, or tetany (muscle twitches and hand and foot spasms). Symptoms may also include short stature, obesity, short fingers and toes, and intellectual disability. These symptoms are usually first seen in childhood. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical examination, laboratory tests, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Glycogen storage disease due to muscle and heart glycogen synthase deficiency: Glycogen storage disease type 0 (also known as GSD 0) is a condition caused by the body's inability to form a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. GSD 0 has two types: in muscle GSD 0, glycogen formation in the muscles is impaired, and in liver GSD 0, glycogen formation in the liver is impaired.The signs and symptoms of muscle GSD 0 typically begin in early childhood. Affected individuals often experience muscle pain and weakness or episodes of fainting (syncope) following moderate physical activity, such as walking up stairs. The loss of consciousness that occurs with fainting typically lasts up to several hours. Some individuals with muscle GSD 0 have a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia) known as long QT syndrome. In all affected individuals, muscle GSD 0 impairs the heart's ability to effectively pump blood and increases the risk of cardiac arrest and sudden death, particularly after physical activity. Sudden death from cardiac arrest can occur in childhood or adolescence in people with muscle GSD 0.Individuals with liver GSD 0 usually show signs and symptoms of the disorder in infancy. People with this disorder develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) after going long periods of time without food (fasting). Signs of hypoglycemia become apparent when affected infants begin sleeping through the night and stop late-night feedings; these infants exhibit extreme tiredness (lethargy), pale skin (pallor), and nausea. During episodes of fasting, ketone levels in the blood may increase (ketosis). Ketones are molecules produced during the breakdown of fats, which occurs when stored sugars (such as glycogen) are unavailable. These short-term signs and symptoms of liver GSD 0 often improve when food is eaten and sugar levels in the body return to normal. The features of liver GSD 0 vary; they can be mild and go unnoticed for years, or they can include developmental delay and growth failure."
"Summary of 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria: 2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria is a condition that causes progressive damage to the brain. The major types of this disorder are called D-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA), L-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-HGA), and combined D,L-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D,L-2-HGA). The main features of D-2-HGA vary within the different types but, in general, may include delayed development; seizures; weak muscle tone (hypotonia); and abnormalities in the largest part of the brain (the cerebrum), which controls many important functions such as muscle movement, speech, vision, thinking, emotion, and memory."
"Summary of Hereditary arterial and articular multiple calcification syndrome: Hereditary arterial and articular multiple calcification syndrome (also known as arterial calcification due to deficiency of CD73, or ACDC), is a rare, adult-onset vascular disorder. People with ACDC have calcium build-up in the large vessels (mainly below the waist) and in the joints of the hands and feet. Signs and symptoms may include progressive pain and cramping in the calves, thighs, buttocks, feet, and/or hands. ACDC is caused by genetic changes in the NT5E gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Hypermethioninemia due to glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency: Hypermethioninemia due to glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency (GNMT deficiency) is a very rare condition characterized by persistent and isolated excess levels of methionine in the blood (hypermethioninemia). The only clinical abnormalities are mild increase of the liver size (hepatomegaly) and chronic elevation of the transaminase levels in the blood without liver disease. Methionine may also be increased in urine. However, because elevated levels of methionine in the blood itself is a risk factor for development of neurological signs and symptoms, people with hypermethioninemia due to glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency can have neurological problems when methionine levels are greater than 800 Î¼mol/L. GNMT deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the GNMT gene. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
Summary of Chromosome 9 inversion: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Congenital factor XIII deficiency: Congenital factor XIII deficiency is an extremely rare inherited blood disorder characterized by abnormal blood clotting that may result in abnormal bleeding. Signs and symptoms occur as the result of a deficiency in the blood clotting factor 13, which is responsible for stabilizing the formation of a blood clot. In affected individuals, the blood fails to clot appropriately, resulting in poor wound healing. Blood may seep into surrounding soft tissues, resulting in local pain and swelling. Internal bleeding may occur; about 25 percent of affected individuals experience bleeding in the brain. Congenital factor XIII deficiency is usually caused by genetic changes in the F13A1 gene, but genetic changes have also been found in the F13B gene. It is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Acquired forms have also been reported in association with liver failure, inflammatory bowel disease, and myeloid leukemia."
"Summary of MOGS-CDG: MOGS-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation characterized by generalized hypotonia, craniofacial dysmorphism (prominent occiput, short palpebral fissures, long eyelashes, broad nose, high arched palate , retrognathia), hypoplastic genitalia, seizures, feeding difficulties, hypoventilation, severe hypogammaglobulinemia with generalized edema, and increased resistance to particular viral infections (particularly to enveloped viruses). The disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene  MOGS  (2p13.1)."
"Summary of Familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine: Familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine refers to a rare type of migraine with aura that occurs with motor weakness during the aura. The two types of hemiplegic migraine (HM) are distinguished based on the family history: familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM, in which at least one other family member has the condition) and sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM, in which there is no family history). Signs and symptoms vary but may include visual disturbances, sensory loss, difficulty with speech, weakness on one side of the body, confusion, and impaired consciousness. Severe attacks may occur in both types with prolonged hemiplegia, coma, fever and/or seizures. FHM may be caused by a genetic change in any of several genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Laing early-onset distal myopathy: Laing distal myopathy is a slowly progressive muscle disorder that tends to begin in childhood. Early symptoms include weakness in the feet and ankles, followed by weakness in the hands and wrists. Weakness in the feet leads to tightening of the Achilles tendon, an inability to lift the big toe, and a high-stepping walk. Weakness in the hands makes it more difficult to lift the fingers, especially the third and fourth fingers. Other findings include scoliosis and cardiomyopathy in up to one third of individuals. Most affected people remain mobile throughout life. Laing distal myopathy is caused by genetic changes in the MYH7 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion."
"Summary of Homocystinuria: Homocystinuria refers to a group of inherited disorders in which the body is unable to process certain building blocks of proteins (amino acids) properly. This leads to increased amounts of homocysteine and other amnio acids in the blood and urine. The most common type of genetic Homocystinuria, called CBS deficiency, is caused by the lack of an enzyme known as cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Most states in the United States test for Homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency at birth by newborn screening. Other types are less common, and are caused by different missing or non-working enzymes. Homocystinuria can affect the eyes, skeleton, central nervous system and the blood clotting system. Genetic changes in the MTHFR, MTR, MTRR and MMADHC genes can cause Homocystinuria. All these forms of Homocystinuria are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Kallmann syndrome: Kallmann syndrome (KS) is a condition that causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and an impaired sense of smell. HH affects the production of the hormones needed for sexual development. It is present from birth and is due to deficiency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). KS is often diagnosed at puberty due to lack of sexual development. It may first be suspected in infancy in males with undescended testicles or a small penis. Symptoms in untreated, adult males may include decreased bone density and muscle mass; small testicles; erectile dysfunction; low sex drive; and infertility. Untreated adult females with KS usually do not have menstrual periods (amenorrhea) and normal, little, or no breast development. Most cases of KS are sporadic (not inherited) but some cases are inherited. The mode of inheritance depends on the gene involved."
"Summary of Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 4 with or without anosmia: Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (IGD) is characterized by inappropriately low serum concentrations of the gonadotropins LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) in the presence of low circulating concentrations of sex steroids. IGD is associated with a normal sense of smell (normosmic IGD) in approximately 40% of affected individuals and an impaired sense of smell (Kallmann syndrome) in approximately 60%. IGD can first become apparent in infancy, adolescence, or adulthood. Infant boys with congenital IGD often have micropenis and cryptorchidism. Adolescents and adults with IGD have clinical evidence of hypogonadism and incomplete sexual maturation on physical examination. Adult males with IGD tend to have prepubertal testicular volume (i.e., <4 mL), absence of secondary sexual features (e.g., facial and axillary hair growth, deepening of the voice), decreased muscle mass, diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. Adult females have little or no breast development and primary amenorrhea. Although skeletal maturation is delayed, the rate of linear growth is usually normal except for the absence of a distinct pubertal growth spurt."
"Summary of Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 5 with or without anosmia: Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (IGD) is characterized by inappropriately low serum concentrations of the gonadotropins LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) in the presence of low circulating concentrations of sex steroids. IGD is associated with a normal sense of smell (normosmic IGD) in approximately 40% of affected individuals and an impaired sense of smell (Kallmann syndrome) in approximately 60%. IGD can first become apparent in infancy, adolescence, or adulthood. Infant boys with congenital IGD often have micropenis and cryptorchidism. Adolescents and adults with IGD have clinical evidence of hypogonadism and incomplete sexual maturation on physical examination. Adult males with IGD tend to have prepubertal testicular volume (i.e., <4 mL), absence of secondary sexual features (e.g., facial and axillary hair growth, deepening of the voice), decreased muscle mass, diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. Adult females have little or no breast development and primary amenorrhea. Although skeletal maturation is delayed, the rate of linear growth is usually normal except for the absence of a distinct pubertal growth spurt."
"Summary of Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 6 with or without anosmia: Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (IGD) is characterized by inappropriately low serum concentrations of the gonadotropins LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) in the presence of low circulating concentrations of sex steroids.

Adult females have little or no breast development and primary amenorrhea. Although skeletal maturation is delayed, the rate of linear growth is usually normal except for the absence of a distinct pubertal growth spurt."
"Summary of Syndromic multisystem autoimmune disease due to Itch deficiency: Syndromic multisystem autoimmune disease due to Itch deficiency is a rare, genetic, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by failure to thrive, global developmental delay, distinctive craniofacial dysmorphism (relative macrocephaly, dolichocephaly, frontal bossing, orbital proptosis, flattened midface with a prominent occiput, low, posteriorly rotated ears, micrognatia), hepato- and/or splenomegaly, and multisystemic autoimmune disease involving the lungs, liver, gut and/or thyroid gland."
Summary of Benign metastasizing leiomyoma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Peritoneal cystic mesothelioma: Peritoneal cystic mesothelioma (BMPM) is a very rare benign cystic tumor arising from the peritoneal mesothelium (lining of the abdominal wall). It commonly occurs in young to middle-aged women who have a prior history of abdominal surgery, endometriosis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. The first symptoms usually include abdominal or pelvic pain, tenderness, and rarely, constipation and/or urinary hesitancy. Since it was first described in 1979, there have been approximately 130 cases described in the medical literature. Peritoneal cystic mesothelioma is not related to prior asbestos exposure. The specific cause is unknown."
"Summary of Recurrent infection due to specific granule deficiency: A rare functional neutrophil defect characterized by infantile onset of increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections, especially of the skin, ears, lung, and lymph nodes, with neutrophils lacking specific granules and exhibiting bilobed nuclei on peripheral blood smear. Bone marrow biopsy shows hypercellularity, paucity of neutrophil granulocytes, and progressive myelodysplasia. Additional manifestations may include mild to moderate developmental delay, mild facial dysmorphic features (such as dysplastic ears), and anomalies of bones, teeth, and nails."
"Summary of CLIPPERS: Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids (CLIPPERS) is a treatable inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. Specifically, it is a type of encephalomyelitis, which is a general term describing inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. CLIPPERS predominantly affects the cerebellum, spinal cord, and brainstem - the part of the brain that directly connects to the spinal cord. Symptoms usually develop over weeks or months, and only rarely over days. The most common symptoms of CLIPPERS include uncoordinated walking (gait ataxia), double vision (diplopia), difficulty speaking (dysarthria), cognitive impairment, and abnormal facial sensations (such as numbness or tingling). Other symptoms may include pseudobulbar affect, ringing in the ears (tinnitis), shaking muscles (tremor), uncontrolled eye movements (nystagmus), distortion of taste, nausea, or paraparesis (partial loss of function of the legs). The underlying cause of CLIPPERS currently is unclear. There is no one laboratory or imaging test that confirms the diagnosis, but various laboratory and imaging tests may be needed to support the diagnosis, and to confirm or rule out many other conditions that cause overlapping symptoms. A brain MRI with contrast typically has characteristic findings. An important part of the ultimate diagnosis, and a classic feature of CLIPPERS, is that symptoms and MRI findings markedly improve with corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids may first be taken intravenously (by IV) for several days, and then orally. Most people with CLIPPERS recover significantly within weeks of starting corticosteroids."
"Summary of Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia: Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) is a rare and poorly understood lung condition that is characterized by the abnormal overgrowth of certain cells in the lung (called pulmonary neuroendocrine cells) that receive signals from nerve cells (neurons) and produce hormones. People with this diagnosis may have no obvious symptoms or may exhibit features of airway disease such as a chronic, nonproductive cough, shortness of breath with exertion, and wheezing. It is considered to be a precancerous condition as studies suggest it is a precursor for pulmonary carcinoid tumors. The cause of DIPNECH is currently unknown."
"Summary of Goldmann-Favre syndrome: Goldmann-Favre syndrome, also known as the severe form of enhanced S-cone syndrome, is a inherited eye disease that affects the light-sensitive part of the eye (retina). Within the retina are ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" cones which allow us to see colors properly; and rods which allows us to see in dim light. People with Goldmann-Favre syndrome are born with an overabundance of blue cones, a reduced number of red and green cones, and few, if any, functional rods. As a result they experience an increased sensitivity to blue light, varying degrees of red and green cone vision, night blindness occurring from early life, vision loss, and retinal degeneration. Goldmann-Favre syndrome can be caused by genetic changes in the NR2E3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Stickler syndrome: Stickler syndrome is a group of hereditary connective tissue disorders characterized by distinctive facial features, eye abnormalities, hearing loss, and joint problems. The symptoms of Stickler syndrome may vary but include near-sightedness (myopia), retinal detachment, underdevelopment of the middle of the face, and the development of arthritis at a young age. Stickler syndrome is caused by genetic changes (genetic changes or pathogenic variants) in one of six genes: COL2A1, COL11A1, COL11A2, COL9A1, COL9A2, or COL9A3. The syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. Stickler syndrome can be diagnosed when a doctor observes many symptoms consistent with the syndrome. Genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis."
Summary of Bilateral frontal polymicrogyria: Bilateral frontal polymicrogyria is one of the rarest subtypes of polymicrogyria. It is a symmetric and bilateral form (in both brain hemispheres) that only involves the frontal lobes without including the area located behind the Sylvius fissure or the area located behind the Rolando sulcus. Signs and symptoms included delayed motor and language milestones; spastic (stiffness) hemiparesis (weakness in one side of the body) or quadriparesis (weakness in all four limbs of the body); and mild to moderate intellectual disability. Seizures may also be present. The frontoparietal form is caused by changes in the GPR56 gene but the cause for the frontal form of polymicrogyira is still not known.
"Summary of Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria: Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP) is a rare neurological disorder that affects the cerebral cortex (the outer surface of the brain). BFPP specifically affects the frontal and parietal lobes on both sides of the brain (bilateral). Signs and symptoms typically include moderate to severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, cerebellar ataxia, strabismus, and dysconjugate gaze (eyes that are not aligned). Some cases are caused by genetic changes in the GPR56 gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Bilateral parasagittal parieto-occipital polymicrogyria: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Bilateral generalized polymicrogyria: Bilateral generalized polymicrogyria is a rare neurological disorder that affects the cerebral cortex (the outer surface of the brain). This is the most widespread form of polymicrogyria and typically affects the entire surface of the brain. Signs and symptoms include severe intellectual disability, problems with movement, and seizures that are difficult to treat. While the exact cause of Bilateral generalized polymicrogyria is not fully understood, it is thought to be due to improper brain development during embryonic growth. Most cases appear to follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."
Summary of Spina bifida occulta: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Loeys-Dietz syndrome: Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that causes aortic aneurysms, widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), cleft palate and/or split uvula (the little piece of flesh that hangs down in the back of the mouth) and twisting or spiraled arteries (arterial tortuosity). Other findings include craniosynostosis, extropia (eyes that turn outward), micrognathia, structural brain abnormalities, intellectual deficit, and congenital heart disease. Signs and symptoms vary among individuals. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with variable clinical expression. This condition is called Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 1 when affected individuals have cleft palate, craniosynostosis, and/or hypertelorism. Individuals without these features are said to have Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 2. The disease is caused by genetic changes in the TGFBR1, the TGFBR2, the SMAD3 or the TGFB2 genes."
"Summary of Cone rod dystrophy: Cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) is a group of inherited eye disorders that affect the light sensitive cells of the retina called the cones and rods. People with this condition experience vision loss over time as the cones and rods deteriorate. Initial signs and symptoms that usually occur in childhood may include decreased sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia). These signs are usually followed by blind spots in the central field of vision (scotomas), loss of color perception, and loss of peripheral vision. Most individuals with this condition are legally blind by mid adulthood. There are over 30 types of CRD caused by genetic changes in several different genes that can be inherited in many different ways including autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked or mitochondrial patterns. CRDs are usually non-syndromic, but they may also be part of several syndromes."
"Summary of Logopenic progressive aphasia: Logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) is a type of dementia characterized by language disturbance, including difficulty making or understanding speech (aphasia). It is a type of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Affected individuals have slow, hesitant speech due to difficulty retrieving the correct words, names, or numbers. Difficulty with phase and sentence repetition are additionally present. Speech is typically well articulated and grammatically correct with good single-word comprehension. But over time, affected individuals may have trouble understanding long or complex verbal information, due to problems holding onto lengthy information that they hear. Language difficulties associated with LPA are due to shrinking, or atrophy, in the left posterior temporal cortex and inferior parietal lobule."
"Summary of Semantic dementia: Semantic dementia (SD) is a form of frontotemporal dementia (FTD; see this term), characterized by the progressive, amodal and profound loss of semantic knowledge (combination of visual associative agnosia, anomia, surface dyslexia or dysgraphia and disrupted comprehension of word meaning) and behavioral abnormalities, attributable to the degeneration of the anterior temporal lobes."
"Summary of Progressive non-fluent aphasia: Progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) is a form of frontotemporal dementia (FTD; see this term), characterized by agrammatism, laborious speech, alexia, and agraphia, frequently accompanied by apraxia of speech (AOS). Language comprehension is relatively preserved."
Summary of Paroxysmal hemicrania: A rare primary headache disorder characterized by multiple attacks of unilateral pain that occur in association with ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. The hallmarks of this syndrome are the relative shortness of the attacks and the complete response to indomethacin therapy.
"Summary of Hemicrania continua: Hemicrania continua (HC) is a type of primary headache disorder, which means the headache is not caused by another medical condition. Symptoms of HC include constant mild to moderate pain on one side of the head (unilateral) with periods of more intense, severe, migraine-like pain (exacerbations). These severe pain periods can last from 20 minutes to days. The frequency of exacerbations also varies greatly. The headache stays on the same side of the head and usually without pain free periods. HC is more common in women and most often starts in adulthood. Diagnosis of Hemicrania continua (HC) is made by ruling out other possible causes of the pain and by clinical symptoms. During the periods of severe pain, at least one of the following symptoms must be present on same side of the body as the headache: watering or red eyes (conjunctival injection), congested or runny nose, or drooping eyelid. The cause of HC is unknown."
"Summary of Hypnic headache: A rare headache characterized by recurrent brief, intense headache attacks occurring exclusively during sleep, typically at the same time of the night, causing the patient to wake up. The pain usually lasts more than 15 minutes after waking. It is mostly bilateral and may be associated with nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia, while characteristically no autonomic symptoms are present."

Summary of Exertional headache: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease: Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is a group of genetic kidney diseases that cause progressive loss of kidney function. Signs and symptoms of all forms of ADTKD include slowly worsening kidney disease. Urine exams of people with ADTKD show a bland urinary sediment (little blood or little or no protein). Kidney ultrasound examination is generally normal early in the disease course, but some people with ADTKD have cysts in the center of the kidneys (medullary cysts) that may be seen on an ultrasound. Inheritance of ADTKD is autosomal dominant, as the name implies. Most people with ADTKD have a family history of ""kidney disease"" (if not a family history of ADTKD specifically) or some of the other symptoms. The diagnosis of ADTKD may be suspected based on family history, symptoms, and laboratory tests, and it can be confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Intravenous leiomyomatosis: Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) is a benign smooth muscle tumor of the uterus that grows within the veins but does not invade the surrounding tissue. IVL usually starts in the veins of the uterus and can extend into the inferior vena cava and ultimately into the right side of the heart, resulting in death The abnormal smooth muscle cells that cause IVL express estrogen and progesterone receptors and tumor growth thus appears to respond to these hormones. Although this is a benign condition, many affected individuals require surgery to remove the excess tissue in the uterus and heart. The exact cause of IVL remains unknown. IVL is rare, with only about 200 cases reported in the medical literature."
"Summary of Lamellar ichthyosis: Lamellar ichthyosis is a rare genetic condition that affects the skin. Infants affected by Lamellar ichthyosis are generally born with a shiny, waxy layer of skin (called a collodian membrane) that is typically shed within the first two weeks of life. The skin beneath the collodian membrane is red and scaly. Other signs and symptoms of the condition may include ectropion, lips that turn outwards, hair loss, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis (thick skin on the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet), nail abnormalities, dehydration and respiratory problems. Although the condition may be caused by changes in one of several different genes, approximately 90% of cases are caused by genetic changes in the TGM1 gene. Lamellar ichthyosis is generally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast: Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer. The tumor cells differ in type from that of the typical ductal or lobular breast cancers. The cells look like skin cells or cells that make bone. Some women experience no early signs or symptoms, while others experience general symptoms of breast cancers, such as new breast lumps."
"Summary of MUTYH-related attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis: MUTYH-related attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (also known as MYH-associated polyposis) is an inherited condition characterized by the development of multiple adenomatous colon polyps and an increased risk of colorectal cancer. This condition, a milder form of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), is sometimes called autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis because it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. People with this condition have fewer polyps than those with the classic type of FAP; fewer than 100 polyps typically develop, rather than hundreds or thousands. They may also be at increased risk for upper gastrointestinal polyps. MUTYH-related attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by genetic changes in the MYH gene."
"Summary of Female restricted epilepsy with intellectual disability: Female restricted epilepsy with intellectual disability is a rare X-linked epilepsy syndrome characterized by febrile or afebrile seizures (mainly tonic-clonic, but also absence, myoclonic, and atonic) starting in the first years of life and, in most cases, developmental delay and intellectual disability of variable severity. Behavioral disturbances (e.g. autistic features, hyperactivity, and aggressiveness) are also frequently associated. This disease affects exclusively females, with male carriers being unaffected, despite an X-linked inheritance."
Summary of Infantile scoliosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Insulin autoimmune syndrome: Insulin autoimmune syndrome is a rare condition that causes low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This occurs because the body begins to make a specific kind of protein called antibodies to attack insulin. Insulin is a naturally occurring hormone that is responsible for keeping blood sugar at a normal level. When blood sugar levels get too high, insulin helps to store the sugar for future use. People affected by Insulin autoimmune syndrome have antibodies that attack insulin, causing it to work too hard and the level of blood sugar to become too low. Insulin autoimmune syndrome most often begins during adulthood."
"Summary of Postorgasmic illness syndrome: Postorgasmic illness syndrome (POIS) is a rare condition in which a person develops flu-like and allergy symptoms after orgasm, whether with a partner, through masturbation, or spontaneously during sleep. POIS typically is reported in males (after ejaculation), but females have rarely been reported to have symptoms of POIS. Symptoms may develop within seconds, minutes, or hours after orgasm, and usually last for 2 to 7 days before going away on their own. Possible symptoms vary from person to person, but more common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, headache, fever, mood changes, memory or concentration problems, stuffy nose, sore throat, and itching eyes. The underlying cause of POIS is not known. Some scientists believe that in men, it is an autoimmune or allergic disorder that causes an inflammatory reaction to a substance in a man's own semen. Others have proposed POIS may be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. POIS can cause severe distress in people with the condition and their partners. Some people with POIS abstain from sexual activity or find that they need to schedule sex for a time when they can cope with the symptoms."
"Summary of Fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration: Fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration (FAHN) is a very rare, autosomal recessive form of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) characterized by childhood-onset focal dystonia, progressive spastic paraplegia that progresses to tetra paresis, ataxia, dysarthria, intellectual decline, and oculomotor disturbances (optic atrophy), accompanied by iron deposition in the globus pallidus."
"Summary of Chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated tempera: Chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature syndrome (CANDLE syndrome) occurs when the immune system attacks the body by mistake. Symptoms usually develop within the first few months of life and may include recurrent fevers and purple colored spots on the skin particularly around the eyes. Loss of body fat, bone, and joint pain also usually occur. Since so few people have been reported with CANDLE syndrome, it is difficult to know how it affects people in the long term. CANDLE syndrome occurs when the PSMB8 gene is not working correctly. Other genes associated with CANDLE syndrome include PSMB4, PSMA3, and POMP. It is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern; however, when associated with variants in the POMP gene, may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
"Summary of Patulous Eustachian Tube: Patulous Eustachian Tube is a benign but symptomatically troubling condition in which the eustachian tube stays open most of the time. The eustachian tube is the tube that runs between the middle ear and throat and regulates the ear pressure around the ear drum. Under normal circumstances, it remains closed most of the time, opening only on occasion to equalize air pressure between the middle ear and the exterior environment. Major symptoms include distorted autophony (hearing one's own voice or breathing), echoing which may interfere with speech production, wave-like sounds, and a sensation of fullness in the ear. In severe cases, vertigo and hearing loss may occur. Over time, individuals with Patulous Eustachian Tube may develop serious and even extreme responses to the abnormal sounds and other findings. In most cases, the cause of Patulous Eustachian Tube is unknown. Weight loss and pregnancy may be predisposing factors. Neurologic disorders that cause muscle atrophy such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and motor neuron disease have been implicated in some cases of Patulous Eustachian Tube. Other cases may be associated with medications such as oral contraceptives or diuretics. Other predisposing factors include fatigue, stress, anxiety, exercise, and temporomandibular joint syndrome."
"Summary of 1q21.1 microdeletion syndrome: 1q21.1 microdeletion syndrome is a chromosome abnormality where a segment of genetic material on the long arm (or q arm) of chromosome 1 at position 21.1 is missing (or deleted). Some people with this deletion have no observable features while others have variable findings that can include a small head (microcephaly), developmental delay (speech and motor delays), mild intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and eye abnormalities. Other findings can include seizures as well as abnormalities of the heart, skeleton, and urinary system. Psychiatric and behavioral features can include autism spectrum disorders, anxiety and mood disorders, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and sleep disorders. This syndrome is caused by a deletion in a specific region of 1q21.1, which is distinct from the deletion region that causes TAR syndrome."
Summary of Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a rare neurological disease characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis and hypokalemia during a thyrotoxic state.
"Summary of Prothrombin-related thrombophilia: Prothrombin-related thrombophilia affects the way the blood clots. Individuals who have a thrombophilia have an increased risk to form abnormal blood clots in blood vessels. Symptoms of Prothrombin-related thrombophilia include a higher than average risk to develop blood clots in the deep veins of the legs (deep venous thrombosis) and blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism). Many people with Prothrombin-related thrombophilia never develop abnormal blood clots. This condition is caused by a particular genetic variant (written G20210A or 20210G>A) in the F2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Prothrombin-related thrombophilia is diagnosed based on the symptoms, physical exam, blood tests, and imaging studies. The diagnosis may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Lichen planus pigmentosus: Lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) is a rare form of lichen planus. It is characterized by oval or irregularly-shaped brown to gray-brown macules and patches on the skin. Areas that are exposed to sun such as the forehead, temples and neck are most commonly affected. However, the macules and patches may also develop on the trunk or in places where two areas of skin touch or rub together (i.e. the armpit, groin, etc). The cause of LPP is unknown, but studies suggest it may be triggered by UV light, viral infections, or agents applied to the skin such as mustard oil and amla oil."
"Summary of Autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia type 31: A rare type of hereditary spastic paraplegia usually characterized by a pure phenotype of proximal weakness of the lower extremities with spastic gait and brisk reflexes, with a bimodal age of onset of either childhood or adulthood (>30 years). In some cases, it can present as a complex phenotype with additional associated manifestations including peripheral neuropathy, bulbar palsy (with dysarthria and dysphagia), distal amyotrophy, and impaired distal vibration sense."
"Summary of Combined malonic and methylmalonic acidemia: Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) is an inherited condition in which certain chemicals accumulate in the blood and urine of affected individuals. People with CMAMMA can have a wide variety of symptoms. Children with CMAMMA can suffer from developmental delays and a failure to gain weight and grow (failure to thrive). In those who were identified as adults, symptoms may include psychiatric features and neurological problems that can mimic Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Genetic changes in the ACSF3 gene cause CMAMMA."
Summary of Sickle delta beta thalassemia: This section is currently in development.
Summary of California encephalitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Eastern equine encephalitis: Eastern equine encephalitis (Triple E) is an illness caused by a virus that comes from an infected mosquito bite. Most people who are infected have no symptoms, but some may develop fever, headaches, and vomiting. Symptoms occur within 4-10 days of being infected and most recover in 1-2 weeks. A small number will develop swelling of the brain and severe neurological symptoms that can be permanent. Triple E can also lead to coma and death. This condition is caused by a type of arbovirus and is transmitted by a mosquito which has bitten an infected bird or reptile. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, specific findings in the blood, and occasionally by an MRI of the brain."
"Summary of Idiopathic spontaneous coronary artery dissection: Idiopathic spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a condition in which blood accumulates between the layers of tissue that make up the wall of the coronary artery (the vessel that supplies blood to the heart). The trapped blood then creates a blockage which interferes with blood flow to the heart. Depending on the degree of blockage, symptoms can range from chest pain to heart attack or cardiac arrest. For some, the first symptom is a heart attack. If the blockage is partial, symptoms may include shortness of breath, a rapid heartbeat, sweating, nausea, and fatigue (tiredness). Idiopathic spontaneous coronary artery dissection is more common in women. Idiopathic spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an urgent situation and requires immediate attention. Though the exact cause is not fully understood, risk factors include pregnancy, recently giving birth, very high blood pressure, and extreme exercise. Certain conditions such as connective tissue disorders or fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) may also increase a person's risk of developing Idiopathic spontaneous coronary artery dissection."
"Summary of Obesity due to pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency: Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency is characterized by severe obesity that begins at an early age. Affected infants are usually a normal weight at birth, but they are constantly hungry, which leads to excessive feeding and weight gain during the first year and throughout life. In addition, people with this condition have low levels of a hormone known as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) which leads to adrenal insufficiency. They also tend to have red hair and pale skin. POMC deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the POMC gene. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
Summary of Cushing syndrome due to macronodular adrenal hyperplasia: A rare cause of Cushing syndrome (CS) characterized by nodular enlargement of both adrenal glands (multiple nodules above 1 cm in diameter) that produce excess cortisol and features of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) independent CS.
"Summary of Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia: Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is the most common type of primary scarring alopecia affecting women of African ancestry, with an estimated prevalence of 2.7 to 5.6%. It may be triggered by hair-grooming habits; however, familial occurrence has been reported. Mean age at presentation is 36 years. The first sign is often unexplained hair breakage, followed by hair thinning, primarily involving the vertex scalp and progressing centrifugally. Histopathologic examination shows varying degrees of lymphocytic inflammation, follicular degeneration, and fibrosis (Malki et al., 2019)."
"Summary of KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome: A syndrome caused by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. It manifests with fever, weight loss, and fluid retention in the legs or abdomen. Patients are at risk of developing KSHV-related cancers including Kaposi sarcoma and lymphoma."
"Summary of Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is an inherited disorder that causes abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) and low to moderate levels of calcium in urine (hypocalciuric). People with FHH usually do not have any symptoms and are often diagnosed by chance during routine bloodwork. Weakness, fatigue, issues with concentration, and excessive thirst (polydipsia) have been reported by some people with FHH. Rarely, people with this disorder experience inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) or a buildup of calcium in the joints (chondrocalcinosis). FHH is mainly classified into three different types depending on the genetic cause. FHH type 1 is the most common type of FHH and is caused by changes (also known as pathogenic variantss) in the CASR gene. The protein made from the CaSR gene, the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR protein), monitors and regulates the level of calcium in the blood. FHH type 2 is caused by changes in the GNA11 gene, and FHH type 3 is caused by changes in the AP2S1 gene. All three types of FHH are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In rare cases, FHH may be caused when a person's immune system mistakenly makes antibodies that attack the CaSR protein. The autoimmune form of FHH is not known to be caused by changes in a specific gene. Diagnosis of FHH is suspected by high levels of calcium in the blood, especially when there are no other symptoms present. Further blood and urine tests may be used to rule out other possible causes. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis of FHH, except in rare autoimmune cases."
"Summary of Hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome: Hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT) is an inherited condition that causes overactivity of the parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism). These glands regulate the body's use of calcium, so overactivity can lead to high calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia). The syndrome typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood. The hyperparathyroidism in people with HPT-JT is usually caused by a benign tumor in the parathyroid gland called a parathyroid adenoma. In some people with HPT-JT, it is caused by a cancerous (malignant) tumor called a parathyroid carcinoma. Signs and symptoms of hyperparathyroidism may include kidney stones, reduced bone mass, fatigue, muscle weakness, bone or joint pain, and constipation. Some people with HPT-JT also develop a benign tumor in the jaw called an ossifying fibroma. These tumors can grow quickly if not treated. Other features of HPT-JT may include kidney growths such as cysts, hamartomas, or rarely, Wilms tumor. Women with HPT-JT may develop benign or malignant tumors in the uterus. HPT-JT is caused by genetic changes in the CDC73 gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant. The diagnosis is based on the presence of signs and symptoms (identified with blood tests for hyperparathyroidism and imaging studies for tumors) and genetic testing."
Summary of Nevus of Ito: Nevus of Ito is a colored birth mark that is usually slate-brown or blue/gray. It is an unusual birthmark in which the melanocytes (pigment cells) are found deeper than normal in the skin. This type of birthmark is usually located on the shoulder and upper arm area on one side of the body. It can sometimes be associated with sensory changes in the involved skin area. Very rarely does Nevus of Ito become cancerous. The exact cause is unknown. They are most commonly found in Asian populations and appear more frequently in females. They are very uncommon in Caucasians.
"Summary of 1q duplications: Chromosome 1q duplications are chromosome abnormalies that occurs when there is an extra copy of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 1. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that may occur in people with chromosome 1q duplications include developmental delay and learning disabilities, slow growth and/or short stature, various birth defects (such as cleft palate or heart defect) and specific facial features (such as a small, receding jaw). Most cases are not inherited from a parent, but a person with the duplication can pass it on to his/her children."

"Summary of Ring chromosome 2 syndrome: Ring chromosome 2 is a very rare chromosome abnormality in which the ends of chromosome 2 join together to form a ring shape. The severity and symptoms associated with Ring chromosome 2 vary from person to person. Slow growth, short stature and a small head size are common features, but people with Ring chromosome 2 may otherwise be generally healthy with no major birth defects. Signs and symptoms present in some people may include failure to thrive, developmental delay, low muscle tone (hypotonia), distinctive facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and/or other birth defects involving the heart, genitals, or other parts of the body. Ring chromosome 2 typically is not inherited and occurs sporadically, during the formation of egg or sperm cells or shortly after the egg and sperm join together."

The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with monosomy 21 include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children."
Summary of Chromosome 22q duplication: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Monosomy 18q: Monosomy 18q (Distal chromosome 18q deletion syndrome) is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing (deleted) copy of genetic material at the end of the long arm (q) of chromosome 18. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Monosomy 18q include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation, where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a deletion."
"Summary of Proximal chromosome 18q deletion syndrome: Proximal chromosome 18q deletion syndrome is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing (deleted) copy of genetic material from the part of the long (q) arm near the center of chromosome 18. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with Proximal chromosome 18q deletion syndrome include developmental delay, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features. The might also have seizures, low muscle tone (hypotonia), speech and language delays, obesity, and short stature. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation, where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having a child with a chromosomal anomaly like a deletion."

"Summary of Free sialic acid storage disease: Free sialic acid storage diseases are inherited conditions that lead to progressive neurological damage. There are three forms of Free sialic acid storage diseases; an infantile form, an intermediate severe form and Salla disease. The infantile form is the most severe, with symptoms appearing before birth or soon after. Salla disease is the least severe with symptoms that start in the first year of life and progress slowly through adulthood. The intermediate severe form is less severe than the infantile form, but more severe than Salla disease. General symptoms of Free sialic acid storage diseases include developmental delay, low muscle tone, abnormal movements, and seizures. They are progressive, and symptoms get worse over time. All forms of Free sialic acid storage disease are caused by genetic changes in the SLC17A5 gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Free sialic acid storage disease can be diagnosed by laboratory tests looking for sialic acid in the urine, imaging studies of the brain, and genetic testing."
"Summary of Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor: A Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a tumor that develops in the protective lining that covers nerves. The first symptom of MPNST is often a lump or mass that increases in size, sometimes causing pain or a tingling sensation. MPNST is considered an aggressive tumor because there is up to a 65% chance of the tumor regrowing after surgery (a recurrence), and approximately 40% chance of spreading to distant parts of the body (a metastasis), most commonly to the lung. Approximately 25-50% of MPNSTs are associated with a genetic condition known as neurofibromatosis type 1."
"Summary of Heterotaxia: Heterotaxy is a condition characterized by internal organs that are not arranged as would be expected in the chest and abdomen. Organs are expected to be in a particular orientation inside of the body, known as situs solitus. Heterotaxy occurs when the organs are not in this typical orientation, but are instead in different positions in the body. This most commonly causes complications with the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and intestines. Specific symptoms include not getting enough oxygen throughout the body, breathing difficulties, increased risk for infection, and problems digesting food. Heterotaxy may be caused by genetic changes , exposures to toxins while a woman is pregnant causing the baby to have Heterotaxy, or the condition may occur sporadically. The condition is typically diagnosed through imaging such as an echocardiogram or an MRI."
"Summary of Congenital radioulnar synostosis: Congenital radioulnar synostosis is a rare condition in which there is an abnormal connection (synostosis) of the radius and ulna (bones in the forearm) at birth. The condition is present in both arms (bilateral) in approximately 60% of cases. Signs and symptoms depend on the severity of the abnormality and whether it is bilateral; people with the condition often have limited rotational movement of the forearm. Pain is usually not present until the teenage years. There are 2 types of radioulnar synostosis: type 1 and type 2. In type 1, the fusion involves 2-6 cm of the area between the radius and ulna bones which is closer to the elbow and the knobby end of the radius that meets the elbow is absent (radial head). In type 2, the fusion is farther from the elbow and there is dislocation of the radial head. Both types result in a limitation of inward roll (pronation) and outward roll (supination) of the forearm, and in type 2 there is also a restriction of extension at the elbow. Congenital radioulnar synostosis is due to abnormal fetal development of the forearm bones, but the underlying cause is not always known. It is sometimes a feature of certain chromosome abnormalities or genetic syndromes. Some cases appear to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Familial tumoral calcinosis: Tumoral calcinosis is a phosphocalcic metabolism anomaly, particularly among younger age groups and characterized by the presence of calcified masses in the juxta-articular regions (hip, elbow, ankle and scapula) without joint involvement. Histologically, lesions display collagen necrobiosis, followed by cyst formation and a foreign-body response with calcification Two forms of tumoral calcinosis have been described: normocalcemic tumoral calcinosis and familial tumoral calcinosis."
Summary of Familial normophosphatemic tumoral calcinosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Familial hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis/Hyperphosphatemic hyperostosis syn: Familial tumoral calcinosis (FTC) refers to a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the occurrence of cutaneous and subcutaneous calcified masses, usually adjacent to large joints, such as hips, shoulders and elbows. FTC can occur in the setting of hyperphosphatemia or normophosphatemia, depending on the type of gene mutation involved."
"Summary of Frontal fibrosing alopecia: Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is a form of lichen planopilaris that is characterized primarily by slowly progressive hair loss (alopecia) and scarring on the scalp near the forehead. In some cases, the eyebrows, eye lashes and/or other parts of the body may be involved, as well. Although it has been suggested that FFA may be due to hormonal changes or an autoimmune response, the exact cause of this condition is not yet known."
"Summary of Osteofibrous dysplasia: Osteofibrous dysplasia is a rare, non-cancerous (benign) tumor that affects the long bones. It usually develops in children and adolescents. The most common location is the middle part of the tibia (shin), although the fibula (a smaller bone in the calf) and the long bones in the arm (humerus, radius, or ulna) may also be affected. In many cases, there are no symptoms and the condition is discovered when an x-ray is done for another reason (incidental finding). When symptoms are present, they most often include swelling and/or pain at the site of the tumor, a break in the bone (fracture) where it is weakened by the tumor, and/or bowing of the leg. The cause of Osteofibrous dysplasia is unknown."
Summary of Diffuse dermal angiomatosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of HANAC syndrome: Hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle cramps (HANAC) syndrome is a genetic condition that causes blood vessels to become fragile. Signs and symptoms include muscle cramps, Raynaud phenomenon, kidney cysts, blood in the urine (typically not visible to the eye), leukoencephalopathy (a change in brain tissue that can be seen on MRI), arteries in the back of the eye that twist and turn abnormally, headaches, and supraventricular arrhythmia. These signs and symptoms do not often cause serious complications, however temporary vision loss due to bleeding in the back of the eye, minor ischemic stroke, and bleeding complications with blood thinner use has been described. While muscle cramps may begin in childhood, many of the other symptoms do not appear until later in life. HANAC syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the COL4A1 gene. It is passed through families in a autosomal dominant fashion."
"Summary of Non-involuting congenital hemangioma: Non-involuting congenital hemangioma (NICH) is a rare type of infantile hemangioma, which is a tumor that forms from the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the skin. NICH looks like an oval, purplish mark or bump that can occur on any part of the body. NICH is present from birth (congenital) and increases in size as the child grows. Unlike other hemangiomas, NICH do not disappear spontaneously (involute)."
"Summary of GM1 gangliosidosis: GM1 gangliosidosis is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder that progressively destroys nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord. Although the types differ in severity, their features may overlap significantly. GM1 gangliosidosis is caused by genetic changes in the GLB1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Blepharophimosis-intellectual disability syndrome: Blepharophimosis intellectual disability syndromes refers to a group of syndromes, including Ohdo syndrome and Say Barber Biesecker Young-Simpson syndrome, that are characterized by narrow eye openings (blepharophimosis), drooping of the upper eye lids (ptosis) and intellectual disability. Dr. Ohdo published an article in 1986 describing the first three cases of this syndrome (in a brother, sister, and cousin). Since that time many other case reports describing people with similar (yet variable) features have been reported. The syndromes usually occur sporadically. In most cases the underlying cause can not be determined."
"Summary of Gray zone lymphoma: ""Gray zone lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma, cancer of a part of the immune system called the lymph system. It is called """"gray zone"""" lymphoma because it has features intermediate between classical Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but cannot be assigned specifically to either type. In many cases, the original diagnosis of Gray zone lymphoma is later reclassified as a different type of lymphoma, such as nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma (NScHL)."""
"Summary of Primary acquired pure red cell aplasia: Acquired pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a bone marrow disorder characterized by a reduction of red blood cells (erythrocytes) produced by the bone marrow. Signs and symptoms may include fatigue, lethargy, and/or abnormal paleness of the skin (pallor) due to the anemia the caused by the disorder. In most cases, the cause of acquired PRCA is unknown (idiopathic). In other cases it may occur secondary to autoimmune disorders, tumors of the thymus gland (thymomas), hematologic cancers, solid tumors, viral infections, or certain drugs."
"Summary of Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia: Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a multisystem degenerative genetic disorder characterized by adult-onset proximal and distal muscle weakness (clinically resembling limb-girdle muscular dystrophy; see this term); early-onset Paget disease of bone (see this term), manifesting with bone pain, deformity and enlargement of the long-bones; and premature frontotemporal dementia (see this term), manifesting first with dysnomia, dyscalculia and comprehension deficits followed by progressive aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. As the disease progresses, muscle weakness begins to affect the other limbs and respiratory muscles, ultimately resulting in respiratory or cardiac failure."
"Summary of Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) leads to an increased risk (predisposition) of developing a specific form of stomach cancer called diffuse gastric cancer. Women with HDGC also have an increased risk for lobular breast cancer. Cancers associated with HDGC generally occur at earlier ages than those seen in people who do not have a hereditary predisposition to cancer. HDGC is caused by genetic variants in the CDH1 gene and the CTNNA1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnosis of HDGC is based on the symptoms, family history, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing."
"Summary of Aquagenic urticaria: Aquagenic urticaria is a rare condition in which urticaria (hives) develop rapidly after the skin comes in contact with water, regardless of its temperature. It most commonly affects women. Some patients report itching too. It is a form of physical urticaria. The exact underlying cause of Aquagenic urticaria is currently unknown."
"Summary of Neuroacanthocytosis: Neuroacanthocytosis (NA) refers to a group of genetic disorders that are characterized by misshapen, spiny red blood cells (acanthocytosis) and neurological abnormalities, especially movement disorders. The onset, severity and specific physical findings vary depending upon the specific type of NA present. Symptoms usually include chorea (involuntary, dance-like movements), involuntary movements of the face and tongue, progressive cognitive impairment, muscle weakness, seizures and behavioral or personality changes. NA syndromes typically progress to cause serious complications. NA is inherited, but the disease-causing gene and inheritance pattern varies for each type."
"Summary of Brachyolmia: Brachyolmia is a rare, clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of bone disorders characterized by short trunk, mild short stature, scoliosis and generalized platyspondyly without significant abnormalities in the long bones."
"Summary of Pityriasis rotunda: Pityriasis rotunda is a rare skin disease characterized by round, scaly, pigmented patches that mainly occur on the trunk, arms and legs. There are two types of Pityriasis rotunda. Type 2 Pityriasis rotunda is not associated with internal disease or malignancy. The cause of Pityriasis rotunda is unknown, but it may be a variant of ichthyosis vulgaris. Type 1 most often occurs with liver and stomach cancer."
"Summary of Dyskeratosis congenita: Dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a telomere biology disorder, is characterized by a classic triad of dysplastic nails, lacy reticular pigmentation of the upper chest and/or neck, and oral leukoplakia. The classic triad may not be present in all individuals. People with DC are at increased risk for progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), solid tumors (usually squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck or anogenital cancer), and pulmonary fibrosis. Other findings can include: abnormal pigmentation changes not restricted to the upper chest and neck, eye abnormalities (epiphora, blepharitis, sparse eyelashes, ectropion, entropion, trichiasis), and dental abnormalities (caries, periodontal disease, taurodauntism). Although most persons with DC have normal psychomotor development and normal neurologic function, significant developmental delay is present in the two variants in which additional findings include cerebellar hypoplasia (Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome) and bilateral exudative retinopathy and intracranial calcifications (Revesz syndrome). Onset and progression of manifestations of DC vary: at the mild end of the spectrum are those who have only minimal physical findings with normal bone marrow function, and at the severe end are those who have the diagnostic triad and early-onset BMF."
Summary of Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease: Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) is a form of bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia that is often associated with adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH) independent Cushing syndrome (see this term) and is characterized by small to normal sized adrenal glands containing multiple small cortical pigmented nodules (less than 1 cm in diameter).
"Summary of X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection an: X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection and neoplasia (XMEN) is a rare inherited disorder that affects the immune system. It has been reported in very few patients to date and has only been diagnosed in males. In XMEN, the number of T cells, a type of immune cell, are decreased or don't work right. Because there are not enough T cells, males with XMEN may have more frequent infections. In addition, they are more likely to get sick from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common virus found in most people. Typically, only people with immune systems that don't' work well can develop symptoms from an EBV infection. In males with XMEN, EBV infections lead to abnormal growth of lymph cells and cancer of the lymph system (lymphoma). XMEN is caused by genetic changes in the MAGT1 gene, that controls how magnesium gets in and out of the body's cells. It is inherited in an X-linked pattern in families. XMEN is diagnosed based on the symptoms, and genetic testing for MAGT1 genetic changes can also be helpful."
Summary of Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Adult-onset foveomacular vitelliform dystrophy: Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD) is an eye disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. AVMD affects an area of the retina called the macula, which is responsible for sharp central vision. The condition causes a fatty yellow pigment to accumulate in cells underlying the macula, eventually damaging the cells. Some people remain without symptoms throughout their life. Other people with AVMD may slowly develop blurred and/or distorted vision, that can progress to central vision loss over time. In the past, AVMD was believed to be mainly a genetic disorder caused by genetic changes in the PRPH2, BEST1, IMPG1, and IMPG2 genes; however, recent studies focused on genetic testing suggest that the genetic cause for most cases of AVMD has not been found. Sometimes AVMD clearly runs in families in an autosomal dominant manner, but the inheritance is suspected to be more complicated in the majority of cases."
"Summary of Medial condensing osteitis of the clavicle: A rare bone disease characterized by benign, usually unilateral, sclerosis of the inferomedial third of the clavicle. Patients present with localized swelling and persistent pain. Typical radiographic findings are expansion of the medial end of the clavicle with increased radio-density and signs of bone remodeling."
"Summary of Autoimmune pancreatitis: Autoimmune pancreatitis affects the pancreas, a gland behind the stomach and in front of the spine, and can also affect the bile ducts, salivary glands, kidneys, and lymph nodes. It is thought to occur when the immune system mistakenly begins to attack these healthy body tissues, glands, and organs. Common signs and symptoms include painless jaundice, weight loss, and noncancerous masses in the pancreas and other organs."
"Summary of Fournier gangrene: Fournier gangrene refers to the death of body tissue of the genitals and/or perineum. Signs and symptoms of the condition include genital pain, tenderness, redness, and swelling with a rapid progression to gangrene. Although the condition can affect men and women of all ages, it is most commonly diagnosed in adult males. Most cases of Fournier gangrene are caused by an infection in the genital area or urinary tract. People with impaired immunity (i.e. due to diabetes or HIV) have an increased susceptibility to the condition."
"Summary of Griscelli syndrome: Griscelli syndrome (GS) is a rare cutaneous disease characterized by a silvery-gray sheen of the hair and hypopigmentation of the skin, which can be associated to primary neurological impairment (type 1), immunologic impairment (type 2) or be isolated (type 3)."
"Summary of Familial avascular necrosis of femoral head: Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) is a degenerative condition which causes the upper ends of the thigh bones (femurs) to break down due to a disrupted blood supply and poor bone repair. It can lead to pain and limping, hip collapse, and cause the legs to be of unequal length. The development of ANFH is associated with steroid use, alcohol use, smoking, auto-immune disorders, and other medical conditions such as sickle cell anemia. Less commonly, ANFH can occur as the result of trauma to the hip, such as a hip fracture or hip surgery. Around 20,000-30,000 cases are reported each year in the United States. This condition mainly affects young, active adults, but can occur in children as well. In children, ANFH is known as Legg-Calves-Perthes disease. Most people with ANFH do not have a family history of this condition, but there are some very rare inherited forms of ANFH. ANFH is usually diagnosed by X-rays or an MRI."
"Summary of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease: X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) is an immune system disorder that occurs almost exclusively in males. People with XLP have an increased risk of infection because their body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells (lymphocytes) and blood cells. The symptoms associated with XLP vary from person to person, and even among family members. XLP generally has two subtypes, which are caused by genetic changes in different genes: XLP1 is mainly characterized by an inappropriate immune response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, leading to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or severe mononucleosis; dysgammaglobulinemia; and lymphoproliferative disease (malignant lymphoma). XLP2 is usually characterized by HLH (often associated with EBV), dysgammaglobulinemia, and inflammatory bowel disease (colitis). People with XLP2 have not been known to develop lymphoma. Signs and symptoms of HLH include fever, enlarged lymph nodes and spleen, skin rashes, and problems with the lungs, digestive system, liver, and nervous system. The heart, kidneys, or other organs may also be affected. Mononucleosis may cause fatigue; fever; an inflamed and sore throat; enlarged lymph nodes, liver, and spleen; and symptoms of anemia. Dysgammaglobulinemia causes an increased risk of recurrent infections. XLP1 is caused by genetic changes in the SH2D1A gene, and XLP2 is caused by genetic changes in the XIAP gene. Inheritance is X-linked recessive. However, in rare cases, females with a genetic change on one copy of the responsible gene develop symptoms of XLP. A diagnosis of either type of XLP can be confirmed with genetic testing. Of note, there have been males with genetic changes known to cause XLP that have not developed symptoms."
"Summary of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease due to XIAP deficiency: X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) has two recognizable subtypes, XLP1 and XLP2. XLP1 is characterized predominantly by one of three commonly recognized phenotypes: Inappropriate immune response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection leading to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or severe mononucleosis. Dysgammaglobulinemia. Lymphoproliferative disease (malignant lymphoma). XLP2 is most often characterized by HLH (often associated with EBV), dysgammaglobulinemia, and inflammatory bowel disease. HLH resulting from EBV infection is associated with an unregulated and exaggerated immune response with widespread proliferation of cytotoxic T cells, EBV-infected B cells, and macrophages. Dysgammaglobulinemia is typically hypogammaglobulinemia of one or more immunoglobulin subclasses. The malignant lymphomas are typically B-cell lymphomas, non-Hodgkin type, often extranodal, and in particular involving the intestine."
"Summary of Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum: Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC) is a disease that affects certain parts of the brain. Symptoms may include delayed motor development, learning difficulties, upper-motor neuron dysfunction (spasticity, exaggerated reflexes, and Babinski signs), dystonia, rigidity, involuntary movements, and speech and swallowing problems. H-ABC is caused by a genetic change in the TUBB4A gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, but most cases are due to a new genetic change occurring for the first time in a person with the condition."
Summary of Idiopathic spinal cord herniation: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pontine tegmental cap dysplasia: Pontine tegmental cap dysplasia (PTCD) is a non-progressive neurological disorder characterized by significant developmental delay, cranial nerve dysfunction, and malformation of the hindbrain. Individuals with PTCD may have a collection of medical and developmental problems including: hearing impairment, ataxia, language and speech disorders, feeding and swallowing difficulties, heart malformations and facial paralysis. The severity of the medical problems varies among patients. The cause of PTCD has not been identified."
Summary of Localized hypertrophic neuropathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Intraneural perineurioma: Intraneural perineurioma is a rare tumor of cranial and spinal nerves arising from peripheral nerve sheath and composed exclusively or predominantly of cells showing perineurial differentiation. It presents as a localized, tubular or fusiform enlargement of a nerve or nerve segment, usually in the extremities or the trunk, associated with a motor-predominant mononeuropathy including slow, painless, gradual loss of motor function in the involved nerve trunk with muscle weakness and atrophy and, rarely, sensory dysfunction. Cranial nerve involvement is rare."
"Summary of 49,XXXYY syndrome: 49, XXXYY syndrome is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when a male inherits two extra copies of the X chromosome and one extra copy of the Y chromosome. The condition is extremely rare with only a handful of cases reported in the medical literature. Signs and symptoms associated with these cases include severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, normal to tall stature, gynecomastia, hypogonadism, and behavioral abnormalities. 49, XXXYY syndrome is likely caused by a mistake (called nondisjunction) that occurs at conception or during the formation of the sperm and/or egg."
"Summary of Erythrokeratoderma variabilis progressiva: Erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva is a skin condition characterized by well-defined round or oval red scaly patches that may join together to form map-like patterns. Some patches are fixed, occurring most often on the outer surfaces of the arms and legs, while others are migratory - lasting for hours to days and then fading or moving to another location. Some skin lesions are accompanied by burning or itching sensations. Common triggers include emotional stress, temperature changes, mechanical friction and hot or cold weather. Skin lesions often occur during the fist year of life, gradually progress during childhood, and then stabilize during puberty."
"Summary of Carney triad: A rare non-hereditary condition characterized by gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST, intramural mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract with neuronal or neural crest cell origin), pulmonary chondromas and extraadrenal paragangliomas."
"Summary of La Crosse encephalitis: La Crosse (LAC) encephalitis is a mosquito-borne virus that was first described in La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1963. Since then, it has been reported in several Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic states. The LAC virus is one of many mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause an inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). About 80-100 cases of this condition are reported each year in the United States. Most cases occur in children younger than age 16. While most people who become infected have no symptoms, those who do become ill may have fever, headache, vomiting and lethargy (tiredness). Severe cases develop encephalitis accompanied by seizures. Coma and paralysis occur in some cases."
Summary of Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome: Cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) defines a group of autoinflammatory diseases, characterized by recurrent episodes of systemic inflammatory attacks in the absence of infection or autoimmune disease. CAPS comprises 3 disorders on a continuum of severity: severe CINCA syndrome, intermediate Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) and milder familial cold urticaria (FCAS) (see these terms)."
"Summary of Progressive bulbar palsy: A motor neuron disease marked by progressive weakness of the muscles innervated by cranial nerves of the lower brain stem. Clinical manifestations include dysarthria, dysphagia, facial weakness, tongue weakness, and fasciculations of the tongue and facial muscles. The adult form of the disease is marked initially by bulbar weakness which progresses to involve motor neurons throughout the neuroaxis. Eventually this condition may become indistinguishable from AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS. Fazio-Londe syndrome is an inherited form of this illness which occurs in children and young adults. (Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, p1091; Brain 1992 Dec;115(Pt 6):1889-1900)"
"Summary of Nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver: Nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) is a rare liver disease in which normal liver tissue transforms into multiple, small clusters (nodules) of replicating liver cells (regenerating hepatocytes). NRH often does not cause signs or symptoms (so is likely underdiagnosed), but in some people, it leads to a type of portal hypertension called non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH). NCPH refers to abnormally high blood pressure in the portal vein (the vein that carries blood from the intestine to the liver) that is not caused by cirrhosis (scarring of liver tissue that impairs its function). NCPH typically is less severe than portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis. Symptoms of portal hypertension may include fatigue, edema, itching, jaundice, and abdominal discomfort or swelling due to fluid build-up (ascites). Complications that may develop include bleeding esophageal varices and an enlarged and overactive spleen (hypersplenism). Liver function in most people with NRH remains normal (even in those who develop NCPH), and liver failure in people with NRH and NCPH is rare. The cause of NRH is not well-understood. It is thought that the liver's blood vessels somehow become damaged or inflamed, impairing blood flow to parts of the liver. This in turn may cause cells in adjacent parts to 'overcompensate' and replicate more than they should, leading to NRH. While some people with NRH have no known underlying health problems, NRH is often associated with rheumatic, autoimmune, hematologic (blood-related), and myeloproliferative disorders; chronic or recurrent infections; immune deficiency; or exposure to certain medications or toxins. NRH may be diagnosed based on signs and symptoms (when present), liver function tests (which usually are normal), medical history (including drug or toxin exposure), imaging studies, and liver biopsy (to rule out cirrhosis)."
"Summary of Dieulafoy lesion: Dieulafoy lesion is an abnormally large artery (a vessel that takes blood from the heart to other areas of the body) in the lining of the gastrointestinal system. It is most common in the stomach but can occur in other locations, including the small and large intestine. Dieulafoy lesions can cause severe and sudden gastrointestinal bleeding. Some affected individuals may only present with blood pressure problems."
Summary of Orbital varix: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Ocular neuromyotonia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Monocytopenia with susceptibility to infections: Monocytopenia with susceptibility to infections is a rare, genetic, primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by profound circulating monocytopenia, B- and NK-cell lymphopenia and severe dentritic cell decrease, which manifests clinically with disseminated mycobacterial and viral infections, as well as opportunistic fungal and parasitic infections and frequent pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Predisposition to developping myeloid neoplasms is associated."
"Summary of 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome: 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome is a chromosome abnormality that can affect many parts of the body. People with this condition are missing a small piece (deletion) of chromosome 16 at a location designated q24.3. Signs and symptoms may include developmental delay, characteristic facial features, seizures and autism spectrum disorder. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the microdeletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent has a balanced translocation where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a microdeletion."
"Summary of 17q23.1q23.2 microdeletion syndrome: 17q23.1q23.2 microdeletion syndrome is a condition caused by a small deletion of genetic material from chromosome 17. The deletion occurs at a location encompassing bands 23.1 to 23.2 on the long (q) arm of the chromosome. People with 17q23.1q23.2 microdeletion syndrome may have developmental delay, microcephaly, short stature, heart defects and limb abnormalities. Most cases are approximately 2.2 Mb in size and include the transcription factor genes TBX2 and TBX4 which have been implicated in a number of developmental pathways, including those of the heart and limbs."
"Summary of Lipodystrophy, congenital generalized, type 4: A rare syndrome characterized by almost complete absence of body fat, accentuated muscularity, insulin-resistant diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hepatomegaly, and hypermetabolism."
"Summary of Microcornea-posterior megalolenticonus-persistent fetal vasculature-coloboma syn: Microcornea-posterior megalolenticonus-persistent fetal vasculature-coloboma syndrome is a rare developmental defect of the eye characterized by bilateral microcornea, posterior megalolenticonus, persistent fetal vasculature (extending from the posterior pole of the lens to the optic disc) and posterior chorioretinal coloboma."
"Summary of CLOVES syndrome: CLOVES syndrome is a rare condition that is primarily characterized by congenital overgrowth of fatty tissue; malformations of the vascular system (the vessels that carry blood and lymph throughout the body); epidermal nevi; and spinal or skeletal abnormalities. Other signs and symptoms may include disproportionate fat distribution, overgrowth of the extremities (arms and legs), skin abnormalities and kidney problems such as an unusually small or absent kidney. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary significantly from person to person. CLOVES syndrome is caused by somatic genetic changes in the PIK3CA gene. Because these genetic changes do not affect egg or sperm cells, the condition is not passed on from parent to child."
"Summary of Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis: Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) is a chronic and recurrent eye disease which affects the superior bulbar conjunctiva (the clear layer that covers the eyeball, over the sclera) and tarsal conjunctiva (the clear layer that lines the eyelids), as well as the superior limbic aspect of the cornea (the area above the cornea). The signs and symptoms include burning, redness and irritation and tend to develop slowly over a period of 1 to 10 years. Vision usually remains intact. While the underlying cause of SLK remains unknown, it is believed that the condition is secondary to superior bulbar conjunctiva laxity. Factors inducing conjunctiva laxity include thyroid eye disease (usually hyperthyroidism), tight upper eyelids, and prominent globes. A mimicking disorder has been encountered in soft contact lens (SCL) wearers, typically with exposure to thimerosal-preserved solutions."
"Summary of Anterior uveitis: Inflammation of the anterior uvea comprising the iris, angle structures, and the ciliary body. Manifestations of this disorder include ciliary injection, exudation into the anterior chamber, iris changes, and adhesions between the iris and lens (posterior synechiae).

"Summary of Glaucoma secondary to spherophakia/ectopia lentis and megalocornea: Glaucoma secondary to spherophakia/ectopia lentis and megalocornea is a rare, genetic, non-syndromic developmental defect of the eye disorder characterized by congenital megalocornea associated with spherophakia and/or ectopia lentis leading to pupillary block and secondary glaucoma. Additional features may include flat irides, iridodonesis, axial myopia, very deep anterior chambers, miotic, oval pupils without well-defined borders, ocular pain and irritability manifesting as conjunctival injection, corneal edema and central scarring, as well as a high arched palate."
"Summary of 1q44 microdeletion syndrome: 1q44 microdeletion syndrome is a newly described syndrome associated with facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, in particular of expressive speech, seizures and hypotonia."
"Summary of COG6-CGD: CDG2L is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder apparent from birth or early infancy. It is characterized by poor growth, gastrointestinal and liver abnormalities, delayed psychomotor development, hypotonia, recurrent infections, hematologic abnormalities, increased bleeding tendency, and hyperhidrosis or hyperkeratosis. More variable features include nonspecific dysmorphic facial features and cardiac septal defects. The disorder often results in death in infancy or the first years of life (summary by Rymen et al., 2015).For a general discussion of CDGs, see CDG1A (212065) and CDG2A (212066)."
"Summary of Short stature-optic atrophy-Pelger-Huët anomaly syndrome: Among the Yakuts, an Asian population isolate that is located in the northeastern part of Siberia, Maksimova et al. (2010) ascertained a short stature syndrome involving autosomal recessive postnatal growth failure, small hands and feet, loss of visual acuity with abnormalities of color vision, abnormal nuclear shape in neutrophil granulocytes (Pelger-Huet anomaly; see 169400), and normal intelligence."
Summary of Corticosteroid-sensitive aseptic abscess syndrome: Corticosteroid-sensitive aseptic abscesses syndrome is a well-defined entity within the group of autoinflammatory disorders.
"Summary of UV-sensitive syndrome: A rare photodermatosis characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity and slight dyspigmentation, without an increased risk of developing skin tumors.

"Summary of Erythropoietic uroporphyria associated with myeloid malignancy: A rare porphyria characterized by a pre-existing myeloid disorder, skin fragility and blistering on the exposed areas, and hemorrhagic bullae typically on the back of the hands. Urine, plasma and fecal porphyrins are increased."
"Summary of Non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome: Non 24 hour sleep wake disorder refers to a steady pattern of one- to two-hour delays in sleep onset and wake times in people with normal living conditions. This occurs because the period of the person's sleep-wake cycle is longer than 24 hours. The condition most commonly affects people who are blind, due to an impaired sense of light-dark cycles. Non 24 hour sleep wake disorder can also affect sighted people. The cause of the disorder in these cases is incompletely understood, but studies suggest melatonin levels play a role."
"Summary of Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma: Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NXG) is a rare, chronic form of non-Langerhans histiocytosis usually found in older adults. Xanthogranulomas are lesions made of immune cells known as a histiocytes. The term necrobiotic refers to the buildup of broken down collagen fibers that can be seen under a microscope. The typical lesion is a yellow, thickened, or raised lesion (plaque) located around the eyes. In most cases the lesions are associated with conditions in which abnormal proteins are found in the blood (monoclonal gammopathies). NXG is also sometimes associated with blood cancers or lymphoproliferative disorders.  Approximately 50% of people with NXG have problems with their eyes, such as burning or itching, blurred vision, double vision, bulging of the eyeball, drooping of the eyelid, and restricted eye movement.  In most cases, other parts of the body, such as the trunk, legs, face, and arms, are also involved. Internal organs may sometimes be affected."

"Summary of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency: ""3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (3-MCC deficiency) is an inherited condition in which the body is unable to breakdown the amino acid, leucine (a building block of protein). Some children with 3-MCC deficiency will begin developing signs and symptoms during infancy or early childhood; however, more recent studies suggest that many affected babies identified through newborn screening will never experience symptoms of the condition. 3-MCC deficiency may be associated with episodes of """"metabolic crisis"""" in which affected people experience poor appetite, lack of energy, irritability, weakness, nausea and/or vomiting. 3-MCC deficiency is caused by changes in MCCC1 or MCCC2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."""
"Summary of Noonan syndrome: Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal development of multiple parts of the body. Features of Noonan syndrome may include a distinctive facial appearance, short stature, a broad or webbed neck, congenital heart defects, bleeding problems, problems with bone structure (skeletal malformations), and developmental delay. It is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but many cases are due to a new genetic change and are not inherited from either parent. Noonan syndrome belongs to a group of related conditions called the RASopathies. These conditions have some overlapping features and are all caused by genetic changes that disrupt the body's RAS pathway, affecting growth and development. Other conditions in this group include: neurofibromatosis type 1   LEOPARD syndrome, also called Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines    Costello syndrome   cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome   Legius syndrome   capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome"
"Summary of Hyper-IgE syndrome: Hyper IgE syndromes (HIES) are rare primary immune deficiencies characterized by elevated serum IgE, skin inflammation (dermatitis) and recurrent skin and lung infections."
"Summary of IRIDA syndrome: Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) is a type of iron deficiency anemia that typically does not improve with oral iron treatment. Children with IRIDA have too little iron in their blood, which causes their red blood cells to be small (microcytic) and pale (hypochromic). The anemia tends to be mild to moderate, but without enough healthy red blood cells, different parts of the body do not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of IRIDA are usually mild, but may include pale skin and in some cases, feeling weak, tired, or dizzy. Growth and development of a child with IRIDA is usually normal. IRIDA is caused by changess in the TMPRSS6 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. IRIDA is usually suspected in childhood due to the results of routine blood tests, but the diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing. Red blood cell levels often increase on their own in adulthood, so that the anemia no longer is a problem."
"Summary of Oculocutaneous albinism: Oculocutaneous albinism is a group of conditions that affect the coloring of the hair and eyes. Individuals affected by Oculocutaneous albinism have very light skin and light-colored irises; they may also have vision problems such as decreased sharpness of vision, rapid eye movements (nystagmus), crossed eyes (strabismus), or increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). All types of Oculocutaneous albinism are caused by genetic changes that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Familial isolated pituitary adenoma: A rare, hereditary endocrine tumor characterized by a benign pituitary adenoma that is either secreting (e.g. prolactin, growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone) or non-secreting. Symptoms may occur due to either the hormonal hypersecretion and/or the mass effect of the lesion on local structures in the brain."
"Summary of Linear IgA disease: Autoimmune disease characterized by subepidermal blisters and linear deposition of autoantibodies at the dermoepidermal junction. The accumulated autoantibodies are of IMMUNOGLOBULIN A and occasionally IMMUNOGLOBULIN G classes against epidermal BASEMENT MEMBRANE proteins. The dermatosis is sometimes associated with malignancies and use of certain drugs (e.g., VANCOMYCIN)."
"Summary of Collagenous gastritis: Collagenous gastritis (CG) is a rare condition that primarily affects the digestive system. People with CG have increased buildup of collagen in the subepithelial layer of the stomach. Initial symptoms in children and young adults often include anemia and abdominal pain, whereas older adults often have chronic watery diarrhea associated with collagenous colitis, celiac disease or both. Adult Collagenous gastritis is also associated with autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren syndrome, lymphocytic gastritis, lymphocytic colitis, and ulcerative colitis. Other signs and symptoms of CG may include nausea and vomiting, weight loss, abdominal distention, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The cause of the condition is unclear."
"Summary of TEMPI syndrome: TEMPI syndrome is a newly discovered, multisystem condition named for 5 characteristics that affected individuals have: Telangiectasias, Erythrocytosis with elevated erythropoietin level, Monoclonal gammopathy, Perinephric-fluid collections (fluid around the kidney), and Intrapulmonary shunting (when a region of the lungs is supplied with blood but with little or no ventilation). Signs and symptoms of TEMPI syndrome have appeared in mid-adulthood in all known affected individuals. The telangiectasias develop mostly on the face, trunk and arms. The intrapulmonary shunt causes hypoxia (not enough oxygen supply), which slowly progresses until the person needs continuous supplemental oxygen to support their breathing. Blood clots and bleeding in the brain have also been reported in some affected individuals. The cause of TEMPI syndrome is currently unknown."
"Summary of Pyogenic granuloma: Pyogenic granuloma are small, reddish bumps on the skin that bleed easily due to an abnormally high number of blood vessels. They typically occur on the hands, arms, or face. While the exact cause of Pyogenic granulomas is unknown, they often appear following injury. Pyogenic granuloma is often observed in infancy and childhood, but may also be observed in adults, particularly in pregnant women."
"Summary of Chronic graft versus host disease: Chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a complication that can occur after a stem cell or bone marrow transplant in which the newly transplanted donor cells attack the transplant recipient's body. Symptoms may include skin rash, mouth sores, dry eyes, liver inflammation, development of scar tissue in the skin and joints, and damage to the lungs. The exact cause of chronic GVHD is unknown. It likely results from a complex immune-mediated interaction between the donor and recipient cells."
"Summary of FGFR2-related bent bone dysplasia: FGFR2-related bent bone dysplasia is an often lethal skeletal disorder characterized by poor mineralization of the skull (calvarium), craniosynostosis, underdeveloped (hypoplastic) pubic bone (pubis) and clavicles, osteopenia, and bent long bones. Unusual facial features include low-set ears, widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), midface hypoplasia, prematurely erupted fetal teeth, and small chin (micrognathia). This condition is associated with genetic changes in the FGFR2 gene."

"Summary of Enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that is characterized by both arthritis and inflammation of an enthesitis site (the point at which a ligament, tendon, or joint capsule attaches to the bone). Signs and symptoms generally develop in late childhood or early adolescence and include pain, tenderness, and swelling in joints and at the enthesis. The knee and the back of the ankle (at the Achilles tendon) are the most commonly affected parts of the body. The underlying cause of Enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis is currently unknown (idiopathic). It is very rare for more than one member of a family to have juvenile arthritis; however, research suggests that having a family member with juvenile arthritis or any autoimmune disease may increase the risk of having juvenile arthritis, in general."
"Summary of Psoriasis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that is characterized by both arthritis and psoriasis. Other signs and symptoms may include dactylitis (inflammation and swelling of an entire finger or toe); nail pitting or splitting; and eye problems. Although the underlying cause of Psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is currently unknown (idiopathic), it is thought to occur due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is very rare for more than one member of a family to have juvenile arthritis; however, research suggests that having a family member with juvenile arthritis or any autoimmune disease may increase the risk of having juvenile arthritis, in general."
"Summary of Distal monosomy 17q: A partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 17 characterized by hypotonia, growth delay, severe global developmental delay, microcephaly, seizures, congenital heart anomalies, hand and foot anomalies (syndactyly, symphalangism) and dysmorphic facial features, including round face, hypertelorism, upslanting palpebral fissures, and micrognathia. Reported deletions involve regions 17q21-q24."
"Summary of Adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis: Adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Signs and symptoms usually begin around age 30, but they can develop anytime between adolescence and late adulthood. There are two forms of Adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis that are differentiated by their underlying genetic cause, mode of inheritance and certain symptoms: Type A is characterized by a combination of seizures and uncontrollable muscle jerks (myoclonic epilepsy); dementia; difficulties with muscle coordination (ataxia); involuntary movements such as tremors or tics; and dysarthria. It is caused by changes in the CLN6 or PPT1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Type B shares many features with type A; however, affected people also experience behavioral abnormalities and do not develop myoclonic epilepsy or dysarthria. It can be caused by genetic changes in the DNAJC5 or CTSF gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Familial hemiplegic migraine: Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is an inherited form of hemiplegic migraine. Hemiplegic migraine is a type of migraine with aura that causes motor impairment (such as weakness) in addition to at least one visual, sensory, or speech disturbance (aura) that occurs before the migraine headache begins. FHM commonly begins during childhood or adolescence. FHM is currently classified into 4 subtypes, distinguished by their genetic cause: FHM type 1 (the most common type) is caused by genetic changes in the CACNA1A gene and is commonly associated with cerebellar degeneration. FHM type 2 is caused by genetic changes in the ATP1A2 gene and may be associated with seizures. FHM type 3 is caused by genetic changes in the SCN1A gene. FHM type 4 is diagnosed if no genetic change currently known to cause FHM can be identified. Inheritance of FHM is autosomal dominant, but not everyone who inherits a genetic change responsible for FHM will have symptoms (a phenomenon called reduced penetrance). The diagnosis of FHM requires that at least one first- or second-degree relative has also been diagnosed with hemiplegic migraine. Tests such as a CT scan or MRI of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and EEG may be needed to rule out other potential causes of headache and neurological symptoms. Genetic testing may confirm the subtype of FHM in a family."
Summary of Ulcerative proctitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Non-syndromic pontocerebellar hypoplasia: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a group of conditions affecting the brain characterized by underdevelopment of the cerebellum and pons. The cerebellum normally coordinates movement and the pons (located in the brainstem) transmits signals from the cerebellum to the rest of the brain. Several forms of PCH have been described, each having some different signs and symptoms but all characterized by problems with movement, delayed psychomotor development, and intellectual disability. Although each form has a different genetic cause, they are all inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Many children with PCH live only into infancy or childhood, although some individuals have lived into adulthood."

Summary of Lymphangiomatosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 3: Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 3 (APS3) is an autoimmune condition that affects the body's endocrine glands. The syndrome, which typically affects women during middle age, results from failure of the glands to produce their hormones. This condition is characterized by autoimmune thyroiditis along with another organ-specific autoimmune disease. The other autoimmune diseases may include diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia, vitiligo, alopecia, myasthenia gravis, and Sjogren's syndrome. The adrenal cortex (the outer layer of the adrenal gland) is not involved. There are three types of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 3: APS3A - Autoimmune thyroiditis with immune-mediated diabetes mellitus (IMDM), APS3B - Autoimmune thyroiditis with pernicious anemia, APS3C - Autoimmune thyroiditis with vitiligo and/or alopecia and/or other organ-specific autoimmune disease. The cause is still unknown, but it is believed that it may be an autoimmune disease, where environmental factors (such as viral infections) and genetic factors (such as variations in the HLA II genes) are also involved in the disease. In many cases more than one member of the same family is affected with PAS III, suggesting that its inheritance could be autosomal dominant, and therefore, familiar screening is recommended. It is very important that people with APS3 are monitored closely by their doctors for early detection of any glandular problems."
"Summary of Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia: Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (HDLS) is a neurological condition characterized by changes to certain areas of the brain. A hallmark of HDLS is leukoencephalopathy, which is damage to a type of brain tissue called white matter. Another common finding is axon damage due to swellings called spheroids. Damage to myelin and axons is thought to contribute to many of the neurological signs and symptoms seen in people with this condition, including the personality changes, loss of memory, changes in motor skills and dementia. HDLS is caused by genetic changes in the CSF1R gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."
Summary of Isochromosome Yp: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis: Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is a skin condition that causes dry, scaly patches. Symptoms include a large number of small, brownish patches with a distinctive border, found most commonly on sun-exposed areas of the skin (particularly the lower arms and legs). DSAP usually starts during the third or fourth decade of life and rarely affects children. Lesions generally are more prominent in the summer and less prominent in the winter. While DSAP is usually not cancerous, squamous cell carcinoma or Bowen's disease may occasionally develop within patches. DSAP may be inherited in an autosomal dominant matter or may occur in people with no family history of DSAP. Some cases are caused by a change (variant) in the MVK or SART3 genes."
Summary of Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases due to complete IL12RB1 defic: Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) due to complete interleukin-12 receptor subunit beta-1 (IL12RB1) deficiency is a genetic variant of MSMD (see this term) characterized by mild bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) infections and recurrent Salmonella infections.
"Summary of Left ventricular noncompaction: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare heart condition. In LVNC the inside wall of the heart is spongy or grooved, instead of smooth. Signs and symptoms of LVNC vary, but may cause life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms and weakness of the heart muscle."
"Summary of Granulomatous slack skin: Granulomatous slack skin disease (GSS) is a very rare cutaneous disorder and less than 50 cases have been reported so far. The cause of this condition is unknown but it is often associated with mycosis fungiodes and other lymphoproliferative disorders such as Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Signs and symptoms include loose hanging skin and fine wrinkling of the skin or papules. These symptoms are most often located in the axilla, groin and stomach."
"Summary of Cauda equina syndrome: ""Cauda equina syndrome (CES) refers to a group of symptoms that occur when nerves in the cauda equina (a collection of nerve roots that spread out from the bottom of the spinal cord) become compressed or damaged. These nerves roots connect the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. CES can lead to pain, numbness, and weakness in the lower back, pelvic area and legs; """"foot drop""""; problems with bowel or bladder control; sexual dysfunction; and even paralysis. CES is considered a medical emergency and requires hospitalization. CES is most commonly caused by a herniated disk in the lumbar spine. Other causes of CES may include a birth abnormality (such as spina bifida), a spinal infection or tumor, trauma or injury to the lower back, spinal stenosis, a spinal arteriovenous malformation, and complications after spinal surgery. CES can be difficult to diagnose since symptoms vary and they may mimic other conditions. Tests that may be used to diagnose CES include MRI, CT scan, and myelogram (a special type of X-ray of the spinal canal)."""
Summary of JMP syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Mandibular hypoplasia-deafness-progeroid features-lipodystrophy syndrome: Mandibular hypoplasia-deafness-progeroid syndrome is a rare, genetic, premature aging disease characterized by sensorineural deafness, generalized lack of subcutaneous fatty tissue (although with increased truncal deposition) noted from childhood, scleroderma, and facial dysmorphism which includes prominent eyes, a beaked nose, small mouth, crowded teeth and mandibular hypoplasia.

"Summary of Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia-optic atrophy-dysarthria syndrome: A rare, genetic, autosomal recessive spastic ataxia disease characterized by onset in early childhood of spastic paraparesis, cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and optic atrophy."
"Summary of Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome: Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome is a rare balance disorder characterized by auditory and/or vestibular symptoms. These might include dizziness and vertigo triggered by heavy lifting, straining, coughing or loud sounds that change the middle ear or intracranial pressure, fullness in the ear, autophony (an echo or reverberation in the ear when speaking, chewing or swallowing), hearing loss, nystagmus, or oscillopsia (the apparent motion of objects that are stationary). This condition is caused by an opening (dehiscence) in the bone that overlays the superior (uppermost) semicircular canal within the inner ear. While many patients with Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome are able to tolerate their symptoms and reduce or avoid triggering stimuli, others can benefit from surgical repair of the dehiscence."
"Summary of Genitopatellar syndrome: Genitopatellar syndome (GPS) is a genetic condition which affects different parts of the body. The most common signs and symptoms (features) of GPS include abnormal genitals (for boys, undescended testicles and underdeveloped scrotum; for girls, small labia and large clitoris), missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), stiff large joints with limited movement (such as contractures of hips and knees or clubfoot), developmental delay, and intellectual disabilities. Other features may include missing the structure that connects the two sides of the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum), swelling of the kidney due to build up of urine (hydronephrosis) and congenital heart defects (the baby's heart did not form normally). Thyroid problems have been reported in some cases. Genitopatellar syndrome (GPS) is caused by changess in the KAT6B gene.. Diagnosis of GPS is usually suspected by the signs and symptoms (features) seen in the child. It is confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Infantile cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with postnatal progressive microcephal: Infantile cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with postnatal progressive microcephaly is a rare, central nervous system malformation syndrome characterized by progressive microcephaly with profound motor delay and intellectual disability, associated with hypertonia, spasticity, clonus, and seizures, with brain imaging revealing severe cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, and poor myelination."
"Summary of Distal 17p13.1 microdeletion syndrome: Distal 17p13.1 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome characterized by mild global developmental delay/intellectual disability with poor to absent speech, dysmorphic features (long midface, retrognathia with overbite, protruding ears), microcephaly, failure to thrive, wide-based gait and a body posture with knee and elbow flexion and hands held in a midline."
"Summary of Aneurysm-osteoarthritis syndrome: A rare, genetic, systemic disease characterized by the presence of arterial aneurysms, tortuosity and dissection throughout the arterial tree, associated with early-onset osteoarthritis (predominantly affecting the spine, hands and/or wrists, and knees) and mild craniofacial dysmorphism (incl. long face, high forehead, flat supraorbital ridges, hypertelorism, malar hypoplasia and, a raphe, broad or bifid uvula), as well as mild skeletal and cutaneous anomalies. Joint abnormalities, such as osteochondritis dissecans and intervertebral disc degeneration, are frequently associated. Additional cardiovascular anomalies may include mitral valve defects, congenital heart malformations, ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation."
"Summary of 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome: 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosome disorder. Symptoms may include seizures, moderate to severe learning problems, speech delays, behavior problems, trouble sleeping, and developmental delays (learn to crawl, sit or walk later than other babies). Children affected by 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome may also have low muscle tone (hypotonia), slow weight gain, and may be shorter than family members. 2q23.1 deletion syndrome is caused by the loss of a small piece of DNA in one copy of chromosome 2, one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell in our bodies. Most cases of 2q23.1 deletion syndrome are de novo, which means the deletion was not passed down from either parent. Diagnosis of 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome may be suspected by symptoms but is confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Severe intellectual disability and progressive spastic paraplegia: Severe intellectual disability and progressive spastic paraplegia is a rare complex spastic paraplegia characterized by an early onset hypotonia that progresses to spasticity, global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability and speech impairment, microcephaly, short stature and dysmorphic features.

"Summary of Karyomegalic interstitial nephritis: Karyomegalic interstitial nephritis is a rare, genetic renal disease characterized by slowly progressive, chronic, tubulointerstitial nephritis, leading to end-stage renal disease before the age of 50 years, manifesting with mild proteinuria, glucosuria and, occasionally, urinary sediment abnormalities (mainly hematuria). Mild extrarenal manifestations, such as recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and abnormal liver function tests, may be associated. Renal biopsy reveals severe, chronic, interstitial fibrosis and tubular changes, as well as hallmark karyomegalic tubular epithelial cells which line the proximal and distal tubules and have enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei."
"Summary of Linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis: Linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis (LWNH) is a rare benign condition affecting skin pigment occurring in newborns or early infancy. The primary symptom is swirling streaks of darkened (hyperpigmented) skin, mainly on the trunk and limbs. The dark streaks appear along the lines of normal skin development (lines of Blaschko). The dark streaks sometimes fade with age. Most of the time, only the skin is affected, but other conditions, such as growth, developmental, or heart problems may be present. The cause for LWNH is unknown. Genetic factors, especially chromosomal mosaicism, may be involved. LWNH is not thought to be inherited. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms."
"Summary of Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome: FIRES (Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome) is a sub-type of cryptogenic new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE). NORSE describes a condition in which a healthy person who has not had seizures before, begins having seizures. Over a few days, the seizures increase in frequency and length and evolve into status epilepticus (SE). SE is a prolonged seizure or cluster of seizures during which a person does not regain consciousness between seizures. The seizure activity is considered refractory because it cannot be controlled with standard anti-seizure medications. Cryptogenic means all possible known causes have been ruled out. People with the sub-type FIRES have a fever a day to two weeks before the beginning of the seizures. The fever may or may not be present when SE begins, but no infection can be found to be causing SE. SE can last for days, weeks, or even months. Of note, FIRES previously was considered a separate condition that occurred only in children, while NORSE was described only in adults. However, there is now consensus that FIRES and NORSE without a prior fever can both be described in people of any age."
"Summary of Painful orbital and systemic neurofibromas-marfanoid habitus syndrome: Painful orbital and systemic neurofibromas-marfanoid habitus syndrome is a rare, benign, peripheral nerve sheath tumor disorder characterized by multiple, painful, mucin-rich plexiform neurofibromas located in the orbits, cranium, large spinal nerves and mucosa, associated with a marfanoid habitus, enlarged corneal nerves, congenital neuronal migration anomalies and facial dysmorphism which includes ptosis, proptosis, prominent nose, full lips, gingival hyperplasia, and multiple subcutaneous and submucosal nodules in the lips and sublingual zone."
Summary of Onychocytic matricoma: Onychocytic matricoma is a rare tumor of the nail that is generally benign. Affected people often experience thickening of the involved portion of the nail. The tumor may be pigmented (melanonychia - a black or brown pigmentation of the normal nail plate) or non-pigmented. The exact underlying cause of Onychocytic matricoma is currently unknown. It generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition.
"Summary of Nestor-Guillermo progeria syndrome: Nestor-Guillermo progeria syndrome is a rare, genetic, progeroid syndrome characterized by a prematurely aged appearance associated with severe osteolysis (notably on mandible, clavicles, ribs, distal phalanges, and long bones), osteoporosis, generalized lipoatrophy and absence of cardiovascular, atherosclerotic and metabolic complications, presenting a relatively long survival. Additional characteristics include growth retardation, joint stiffness (mainly of fingers, hands, knees, and elbows), wide cranial sutures, dysmorphic facial features (prominent eyes, convex nasal ridge, malocclusion, dental crowding, thin lip vermillion, microretrognathia) and persistent eyebrows, eyelashes and scalp hair."

Hypermobility of distal joints, high palate, and minor skeletal abnormalities (e.g. pectus excavatum, dolichocephaly) may also be associated."
"Summary of Multifocal motor neuropathy: Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) causes damage to the nerves in the arms and legs. Nerve damage begins in adulthood and slowly gets worse over time. One side of the body may be more affected than the other. Symptoms of MMN may include weakness in the hands and lower arms; cramping; involuntary contractions or twitching; wrist drop or foot drop, and wasting of the affected muscles. MMN is thought to be due to an abnormal immune response, but the underlying cause is not clear. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and specific laboratory testing. Guidelines for diagnosis have been published."
Summary of Refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Ameloblastic carcinoma: A rare odontogenic tumor characterized by aggressive clinical course and local destruction, occurring in mandible more often than in maxilla. The most common symptom is a rapidly progressing painful swelling, but it may present as a benign cystic lesion or as a large, rapidly growing mass with ulceration, bone resorption and teeth mobility, as well. The tumor may metastasize, most commonly to the cervical lymph nodes and the lungs."
"Summary of Peroxisome biogenesis disorder: Zellweger spectrum refers to a group of related conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms and affect many parts of the body. The spectrum includes Zellweger syndrome (ZS), the most severe form; neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), an intermediate form; and infantile Refsum disease (IRD), the least severe form. Signs and symptoms of ZS typically become apparent in the newborn period and may include hypotonia, feeding problems, hearing and vision loss, seizures, distinctive facial characteristics, and skeletal abnormalities. The features of NALD and IRD often vary in nature and severity, and may not become apparent until late infancy or early childhood. Individuals with NALD or IRD may have hypotonia, vision and/or hearing problems, liver dysfunction, developmental delay and learning disabilities. Most individuals with NALD survive into childhood, and those with IRD may reach adulthood. Conditions in the Zellweger spectrum are caused by genetic changes in any of at least 12 genes and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Propriospinal myoclonus: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Spinal arteriovenous metameric syndrome: Spinal arteriovenous metameric syndrome is defined by the association of vascular cutaneous (venous or arteriovenous), muscular (arteriovenous), osseous (arteriovenous) and medullary (arteriovenous) lesions at the same metamere or spinal segment. This segmental distribution may involve one or many of the 31 metameres present in humans. Only 16% of the medullary lesions are multiple and have a clearly metameric distribution."
"Summary of Mandibuloacral dysplasia: Mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) is a rare genetic bone disorder characterized by growth delay, postnatal development of craniofacial anomalies including mandibular hypoplasia, progressive acral osteolysis, mottled or patchy pigmentation, skin atrophy, and partial or generalized lipodystrophy."
"Summary of Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis: Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is a disorder in which tiny fragments (microliths) of calcium phosphate gradually accumulate in the small air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. These deposits eventually cause widespread damage to the alveoli and surrounding lung tissue (interstitial lung disease). People with this disorder may also develop a persistent cough and difficulty breathing (dyspnea), especially during physical exertion. People with Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis may also develop calcium phosphate deposits in other organs and tissue of the body. Though the course of the disease can be variable, many cases slowly progress to lung fibrosis, respiratory failure, or cor pulmonale. The only effective therapy is lung transplantation. In some cases, Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is caused by genetic changes in the SLC34A2 gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Pellucid marginal degeneration: A rare disorder of the anterior segment of the eye characterized by slowly progressive, bilateral, non-ulcerative, non-inflammatory, clear thinning of the inferior portion of the peripheral cornea (extending from the 4 o'clock to the 8 o'clock position), with an area of corneal protrusion above the point of maximal thinning, resulting in against-the-rule astigmatism with decreased visual acuity. The central cornea is of normal thickness."
Summary of PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Progressive cone dystrophy: Progressive cone dystrophy is a general term for a group of rare eye disorders that affect the cone cells of the retina. Cone cells allow a person to see color and fine detail, and they work best in bright light. The cone dystrophies can cause a variety of symptoms such as decreased visual clarity when looking straight ahead, a reduced ability to see colors, and an increased sensitivity to light. Genetic changes in many genes have been found to cause progressive cone dystrophy, and the condition can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked manner."
"Summary of Linear lichen planus: Linear lichen planus (LLP) is a rare form of lichen planus, which is a condition that affects the skin and/or mouth. In LLP, specifically, affected people develop itchy, purple, flat-topped papules (bumps) in a linear distribution along the lines of Blaschko. Although these papules can be found anywhere on the body, they most commonly affect the limbs (arms and legs). The exact underlying cause of LLP is unknown; however, it has been associated with metastatic cancer, HIV infection and hepatitis C infection."
"Summary of Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a group of inherited neurologic disorders in which iron accumulates in the basal ganglia. Symptoms include progressive dystonia (a movement disorder resulting in muscular spasms, twisting, and repetitive movements) spasticity, parkinsonism (slurred or slow speech, stiffness of the muscles, slow movement, and visible tremors), inability to coordinate movements (ataxia), neuropsychiatric abnormalities (confusion, disorientation, seizures, stupor, dementia), and eye problems, such as optic atrophy or retinal degeneration. Cerebellar atrophy is common in many cases. There are ten recognized types of NBIA, classified according to the altered gene that causes the disease. These genes include PANK2, PLA2G6, C19orf12, FA2H, ATP13A2, WDR45, COASY, FTL, CP and DCAF17. Eight of the ten types of NBIA are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The type known as beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), caused by genetic changes in the WDR45 gene, is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. The neuroferritinopathy, caused by genetic changes in the FTL gene, is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
Summary of Brittle diabetes: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS) is a rare motor neuron disease characterized by progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Motor neurons are nerve cells that control voluntary muscle activity. Symptoms include facial spasticity, dysarthria, and a spastic gait (manner of walking). Some people have uncontrolled laughter and weeping, mild wasting of the legs and hands, bladder dysfunction, and/or sensory disturbances. The disease is usually slowly progressive but rate of progression varies. JALS includes several subtypes, distinguished by the specific variations in any of several genes, including: the ALS2 gene, the SIGMAR1 gene, the SPG11 gene, in the SETX gene.  There are some reports of JALS caused by genetic changes in the UBQLN2, FUS, and TARDBP genes. Genetic changes may be inherited from a parent or may occur for the first time in a person with the disease. Inheritance may be autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant depending on the gene involved."
"Summary of Congenital myasthenic syndrome: Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of genetic conditions that all include muscle weakness that gets worse with physical activity. There are many subtypes of CMS with different symptoms, severity, and treatments. Symptoms range from mild to severe muscle weakness and may get worse over time or only occur periodically. The muscles of the face, neck, throat, eyes and limbs are most affected. There are at least 32 genes associated with CMS. Most are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Genetic testing is necessary to tell the difference between subtypes."

"Summary of Dirofilariasis: Dirofilariasis refers to infections caused by Dirofilaria roundworms. Although the natural hosts of these roundworms are dogs, wild canids (such as wolves and foxes) and raccoons, humans can be infected with Dirofilaria larvae through mosquito bites. Signs and symptoms of Dirofilariasis generally include nodules under the skin or lung granulomas (small nodules formed by an inflammatory reaction) which may be asymptomatic. Some people with Dirofilariasis of the lungs may also experience cough, chest pain, fever, wheezing, chills, and pleural effusion (excess fluid between the tissues that line the lungs and the chest cavity)."

Summary of Gliomatosis peritonei: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Brachydactyly: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Cap myopathy: Cap myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, the muscles that the body uses for movement. People with Cap myopathy have muscle weakness (myopathy) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia) throughout the body, but they are most severely affected in the muscles of the face, neck, and limbs. The name Cap myopathy comes from characteristic abnormal cap-like structures that can be seen in muscle cells when muscle tissue is viewed under a microscope. Individuals in whom 70 to 75 percent of muscle cells have caps typically have severe breathing problems and may not survive childhood, while those in whom 10 to 30 percent of muscle cells have caps have milder symptoms and can live into adulthood. Cap myopathy can be caused by genetic changes in the in the ACTA1, TPM2, or TPM3 genes. This condition follows an autosomal dominant manner of inheritance, however, most cases are not inherited; they result from new genetic changes in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."
Summary of Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy: Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is an uncommon, inherited form of epilepsy. People with ADNFLE have seizures that usually occur at night during sleep. Some people with ADNFLE also have seizures during the day. These seizures can last from a few seconds to a few minutes, and can vary from causing simple arousal from sleep, to dramatic muscle spasms and movements. Episodes tend to become milder and less frequent with age. It is diagnosed based on symptoms and the results of tests such as an EEG. ADNFLE is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and may be caused by a genetic change in any of several genes. In most cases however, the genetic cause is not found. Seizures can usually be controlled with anti-seizure medications."

"Summary of X-linked centronuclear myopathy: X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLCNM) is a type of centronuclear myopathy, which is a group of rare, inherited conditions that affect the muscles. XLCNM, specifically, occurs almost exclusively in males and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness (myopathy) and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) that can range from mild to severe. The muscle problems impair the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking, and may disrupt primary functions such as breathing and feeding. XLCNM is caused by changes in the MTM1 gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner."
"Summary of Restless legs syndrome: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological condition that causes an irresistible urge to move the legs. The movement is triggered by strange or uncomfortable feelings, which occur mostly while the affected person is sitting or lying down and are worse at night. Movement (i.e. kicking, stretching, rubbing, or pacing) makes the discomfort go away, at least temporarily. Many people with Restless legs syndrome also have uncontrollable, repetitive leg movements that occur while they are sleeping or while relaxed or drowsy. RLS likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown. The syndrome may also be classified in several types (RLS1, RLS2, RLS3, RLS4, RLS5, RLS6, RLS7) according to the location in specific chromosomes of some of the genes that are associated with an increased risk (susceptibility) to have the syndrome."
"Summary of Hereditary sensory neuropathy-deafness-dementia syndrome: Hereditary sensory neuropathy-deafness-dementia syndrome (also known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1E or HSAN1E) is a progressive disorder of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Symptoms typically begin by age 20 to 35 and include sensory impairment of the lower legs and feet; loss of sweating in the hands and feet; sensorineural hearing loss; and gradual decline of mental ability (dementia). The severity of symptoms and age of onset vary, even within the same family. HSAN1E is caused by a genetic change in the DNMT1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
Summary of Juvenile-onset small-fiber polyneuropathy: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Simultanagnosia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Familial partial lipodystrophy: Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) is a group of diseases characterized by an abnormal distribution of fat around the body. Specifically, fat is lost in the arms, legs, and hips, and gained around the face and liver. Symptoms usually develop around puberty and include problems breaking down food and resistance to the hormone that helps control blood sugar (insulin). Insulin resistance can eventually lead to diabetes. Other symptoms may include inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), heart problems, and high blood pressure (hypertension). There are at least six subtypes of FPLD. The most common form is type 2. Familial partial lipodystrophy can be caused by a change in one of several genes. These genes are responsible for making proteins that play an important role in fat storage. Changes in any of these genes can reduce or eliminate the function of the proteins they produce. This impairs the development, structure, or function of the fat cells (adipocytes), making them unable to properly store and use fats. The condition can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner."

"Summary of Renal nutcracker syndrome: Renal nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is a condition that occurs when the left renal vein (the vein that carries blood purified by the left kidney) becomes compressed. Signs and symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may not have symptoms, while others develop severe and persistent symptoms. Symptoms may include blood in the urine (hematuria), orthostatic proteinuria, flank pain and/or abdominal pain. Some cases of mild NCS in children may be due to changes in body proportions associated with growth. It is less clear why NCS occurs or causes symptoms in adults."
"Summary of Autosomal dominant optic atrophy: Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is an inherited optic nerve disorder characterized by degeneration of the optic nerves. It typically starts during the first decade of life. Affected people usually develop moderate visual loss and color vision defects. The severity varies and visual acuity can range from normal to legal blindness. About 20% of people with ADOA have non-ocular features, such as sensorineural hearing loss; myopathy; peripheral neuropathy; multiple sclerosis-like illness; and spastic paraplegia (impaired function of the legs). These cases may be referred to as 'ADOA plus.' ADOA is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and may be caused by a genetic change in any of several genes, some of which have not been identified."
"Summary of Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma: A rare T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by infiltration of lymph nodes by neoplastic cells of T follicular helper cell origin with a polymorphous inflammatory background including markedly increased follicular dendritic cells and EBV-positive B-cells, as well as prominent proliferation of high endothelial venules. The spleen, liver, skin, and bone marrow are also frequently involved. Patients typically present with generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, systemic symptoms, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Pruritic skin rash, arthritis, pleural effusion, and ascites may also be observed. The condition is aggressive with generally poor prognosis."
"Summary of 3q29 microdeletion syndrome: 3q29 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosome disorder. Symptoms may include delay reaching some developmental milestones such as sitting, walking or talking, frequent ear and respiratory infections, and a small head size (microcephaly). Some babies with this condition are born with a cleft lip or cleft palate, and a few have been reported to have heart defects. As children with this condition get older, they may develop behavioral difficulties such as autism, and they may have symptoms of mental illness. The severity of symptoms can vary, and some people with 3q29 microdeletion syndrome may have very mild symptoms or may not even know they are affected. 3q29 microdeletion syndrome is caused by the loss of a small piece of DNA in one copy of chromosome 3, one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell in our bodies. Most cases of 3q29 microdeletion syndrome are de novo, which means the deletion was not passed down from either parent. Some cases may be inherited from a parent who is only mildly affected by the condition. Diagnosis of 3q29 microdeletion syndrome may be suspected by symptoms but is confirmed by genetic testing."

Summary of Sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autoimmune encephalitis: Autoimmune encephalitis refers to a group of conditions that occur when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy brain cells, leading to inflammation of the brain. People with Autoimmune encephalitis may have various neurologic and/or psychiatric symptoms. Neurologic symptoms may include impaired memory and cognition, abnormal movements, seizures, and/or problems with balance, speech, or vision. Psychiatric symptoms may include psychosis, aggression, inappropriate sexual behaviors, panic attacks, compulsive behaviors, euphoria or fear. Symptoms may fluctuate, but often progress over days to a few weeks. Symptoms can progress to loss of consciousness or even coma. Autoimmune encephalitis may be associated with antibodies to proteins on the surface of nerve cells, or within nerve cells. Some of these proteins are involved in passing signals between nerve cells. In some cases it occurs in association with cancer (a paraneoplastic syndrome). Research regarding why specific antibodies attack the body's healthy cells is ongoing. Autoimmune encephalitis generally occurs sporadically, in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Hypomyelination-congenital cataract syndrome: Hypomyelination and congenital cataract is a very rare disease characterized by cloudy coverings of the eye that are present at birth (congenital cataracts) and neurologic impairment that becomes apparent after the first year of life. The neurologic impairment is progressive and presents as ataxia and spasticity. Affected individuals may lose the ability to walk. Signs and symptoms may vary but can include loss of sensation in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy), curvature of the spine (scoliosis), difficulty speaking (dysarthria), seizures, and moderate intellectual disability. Hypomyelination and congenital cataract is caused by a change (genetic change ) in the FAM126A gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis of Hypomyelination and congenital cataract is based on clinical findings of muscle weakness and cataracts, and a brain MRI that indicates a loss of the myelin surrounding the neurons. The diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing of the FAM126A gene."
"Summary of Primary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis: A rare glomerular disease characterized by a pattern of glomerular injury on kidney biopsy with characteristic light microscopic changes: mesangial hypercellularity, endocapillary proliferation, and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). On the basis of immunofluorescence (IF) the disorder is divided into C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) or immunoglobulin-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Through electron microscopy C3G is further divided into Dense deposit disease, with highly electrondense deposits in the glomerular basement membrane, and C3 glomerulonephritis, with mesangial, intramembranous, subendothelial and subepithelial deposits. Secondary causes (autoimmune, infectious, malignancies) are excluded."
"Summary of Activated PI3K-delta syndrome: A rare, genetic, primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by increased susceptibility to recurrent and/or severe bacterial and viral infections (in particular, sinopulmonary bacterial and herpesvirus infections), chronic benign lymphoproliferation (manifesting as lympadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and focal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia), and/or autoimmune disease (including immune cytopenias, juvenile arthritis, glomerulonephritis and sclerosing cholangitis). Immunophenotypically, variable degrees of agammaglobulinemia with increased IgM levels, increased circulating transitional B cells, decreased naÃ¯ve CD4 and CD8 T-cells with increased CD8 effector/memory T cells are observed."
"Summary of Hereditary pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma: A rare, hereditary, pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma tumor arising from neuroendocrine chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (pheochromocytoma) or from any paraganglia from the skull base to the pelvic floor (paraganglioma). Clinical manifestations are often linked to excess catecholamines production causing sustained or paroxysmal elevations in blood pressure, headache, episodic profuse sweating, palpitations, pallor and apprehension or anxiety. Hereditary pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma tumors tend to present at younger ages, to be multi-focal, bilateral, and recurrent, or to have multiple synchronous neoplasms."
"Summary of 48,XYYY syndrome: A rare Y chromosome number anomaly that affects only males and is characterized by mild-moderate developmental delay (especially speech), normal to mild intellectual disability, large, irregular teeth with poor enamel, tall stature and acne. Radioulnar synostosis and clinodactyly have also been associated. Boys generally present normal genitalia, while hypogonadism and infertility is frequently reported in adult males."
"Summary of Pythiosis: A granulomatous disease caused by the aquatic organism PYTHIUM insidiosum and occurring primarily in horses, cattle, dogs, cats, fishes, and rarely in humans. It is classified into three forms: ocular, cutaneous, and arterial."
"Summary of Adult-onset immunodeficiency with anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies: Adult-onset immunodeficiency with anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies is an immunodeficiency disorder. It is associated with susceptibility to disseminated infections (dispersed throughout the body) caused by organisms that typically affect only people with weak immune systems (opportunistic pathogens). People with this disorder produce higher amounts of anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies. These are specific immune system proteins that mistakenly target a person's own tissues. It is predominantly reported in Southeast Asians who were previously healthy. Pathogens that cause infections in people with this disorder may include non-tuberculous mycobacteria, non-typhoidal salmonella, cytomegalovirus, Penicillium marneffei, and varicella zoster virus. Symptoms depend on the infection(s) present in each person. The cause of developing anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies is unclear, but genetic factors are suspected to be involved. Studies have suggested an association with certain HLA genes. These genes help the immune system distinguish between the body's own proteins and those made by foreign invaders. Some have suggested that an infection may initially trigger the production of autoantibodies, and repeated infections lead to their increased activity."
"Summary of Celiac disease: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that damages the small intestine and inhibits absorption of nutrients. People with Celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, barley, and in some products such as medicines, vitamins, and lip balms. When affected people eat food with gluten, or use a product with gluten, the immune system reacts by damaging tiny parts of the lining of the small intestine called villi. Because villi normally allow the blood to absorb nutrients from food, affected individuals become malnourished. Classic signs and symptoms are caused by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and may include diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, swelling, and food intolerance. However, many people have other symptoms involving many body systems, and some people have no symptoms. While Celiac disease tends to run in families, it does not follow a specific inheritance pattern. The risk to develop Celiac disease is raised by having certain forms of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes."
Summary of Mesangioproliferative glomerulopathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Congenital tracheal stenosis: A rare malformation characterized by fixed narrowing of the tracheal lumen primarily due to complete tracheal cartilage rings and an absent membranous trachea, which causes breathing difficulty."

It is most commonly found during the first years of life and presents as a slowly growing, well circumscribed mass, which may compress adjacent structures, depending on the location. Malignant transformation or metastasis does not occur, while recurrences are described especially in lipoblastomatosis."
"Summary of Primary melanoma of the central nervous system: Primary melanoma of the central nervous system is a rare tumor of meninges arising from leptomeningeal melanocytes, typically in the perimedullary or high cervical region, in the absence of melanoma outside the CNS. The tumor is typically a darkly pigmented, solid mass, often containing hemorrhagic or necrotic areas, composed of sheets of pleomorphic cells with prominent nucleoli, with frequent mitotic figures and parenchymal invasion. Intracranial tumor may present with signs of raised intracranial pressure, focal neurological symptoms related to tumor location, seizures or subarachnoid hemorrhage, spinal tumor may present with back pain, muscle weakness, numbness, plegia or urinary incontinence."
"Summary of Pineal germ cell tumor: A germ cell tumor that arises in the pineal region. Representative examples include teratoma, germinoma, and choriocarcinoma."
"Summary of Differentiated thyroid carcinoma: Differentiated thyroid carcinoma is a form of cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth of certain cells (follicular cells) of the thyroid. Many people with differentiated thyroid carcinoma have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms may include a small lump at the base of the neck, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, trouble breathing, and pain in the neck or throat. The cause of differentiated thyroid carcinoma is currently unknown."
"Summary of Levocardia: Isolated levocardia is a type of situs inversus where the heart is located in the normal position, but there is a mirror-image reversal of other internal organs. Isolated levocardia may occur alone or with heart defects, heart rhythm abnormalities (sick sinus syndrome or atrioventricular node disorder), spleen defects (absent, underdeveloped, or extra spleen), and intestinal malrotation. The cause of Isolated levocardia is not known. It is not usually associated with chromosome abnormalities."
"Summary of Nemaline myopathy: Nemaline myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. People with Nemaline myopathy have muscle weakness (myopathy) throughout the body, but it is typically most severe in the muscles of the face, neck, and limbs. Affected individuals may have feeding and swallowing difficulties, foot deformities, abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and joint deformities (contractures). Genetic changes in at least six genes can cause Nemaline myopathy. Some individuals with Nemaline myopathy do not have an identified genetic change. The genetic cause of the disorder is unknown in these individuals. Nemaline myopathy is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Less often, this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Nemaline myopathy is divided into six types. You can search for information about a particular type of Nemaline myopathy from the GARD Home page. Enter the name of the condition in the GARD search box and then select the type from the drop down menu."
"Summary of Autoimmune retinopathy: Autoimmune retinopathy represents a spectrum of rare autoimmune diseases that primarily affect retinal photoreceptor function and lead to progressive vision loss. Included in this spectrum are cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR), melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR) and presumed non-paraneoplastic Autoimmune retinopathy (npAIR). Autoimmune retinopathy typically presents in the fifth and sixth decades with rapidly progressive, bilateral, painless visual deterioration. Examination of the fundus (the back inner part of the eye) is usually normal at presentation.  The underlying reason for the autoimmune attack on retinal cells remains unknown."
Summary of Airway-centered interstitial fibrosis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy: Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN) is a rare and slowly progressive motor neuron disorder. Affected people initially experience facial tingling and numbness which eventually spread to the scalp, neck, upper trunk and upper limbs. These sensory abnormalities are later followed by the onset of motor symptoms such as cramps, muscle twitches, difficulty swallowing, dysarthria, muscle weakness and atrophy. The hallmark of FOSMN is a reduced or absent corneal reflex (the reflex to blink when something touches the eye). The underlying cause is currently unknown. Most cases appear to occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Melanoma-associated retinopathy: Melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR) is a rare autoimmune condition that occurs in some people with melanoma (a type of skin cancer) and can affect the vision. Signs and symptoms of MAR may include night blindness; photopsia (presence of perceived flashes of light); and progressive, painless vision loss. MAR occurs when the body's immune system, in response to melanoma, mistakenly attacks the cells of the retina; however, it is poorly understood why this autoimmune response occurs in some people but not others."
Summary of Extracranial arteriovenous malformation: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Immunotactoid glomerulopathy: Immunotactoid glomerulopathy, also known as glomerulonephritis with organized monoclonal microtubular immunoglobulin deposits (GOMMID), is a very uncommon cause of glomerular disease. It is related to a similar disease known as fibrillary glomerulopathy, which is more common. Both disorders probably result from deposits derived from immunoglobulins, but in most cases the cause is idiopathic (unknown). On electron microscopy, Immunotactoid glomerulopathy is characterized by the formation of microtubules which are much larger than the fibrils observed in fibrillary glomerulonephritis (30 to 50 versus 16 to 24 nm in diameter). The signs and symptoms include blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the urine, kidney insufficiency and high blood pressure. Both fibrillary glomerulonephritis and Immunotactoid glomerulopathy have been associated with hepatitis C virus infection and with malignancy and autoimmune disease. Also, patients with Immunotactoid glomerulopathy have a greater risk to have chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B cell lymphomas and should be screened for all of these conditions."
Summary of Misophonia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of GM3 synthase deficiency: GM3 synthase deficiency is a rare neurological disorder in which the brain does not develop normally. Symptoms of the disease begin within the first weeks or months of life and include difficulty feeding, irritability, vomiting, and seizures accompanied by loss of consciousness (grand mal seizures). Vision and hearing loss, spots of darker skin color (hyperpigmentation), and intellectual and developmental delays develop as the disease progresses. GM3 synthase deficiency is a congenital disorder of glycosylation and includes both cases described as Amish infantile epilepsy syndrome and cases described as salt & pepper syndrome. GM3 synthase deficiency is caused by a genetic change in the ST3GAL5 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The ST3GAL5 gene tells the body to make an enzyme that supports gangliosides, which are molecules that are important for brain development and function. GM3 synthase deficiency is suspected when a child presents with symptoms characteristic of the disease. Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis."
"Summary of Visual snow syndrome: Visual snow syndrome affects the way the visual information is processed by the brain and eyes. People with Visual snow syndrome see many flickering tiny dots, like snow or static, that fill the entire visual field. Other visual symptoms include seeing blobs of varying size and shape (floaters) and continuing to see images after they are out of the line of sight. In addition, people with Visual snow syndrome may have light sensitivity, difficulty with night vision, migraines, and ringing in the ears. The symptoms do not usually change over time. The cause of Visual snow syndrome is unknown, but it is likely to be involve how the brain processes vision. Visual snow syndrome is diagnosed based on the symptoms."

"Summary of 7q11.23 microduplication syndrome: 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is a chromosome abnormality characterized by a variety of neurological and behavioral differences. It is caused by a small amount of additional (duplicated) genetic material from chromosome 7. Symptoms may include: motor, speech and language delay, behavior problems, intellectual disability, low muscle tone (hypotonia), an increased head circumference (macrocephaly), facial dysmorphism, seizures, brain abnormalities, and heart defects such as enlargement of the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (aortic dilatation). 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is caused by a duplication of genetic material on the long (q) arm of chromosome 7. Some cases of 7q11.23 duplication syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, the majority of affected individuals have a new (de novo) duplication."

"Summary of Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency: Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is a metabolic lipid storage disease. Two rare conditions may result from this deficiency (likely representing two ends of a clinical spectrum): Symptoms include an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), poor weight gain, a yellowish color of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), vomiting, diarrhea, fatty stool (steatorrhea), and poor absorption of nutrients from food (malabsorption), as well as calcium deposits in adrenal glands, anemia, liver disease (cirrhosis), and developmental delay. Infants with this form of Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency develop failure in multiple organs, and severe malnutrition. Cholesteryl ester storage disease: Less severe and starting later in life. Symptoms may include hepatosplenomegaly, liver disease (cirrhosis), and malabsorption with diarrhea, vomiting, and steatorrhea. Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the LIPA gene, which provides instructions to produce the lysosomal acid lipase enzyme. When there is not enough of this enzyme, the body cannot break down certain fats and this leads to a a toxic buildup of fatty substances in the body's cells and tissues. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. Enzyme replacement therapy for both Wolman disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease is currently approved for use in the United States, European Union, and Japan."
Summary of Cholesteryl ester storage disease: Cholesteryl ester storage disease is is a type of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. It is an inherited disease that causes a buildup of fats (lipids) in the tissues and organs of the body and calcium deposits in the adrenal glands. The liver is most severely affected in most cases. Some people with Cholesteryl ester storage disease may develop liver cirrhosis that progresses to liver failure. People with Cholesteryl ester storage disease may also build up fatty deposits on the artery walls (atherosclerosis). This buildup can narrow the arteries and increase the risk for heart attack or stroke. Cholesteryl ester storage disease is caused by genetic changes in the LIPA gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
Summary of Autosomal dominant non-syndromic intellectual disability: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Trichothiodystrophy: A heterogeneous group disorders characterised by short, brittle hair with low-sulphur content (due to an abnormal synthesis of the sulphur containing keratins). The abnormalities are usually obvious at birth, with variable clinical expression. Trichothiodystrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder. In the photosensitive group 95% have mutations within the XPD (ERCC2) gene (localised to 19q13.2-q13.3). The remaining cases are caused by mutations within the XPB gene. So far, no gene has been isolated for the nonphotosensitive group. The variants of Trichothiodystrophy depending on their different associations are: BIDS syndrome, IBIDS syndrome, PIBIDS syndrome, Sabinas syndrome, SIBIDS syndrome, Itin syndrome and Pollitt syndrome."
Summary of Trochleitis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly: Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (often shortened to MCPH, which stands for ""microcephaly primary hereditary"") is a condition in which infants are born with a very small head and a small brain. Some people with MCPH have a narrow, sloping forehead; mild seizures; problems with attention or behavior; or short stature compared to others in their family. It normally does not affect any other major organ systems or cause other health problems. MCPH can result from changes in the ASPM gene (half of the cases) and at least other ten genes which are involved in early brain development and brain size. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Congenital absence of upper arm and forearm with hand present: A rare congenital limb malformation characterized by absence or marked shortening of the proximal to mid portion of an upper limb, while the hand is normal or nearly normal.

Summary of Eosinophilic mastitis: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Nodding syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of C1q nephropathy: C1q nephropathy is a kidney disease in which a large amount of protein is lost in the urine. It is one of the many diseases that can cause the nephrotic syndrome. C1q is a normal protein in the immune system, and can be found floating in the circulation of most healthy people. In C1q nephropathy, however, this protein can also be found deposited throughout the kidneys. It has been thought to be a subgroup of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or to be a combination of several disease groups rather than a single disease. As a disease, it is very similar to minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Criteria diagnosis includes C1q deposits on the kidney and no evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. Both children and adult patients may have no symptoms, except for the presence of blood or protein in the urine, or present with swelling of the feet and legs, high blood pressure and kidney insufficiency."
"Summary of Apocrine carcinoma: Apocrine carcinoma is a cancer of a sweat gland. Apocrine carcionoma most often develops under the arm (the axilla), but it can develop on the scalp or other parts of the body. The cause of Apocrine carcinoma is unknown.

"Summary of Crusted scabies: Crusted scabies (also called Norwegian scabies) is an infestation characterized by thick crusts of skin that contain large numbers of scabies mites and eggs. It is a severe form of scabies that occurs most often in people who have a weakened immune system or a neurological disease, the elderly, and the disabled. The symptoms of the more common form of scabies, such as itching and a rash, may be absent. Crusted scabies is very contagious and can spread both by direct skin-to-skin contact and through contaminated items such as clothing, bedding, and furniture. It is caused by super-infestation with Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis, a mite that can only reproduce on humans."
"Summary of Renal hypomagnesemia-6: A form of familial primary hypomagnesemia (FPH), characterized by low serum magnesium (Mg) values but inappropriate normal urinary Mg values (i.e. renal hypomagnesemia).

"Summary of Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome: Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome is a rare movement disorder that begins in infancy with neurological disturbances, hypothyroidism, and respiratory problems. It is characterized by low muscle tone (hypotonia) which evolves into benign hereditary chorea and ataxia, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and/or interstitial lung disease, and congenital hypothyroidism. The scope and severity of symptoms varies widely, even within families. Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the NKX2-1 gene. It is passed through families in an autosomal dominant fashion. Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome represents the most severe expression of the NKX2-1-related disorders, with benign hereditary chorea at the milder end of the spectrum."
Summary of Familial Dupuytren contracture: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of 5q14.3 microdeletion syndrome: 5q14.3 microdeletion syndrome is characterized by severe intellectual disability, absent speech, stereotypic movements and epilepsy. Unusual facial features include high broad forehead with variable small chin, short nose with anteverted nares (nostrils that open to the front rather than downward), large open mouth, upslanted palpebral fissures (outside corners of the eyes that point downward), and prominent eyebrows. The condition is caused by genetic changes affecting the MEF2C gene and deletions in the q14.3 region of chromosome 5."
"Summary of CDKL5-deficiency disorder: CDKL5 deficiency disorder is a genetic disorder that causes seizures, developmental delay, and severe intellectual disability. Seizures typically begin within a few months after birth and are difficult to control with medications. Most children have 1 to 5 seizures every day. Other symptoms include problems with sleeping, feeding, and teeth grinding. Gastrointestinal symptoms are also common and may include constipation, reflux, and air swallowing. About 1 in 5 children use a feeding tube. CDKL5 deficiency disorder occurs more often in females than males, and males usually have more severe symptoms. This disorder is caused by a change (pathogenic variant) in the CDKL5 gene that is usually not inherited from either parent (de novo). It is an X-linked dominant disorder. CDKL5 deficiency disorder was once thought to be a variant of Rett syndrome but is now considered a separate disorder."
Summary of Spondylocostal dysostosis: This section is currently in development.
Summary of PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis: Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is a rare condition that affects the liver. People with this condition experience episodes of cholestasis, during which the liver cells have a reduced ability to release bile (a digestive fluid). Episodes generally begin in the late teens or early twenties and may be accompanied by jaundice, severe itchiness, a vague feeling of discomfort (malaise), irritability, nausea, vomiting, and a lack of appetite. There are two forms of BRIC which are classified based on the genetic cause of the condition. BRIC1 is caused by changes in the ATP8B1 gene and BRIC2 is caused by genetic changes in the ABCB11 gene. Both follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."
"Summary of Early-onset myopathy-areflexia-respiratory distress-dysphagia syndrome: A rare congenital myopathy characterized by early onset of severe muscular weakness, respiratory distress due to diaphragmatic paralysis, dysphagia and areflexia, joint contractures, and scoliosis.

People with this diseasue may also have differences in their genitals, bones, and fingers."
"Summary of Childhood-onset autosomal recessive slowly progressive spinocerebellar ataxia: Childhood-onset autosomal recessive slowly progressive spinocerebellar ataxia, also called SCAR7, is a slowly progressive hereditary form of spinocerebellar ataxia. Symptoms of SCAR7 can include difficulty walking and writing, speech difficulties (dysarthria), limb ataxia, and a decrease in the size of a region of the brain called the cerebellum (cerebellar atrophy). Of the few reported cases in the literature, some patients also had eye involvement that included nystagmus (in voluntary eye movements) and saccadic pursuit eye movements. Out of 5 affected siblings examined in a large Dutch family, 2 became wheelchair-dependent late in life. The severity of the symptoms varies from mild to severe. SCAR7 is caused by genetic changes in the TPP1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of MED23: MED23 is a gene that plays a role in brain development. Genetic changes in MED23 cause difficulty swallowing, screaming spells, reflux, and gastrointestinal problems in infants. Children with MED23 genetic changes have profound learning and developmental delays impairing muscle control, mobility, communication, and speech. MED23 genetic changes do not cause changes in growth or physical appearance. MED23 is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
"Summary of Autosomal recessive ataxia, Beauce type: A rare disorder characterised by a slowly progressive pure cerebellar ataxia associated with dysarthria. It has been described in 53 individuals from 26 families of Canadian origin. The mode of transmission is autosomal recessive. Positional cloning has led to the identification of several  gene mutations."
"Summary of Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency: Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder is which a person lacks the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, a protein needed to break down fat molecules. Deficiency of this enzyme prevents affected individuals from properly digesting certain fats. This results in the accumulation of fatty droplets called chylomicrons in the blood and an increase in the blood concentration of triglycerides. Symptoms include episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), abnormal enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and the development of skin lesions known as erruptive xanthomas. Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by changes in the LPL gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of New-onset refractory status epilepticus: New-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) occurs when a person without a previous history of seizures, experiences status epilepticus (SE) without a clear cause. SE describes a state in which a person has one prolonged seizure, or a cluster of seizures without recovery time in between. The symptoms of NORSE typically begin with a mild fever and general symptoms of illness. People with NORSE may also experience behavioral and cognitive symptoms. SE associated with NORSE can last days, weeks, or months and may lead to a comatose state. A likely cause is identified in about half of all people with NORSE. The most common causes of NORSE include autoimmune disorders, paraneoplastic disorders, and viral encephalitis. Studies indicate that changes in certain genes, including the SCN2A and IL1RN gene(s) may increase the risk to develop NORSE. When the cause cannot be found, cryptogenic NORSE is diagnosed. Most people with cryptogenic NORSE experience a fever prior to seizure development. These cases are classified as a sub-type of NORSE, called Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome (FIRES). A diagnosis of NORSE is suspected in people who develop SE that does not respond to typical treatment and that does not have an obvious cause. A diagnostic work-up may include brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid studies, and blood tests. Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to monitor seizures throughout the illness."
"Summary of Isolated ectopia lentis: Isolated ectopia lentis (IEL) is a genetic disorder that affects the positioning of the lens in the eyes. In individuals with IEL, the lens in one or both of the eyes is off-center. Symptoms of IOL usually present in childhood and may include vision problems such as nearsightedness (myopia), blurred vision (astigmatism), clouding of the lenses (cataracts), and increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma). In some individuals, IEL can progress to retinal detachment (tearing of the back lining of the eye). IEL is caused by genetic changes in either the FBN1 or ADAMTSL4 gene. When caused by a genetic change in the FBN1 gene, IEL is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. When caused by a genetic change in the ADAMTSL4 gene, IEL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of T-cell/histiocyte rich large B cell lymphoma: T-cell/histiocyte rich large B cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a rare variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; see this term), mainly affecting middle-aged men and often not being discovered until an advanced disease stage, with involvement of the spleen, liver and bone marrow occurring at a greater frequency than in DLBCL. It is often difficult to diagnose due to its similarity with other lymphoid diseases such as classic Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (see these terms) and has an aggressive clinical course."
Summary of Proliferative verrucous leukoplakia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Congenital insensitivity to pain-anosmia-neuropathic arthropathy: Congenital insensitivity to pain-anosmia-neuropathic arthropathy is a condition, present from birth, that inhibits the ability to perceive physical pain. Affected individuals are unable to feel pain in any part of their body. Over time, this lack of pain awareness can lead to an accumulation of injuries and health issues that may affect life expectancy. Congenital insensitivity to pain-anosmia-neuropathic arthropathy is caused by genetic changes in the SCN9A gene and, in rare cases, is caused by genetic changes in the PMRD12 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Congenital insensitivity to pain-anosmia-neuropathic arthropathy is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy because it affects the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell, and pain. It is part of a group known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies."

Other cardiac features, such as atrial flutter or fibrillation and valve anomalies, may also be present."
"Summary of Ovarian sex cord tumor with annular tubules: An Ovarian sex cord tumor with annular tubules (SCTAT) is a tumor that grows from cells in the ovaries known as sex cord cells. As these cells grow, they form tube-like shapes in the tumor. SCTATs can develop in one or both ovaries, and may cause symptoms such as puberty at an exceptionally young age (precocious puberty), irregular menstrual cycles, or post-menopausal bleeding. Most ovarian SCTATs are benign."
"Summary of Lissencephaly: Lissencephaly is a term that covers a group of diseases that affect the way the brain looks.

Symptoms typically begin in childhood and vary from person to person. They may include muscle stiffness, muscle weakness, and attacks of weakness brought on by movement after rest. There are two forms of Thomsen and Becker disease: Becker disease, which is the most common and severe, generalized form; and Thomsen disease, which is a rare and milder form. Both forms are caused by genetic changes in the CLCN1 gene. The Becker type is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and the Thomsen type is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. People with Thomsen and Becker disease may be at increased risk for harmful side effects of anesthesia."
"Summary of Celiac artery compression syndrome: Celiac artery compression syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by chronic, recurrent abdominal pain related to compression of the celiac artery (which supplies blood to the upper abdominal organs) by the median arcuate ligament (a muscular fibrous band of the diaphragm). It usually presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, and an abdominal bruit (abnormal sound of a blood vessel when blocked or narrowed). The cause is not fully understood; however, it is suspected that there could be a combination of vascular (blood supply) and neurogenic (neurological) components involved. Diagnosis is usually confirmed with imaging such as CT angiography, MRI, ultrasound, and arteriography."

"Summary of Alacrimia-choreoathetosis-liver dysfunction syndrome: Alacrimia-choreoathetosis-liver dysfunction syndrome (NGLY1 deficiency) is a complex neurological syndrome in which there is a deficiency of an enzyme known as N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1). This enzyme normally helps the body remove proteins that are not functioning properly. The typical features of NGLY1 deficiency include abnormal tear production, a movement disorder (choreoathetosis), and liver disease. Additional features may include developmental delay, hypotonia (weak muscle tone), peripheral neuropathy , EEG abnormalities, and a small head size (microcephaly).

In this condition, red blood cells cannot access iron in the blood, which leads to a decrease in red blood cell production. The red blood cells that are created are small (microcytic) and pale. The lack of healthy red blood cells (anemia) can cause people with this condition to feel tired and weak. The iron that is not used by red blood cells builds up in the liver, eventually leading to liver problems."

"Summary of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 38: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 38 (SCA38) is a genetic disease that usually starts to affect people in adulthood. It is passed down in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This means only one copy of the mutated gene, either from the mother or the father, is needed for a person to develop the disease. SCA38 is characterized by impairment of the abdominal and back muscles. This makes it difficult to maintain an upright position (truncal ataxia). It also causes problems with walking and maintaining balance (gait disturbance). SCA38 causes involuntary eye movements that occur when looking in a certain direction. This is known as gaze-evoked nystagmus. Over time, people may also develop difficulty speaking clearly (dysarthria). They may develop problems with coordination and balance in the arms and legs (limb ataxia). Over time, symptoms may include double vision (diplopia), and damage to the nerves that control muscle movement and sensation (axonal neuropathy)."

"Summary of Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia: Idiopathic CD4 positive T-lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a rare disorder of the immune system. People with ICL have low levels of a type of white blood cell, called a CD4+ T cell. These low levels can not be explained by other causes of immunodeficiency, including HIV infection. T cells have many jobs in our immune system, such as attacking bacteria and viruses. CD4 is a protein found on the surface of many different cells within your immune system. It lets the different cells of your immune system work with each other. When CD4+ T cells are decreased, your body becomes more prone to infection. Signs and Symptoms of ICL vary. Some people have no symptoms, however most have illnesses suggestive of a lowered immune system, including infections (varicella-zoster virus, human papilloma virus), autoimmune disorders (autoimmune hemolytic anemia, lupus), and certain types of cancer (non-Hodgkin lymphoma). A few people with ICL are found to carry specific genetic changes; however, for most cases of ICL the underlying cause is not known."

The proximal muscles (those closest to the body such as the upper arms and thighs) are generally most affected by the condition. In LGMD2I, specifically, signs and symptoms often develop in late childhood (average age 11.5 years) and may include difficulty running and walking. The symptoms gradually worsen overtime and affected people generally rely on a wheelchair for mobility approximately 23-26 years after onset. FKRP-related limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R9 is caused by changes in the FKRP gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Selective IgM deficiency: Selective IgM deficiency (SIgMD) is a rare immune disorder in which a person has no immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies, or too little IgM, with normal levels of IgG and IgA antibodies. IgM is the first antibody the immune system makes to fight a new infection. Therefore, when a person does not have enough IgM, the body may have difficulty fighting infections. SIgMD can occur in infants, children, or adults. The disorder may occur as a primary disorder (on its own) or more commonly, as a secondary disorder (associated with another underlying disease or condition). SIgMD may occur in association with some cancers, autoimmune diseases, allergic diseases, and gastrointestinal diseases. Symptoms of SIgMD may include repeated viral, bacterial, or fungal infections, such as ear infections, bronchitis, sinusitis, and pneumonia. Infections may be life-threatening. Repeated infections are common in infants with SIgMD. In some people, diarrhea or a skin rash is the first symptom. Others do not have symptoms specific to SIgMD and are diagnosed when being evaluated for another condition. The diagnosis is made by blood tests showing low or absent IgM and normal levels of other antibodies, as well as diagnosing or ruling out underlying conditions that can cause low levels of IgM. The cause of SIgMD is still unclear. SIgMD usually occurs in only one person in a family, but familial cases have occasionally been reported. It may occur in some people with chromosome disorders such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome."
"Summary of Isolated congenital adermatoglyphia: Isolated congenital adermatoglyphia is a rare condition that is characterized by the lack of ridges on the skin of the fingers, toes, palms of the hand and soles of the feet. Because the pattern of these ridges form each person's unique fingerprints, people with this condition are not able to be identified by their fingerprints. While isolated congenital adermatoglyphia may occur without any additional signs or symptoms, it may be associated with a reduced number of sweat glands on the hands and feet. Isolated congenital adermatoglyphia is caused by changes in the SMARCAD1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Familial congenital mirror movements: Congenital mirror movement disorder (CMM) is a rare disorder characterized by persistent, involuntary movements on one side of the body that mirror intentional movements on the opposite side of the body. Mirror movements that do not disappear and persist into adulthood are considered abnormal. In people with CMM, no other neurologic abnormalities are present, distinguishing CMM from other neurologic disorders that cause abnormal mirror movements. CMM can be caused by genetic changes in the RAD51 or DCC genes. In some cases, the cause is unknown, but it is likely that genetic changes in other, unidentified genes are also responsible for CMM. The genetic changes that cause CMM may be inherited from a parent (familial CMM) or may occur for the first time in a person with no family history of CMM (sporadic CMM). Inheritance of familial CMM usually is autosomal dominant but may be autosomal recessive in rare cases. Not all people who inherit genetic changes that cause CMM will have the disorder (a phenomenon known as reduced penetrance). The diagnosis can be made based on the symptoms (a clinical diagnosis) which may be confirmed with genetic testing if a responsible genetic change is found."
"Summary of Non-acquired isolated growth hormone deficiency: Non-acquired isolated growth hormone deficiency is a condition caused by a severe shortage or absence of growth hormone without other hormonal problems. Growth hormone is a protein necessary for normal growth of the bone and body tissues. Because people with this condition don't have enough of this hormone, they have short stature, which is noticeable from early childhood."
"Summary of Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 5: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 5 (also known as SYNGAP1-related non-syndromic intellectual disability) is a condition that primarily affects the central nervous system. It is characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability. Some affected people may also experience seizures and/or autism spectrum disorder. This condition is caused by changes in the SYNGAP1 gene. Almost all reported cases are due to de novo genetic changes; however, the condition can be passed down to future generations in an autosomal dominant manner."

"Summary of Scheie syndrome: Scheie syndrome is the mildest form of mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 (MPS1; see this term), a rare lysosomal storage disease, characterized by skeletal deformities and a delay in motor development."
"Summary of Mucopolysaccharidosis type 4: Mucopolysaccharidosis type IV (MPS IV), also known as Morquio syndrome, is a rare metabolic condition in which the body is unable to break down long chains of sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans. As a result, toxic levels of these sugars accumulate in cell structures called lysosomes, leading to the various signs and symptoms associated with the condition. These signs and symptoms may include abnormalities of the skeleton, eyes, heart and respiratory system. There are two forms of MPS IV. MPS IVA is caused by changes in the GALNS gene. MPS IVB is caused by genetic changes in the GLB1 gene. Both forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

"Summary of Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome: Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome (MMDS) is a severe condition that affects the energy-producing structures of cells (called the mitochondria). Signs and symptoms of this condition generally develop early in life and may include encephalopathy, hypotonia (poor muscle tone), seizures, developmental delay, failure to thrive, lactic acidosis and a variety of other health problems. Due to the severity of the condition, most affected babies do not live past infancy. MMDS can be caused by changes in the NFU1 gene or the BOLA3 gene. In these cases, the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Acute alcohol sensitivity: Alcohol intolerance is characterized by immediate unpleasant reactions after drinking alcohol. The most common signs and symptoms of alcohol intolerance are stuffy nose and skin flushing. Alcohol intolerance is caused by a genetic condition in which the body is unable to break down alcohol efficiently. It is most common in Asians. These individuals accumulate acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of ethanol, because of a genetic polymorphism that doesn't allow aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) to metabolize acetaldehyde to nontoxic acetate. The only way to prevent alcohol intolerance reactions is to avoid alcohol. Alcohol intolerance isn't an allergy. However, in some cases, what seems to be alcohol intolerance may be a reaction to something in an alcoholic beverage, such as chemicals, grains, or preservatives. Combining alcohol with certain medications also can cause reactions."

People affected by this condition generally have abnormally frequent and life-threatening infections caused by pyogenic bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). However, their immune response to other common bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites is normal. Bacterial susceptibility due to TLR signaling pathway deficiency is caused by changes in the MYD88 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Warfarin sensitivity: ""Warfarin sensitivity is a condition that is characterized by a reduced tolerance for a """"blood-thinning"""" medication called warfarin. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that is often prescribed to people who are at an increased risk for blood clots. People with a Warfarin sensitivity respond more strongly to lower doses of warfarin and are, therefore, more likely to experience an overdose or other serious side effects from the medication. They may experience abnormal bleeding in the brain, gastrointestinal tract, or other tissues even at average doses. The metabolism of warfarin and the drug's effects in the body are complex traits that are determined by several genes as well as environmental and lifestyle factors such as gender, age, weight, diet, and other medications. Two specific genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes account for approximately 30-40% of variation in the response to warfarin and can be passed on to future generations in an autosomal dominant manner."""

Summary of Baylisascaris infection: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Castleman disease: Castleman disease (CD) is a rare condition that affects the lymph nodes and related tissues. There are two main forms: unicentric CD and multicentric CD. Unicentric CD is a ""localized"" condition that is generally confined to a single set of lymph nodes, while multicentric CD is a ""systemic"" disease that affects multiple sets of lymph nodes and other tissues throughout the body. The exact underlying cause of CD is currently unknown; however, it is thought to occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is a unique form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH; see this term) characterized by glucocorticoid deficiency, severe sexual ambiguity in both sexes and skeletal (especially craniofacial) malformations."
"Summary of Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency: Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (classic 21-OHD CAH) affects the adrenal glands which are responsible for producing specific hormones. There are two types of classic 21-OHD CAH, the salt-wasting form and the simple-virilizing form. Symptoms include abnormal development of the external sex organs in females (ambiguous genitalia), early puberty, and short stature. The salt-wasting form also may include the inability to retain salt and water. This can lead to dehydration, low blood pressure, and a life-threatening adrenal crisis. Classic 21-OHD CAH is caused by a genetic pathogenic variant in the CYP21A2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, blood hormone testing and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing. Classic 21-OHD CAH can be diagnosed through a newborn screen."

Summary of CASK-Related Disorders: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pernicious anemia: Biermer's disease, also called acquired Pernicious anemia, is a condition in which the body is unable to properly utilize vitamin B12. Because vitamin B12 is essential for the formation of red blood cells, this condition is primarily characterized by anemia (too few red blood cells). Affected people may also experience gastrointestinal issues and neurological abnormalities (such as paresthesia, weakness, and clumsiness). Biermer's disease and other forms of Pernicious anemia are thought to be autoimmune conditions which occur when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue."
"Summary of Actinic lichen planus: Actinic lichen planus (LP) is a rare form of lichen planus, which is a condition that affects the skin and/or mouth. In actinic LP, specifically, affected people develop mildly itchy, coin-shaped patches on sun exposed areas such as the face, the neck and the backs of the hands.

"Summary of Annular lichen planus: Annular lichen planus (LP) is a rare form of lichen planus, which is a condition that affects the skin and/or mouth. In annular LP, specifically, affected people develop ring-shaped, slightly raised, purple lesions with no central atrophy (tissue breakdown). Purely annular LP is very rare; however, annular lesions occur in approximately 10% of all cases of lichen planus. The exact underlying cause of annular LP is unknown."
"Summary of Atrophic lichen planus: Atrophic lichen planus (LP) is a rare form of lichen planus, which is a condition that affects the skin and/or mouth. In atrophic LP, specifically, affected people develop pale papules or plaques with an atrophic (broken down tissue) center. Although these papules can be found anywhere on the body, they most commonly affect the trunk and/or legs on skin areas previously affected by classic lichen planus. The exact underlying cause of atrophic LP is unknown."
"Summary of Annular atrophic lichen planus: Annular atrophic lichen planus (LP) is a rare form of lichen planus, which is a condition that affects the skin and/or mouth. In annular atrophic LP, specifically, affected people develop skin lesions with features of both annular LP and atrophic LP - ring-shaped, slightly raised, purple lesions with central atrophy (tissue breakdown). Although these lesions can be found anywhere on the body, they most commonly affect the trunk and legs. The exact underlying cause of annular atrophic LP is unknown."

Like other forms of lichen planus, it is characterized by a skin rash (shiny, flat-topped, firm bumps that are a purple color and vary from pin point size to larger than a centimeter); however, people affected by LPP subsequently develop blisters on both the lichen planus skin lesions and on normal skin. The exact underlying cause of LPP is currently unknown, but some studies suggest that it may be associated with an allergic or immune reaction."
Summary of Lipoic acid synthetase deficiency: Lipoic acid synthetase deficiency is a rare condition that affects the mitochondria. Mitochondria are tiny structures found in almost every cell of the body. They are responsible for creating most of the energy necessary to sustain life and support growth. It is caused by changes in the LIAS gene and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
"Summary of Lipoic acid biosynthesis defect: Lipoic acid biosynthesis defects are a group of conditions caused by different enzymatic deficiencies. Lipoate is a cofactor essential for important reactions in humans involving several genes (LIPT1, LIAS, DLD) which codifiy different enzymes. LIPT1 deficiency resulted in early death in one patient and in a less severely affected individual with a Leigh-like syndrome clinical features. In DLD gene deficiency the clinical features are very varied depending on which of the affected enzymes is most rate limiting."
Summary of Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis: Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) is a rare disorder that affects vision and also causes an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis). People with this condition are unable to move their eyes side-to-side (horizontally) and must turn their head instead of moving their eyes to track moving objects. HGPPS is caused by changes in the ROBO3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
"Summary of Familial episodic pain syndrome: Familial episodic pain syndrome is a rare, genetic, peripheral neuropathy disorder characterized by recurrent, stereotyped, episodic intense pain, ocurring predominantly in either the upper body or lower limbs in several members of a family, which is triggered or exacerbated by fatigue, cold exposure, fasting, weather changes and/or physical stress or exertion and may or may not diminish with age.

"Summary of Cutaneous mastocytoma: Cutaneous mastocytoma is a form of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM, see this term) generally characterized by the presence of a solitary or multiple hyperpigmented macules, plaques or nodules associated with abnormal accumulation of mast cells in the skin."
"Summary of Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy: Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) is a group of rare peripheral neuropathies where neurons and/or axons are affected. The major feature of these conditions is the loss of large myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. Myelin is an insulating layer, or sheath that forms around nerves, made up of protein and fatty substances, that allows electrical impulses to transmit along the nerve cells. If myelin is damaged, these impulses slow down. Symptoms of HSAN include diminished sensation of pain and its associated consequences of delayed healing, Charcot arthopathies, infections, osteomyelitis, and amputations. They have been categorized into types one through five, although some children do not fit well into this classification and do not all have altered pain sensation and/or autonomic function. HSAN type I is the most common form of HSAN. It is caused by a genetic change in the SPTLC1 gene and inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. HSAN type 2 is caused by genetic changes in the WNK1 gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive . HSAN type 3 (Riley-Day syndrome or familial dysautonomia) is caused by genetic changes in the IKBKAP gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. HSAN type 4, also called congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), is caused by genetic changes in the NTRK1 gene and is an autosomal recessive disorder. HSAN type 5 is caused by genetic changes in the NGFB gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Summary of Tumor of cranial and spinal nerves: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Perineurioma: A rare benign tumor composed entirely of neoplastic perineurial cells. It may occur in the soft tissues, intraneurally or in mucosal sites."
"Summary of Osteochondritis dissecans: Osteochondritis dissecans is a joint condition that occurs when a piece of cartilage and the thin layer of bone beneath it, separates from the end of the bone. If the piece of cartilage and bone remain close to where they detached, they may not cause any symptoms. However, affected people may experience pain, weakness and/or decreased range of motion in the affected joint if the cartilage and bone travel into the joint space. In most cases, the exact underlying cause is unknown. Rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member (called familial Osteochondritis dissecans); in these cases, Osteochondritis dissecans is caused by changes in the ACAN gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
Summary of Collagen VI related muscular dystrophy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Painful legs and moving toes syndrome: Painful legs and moving toes (PLMT) syndrome is an adult-onset, rare disorder characterized by pain in the feet or legs and twisting movements of one or more toes. The patients usually seek medical attention because of the pain. The syndrome may be unilateral or bilateral. Identical toe movements may occur without pain, referred to as: ""painless legs-moving toes,"" and a similar condition affects the upper limbs: ""painful arms-moving fingers."" The cause of PLMT and its variants is not known but most reports suggest an association with a peripheral lesion, usually at the level of the root or nerve, though in many cases no cause is found."
"Summary of Congenital laryngeal palsy: Congenital laryngeal palsy is also known as congenital vocal cord paralysis. It may affect one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) vocal cords. The cause of bilateral paralysis of the vocal cords is often unknown (idiopathic). In some cases, paralysis may be secondary to the immaturity of the nerve or muscle (neuromuscular) or due to central nervous system damage (including the Arnold-Chiari malformation, cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, myelomeningocele, spina bifida, hypoxia (lack of oxygen in the blood), or bleeding). Birth trauma that causes excessive tension in the neck can cause transient bilateral vocal cord paralysis that can last 6-9 months. Unilateral paralysis is usually idiopathic but can be secondary to problems with the vagus nerve or recurrent laryngeal nerve trauma. Flexible endoscopy can be used to diagnose the condition."
"Summary of X-linked intellectual disability-hypotonia-movement disorder syndrome: Syndromic X-linked mental retardation of the Snijders Blok type (MRXSSB), which occurs predominantly in females, is characterized by mildly to severely impaired intellectual development with variable other features including brain abnormalities, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder and/or spasticity, ventricular enlargement, hypoplasia, and behavioral problems (Snijders Blok et al., 2015; Nicola et al., 2019)."
"Summary of Elastoderma: Elastoderma is a rare condition that affects the skin. People affected by Elastoderma generally have increased laxity of skin covering a specific area of the body. Decreased recoil of the skin has also been reported. Although any part of the body can be affected, the skin of the neck and extremities (arms and legs, especially at the elbows and/or knees) are most commonly involved. The exact underlying cause is currently unknown; however, it generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. There is no standard therapy available for Elastoderma."
"Summary of Autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy: Autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy (AR-CNM) is a type of centronuclear myopathy, which is a group of rare, inherited conditions that affect the muscles. In AR-CNM, specifically, affected people generally begin showing signs and symptoms during infancy or early childhood. The features of the condition can vary but may include progressive muscle weakness, foot abnormalities, high-arched palate, scoliosis, ptosis, mild to severe breathing problems, delayed motor milestones and cardiomyopathy (less commonly). Most cases of AR-CNM are caused by changes in the BIN1 gene; however, some affected families are reported to have genetic changes in the SPEG, TTN, or RYR1 genes. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy: Autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (AD-CNM) is a type of centronuclear myopathy, which is a group of rare, inherited conditions that affect the muscles. In AD-CNM, specifically, the severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary significantly among affected people. In people with a mild form, features of the condition generally don't develop until adolescence or early adulthood and may include slowly progressive muscle weakness, muscle pain with exercise and difficulty walking. Although some affected people will eventually lose the ability to walk, this usually does not occur before the 6th decade of life. In more severe cases, affected people may develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood such as hypotonia and generalized weakness. These children generally have delayed motor milestones and often need wheelchair assistance in childhood or adolescence. Most cases of AD-CNM are caused by changes in the DNM2 gene; however, some affected families are reported to have genetic changes in the MYF6 or CCDC78 genes. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Fingerprint body myopathy: Fingerprint body myopathy is a congenital benign muscle disorder characterised by congenital hypotonia and weakness and by the presence of numerous fingerprint bodies located at the periphery of the muscle fibers. Prevalence is unknown. Less than 20 patients have been described. Few sporadic cases have been observed, as well as cases of recessive transmission."
Summary of Warfarin resistance: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Familial dyskinesia and facial myokymia: Familial dyskinesia and facial myokymia (also known as ADCY5-related dyskinesia) is a movement disorder that is characterized by several different types of involuntary movements. Affected people generally develop sudden jerks, twitches, tremors, muscle tensing, and/or writhing movements between infancy and late adolescence. These abnormal movements are often continuous during waking hours and may persist during sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep cycles. The arms, legs, neck and face are most commonly involved. Hypotonia and delayed motor milestones (i.e., crawling, walking) may also be present in more severely affected infants. Familial dyskinesia and facial myokymia is caused by changes in the ADCY5 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Periventricular nodular heterotopia: Periventricular nodular heterotopia is a condition in which the nerve cells (neurons) do not migrate properly during early development of the fetal brain. People with this condition typically develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy) beginning in mid-adolescence. Intelligence is usually normal, but some people may have mild intellectual disability, including difficulty with reading or spelling. Less common features include microcephaly, developmental delay, recurrent infections, and blood vessel abnormalities. Some cases are caused by changes in the FLNA gene and are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Other cases are caused by genetic changes in the ARFGEF2 gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Rarely, periventricular nodular heterotopia is associated with a duplication of genetic material on chromosome 5."
"Summary of Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 7: Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 7 (HSAN7) is a genetic condition that causes the inability to feel pain, excessive sweating, and gastrointestinal issues. Gastrointestinal issues can cause failure to thrive, painful constipation, and diarrhea. The constipation is due to intestinal dysmotility, where the the muscles and nerves of the digestive system do not move food through the digestive tract like it should. Signs and symptoms of HSAN7 usually appear at birth or during infancy. The inability to feel pain often leads to repeated, severe injuries, including bone fractures and joint dislocations. People with HSAN7 may also heal slowly putting them at risk for further complications, such as infection. Excessive sweating may cause itching. Other features may include partial insensitivity to cold and hot temperatures, mild muscle weakness, and motor skill delays. HSAN7 is not known to affect learning or intelligence. HSAN7 is caused by a genetic change in the SCN11A gene. People with HSAN7 have a 1 in 2 or 50% chance of passing the condition on to each of their children. This pattern of inheritance is called ""autosomal dominant."""
"Summary of Peripheral resistance to thyroid hormones: A permanent thyroid hormone deficiency that is present from birth. The majority of cases are asymptomatic but some may have features of hypothyroidism including decreased activity and increased sleep, feeding difficulty and constipation, prolonged jaundice, myxedematous facies, large fontanelles (especially posterior), macroglossia, a distended abdomen with umbilical hernia, and hypotonia. In 90% of cases the peripheral resistance to thyroid hormones is caused by dominantly inherited mutations in genes encoding for thyroid hormone receptor beta."
"Summary of Secondary adrenal insufficiency: Adrenal insufficiency is an endocrine disorder that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough of certain hormones. Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland at the base of the brain) fails to produce enough adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), a hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands to produce the hormone cortisol. The lack of these hormones in the body can be caused by reduction or cessation of corticosteroid medication, the surgical removal of pituitary tumors, or changes in the pituitary gland. Symptoms of Secondary adrenal insufficiency may include severe fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle weakness, irritability, and depression."
"Summary of Non-amyloid fibrillary glomerulopathy: Non-amyloid fibrillary glomerulopathy is an uncommon cause of glomerular disease. A more rare disorder known as immunotactoid glomerulpathy is a very similar condition. Both disorders probably result from deposits derived from immunoglobulins but in most cases the cause is idiopathic (unknown). The diagnosis is made with a kidney biopsy and by electron microscopy. Non-amyloid fibrillary glomerulopathy and immunotactoid glomerulopathy can be differentiated from each other by electron microscopy; the fibrils in non-amyloid fibrillary glomerulopathy are smaller and randomly oriented as opposed to the larger and often organized fibrils of immunotactoid glomerulopathy. The signs and symptoms include blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the urine, kidney insufficiency and high blood pressure. Both non-amyloid fibrillary glomerulopathy and immunotactoid glomerulopathy have been associated with hepatitis C virus infection and with malignancy and autoimmune disease. Because of this, patients should be screened for these conditions."
"Summary of Immunotactoid or fibrillary glomerulopathy: Immunotactoid or fibrillary glomerulopathy is a term that includes two conditions: immunotactoid glomerulopathy and fibrillary glomerulonephritis, which are uncommon causes of glomerular disease. Most experts feel that fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy are separate disorders but they have many similarities and some experts group these disorders together. Fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy can be distinguished from each other by electron microscopy; the 'fibrils' that characterize fibrillary glomerulonephritis are smaller and randomly oriented as opposed to the larger and organized fibrils of immunotactoid glomerulopathy which also have microtubule formations. Both disorders probably result from deposits derived from immunoglobulins but in most cases the cause is idiopathic (unknown). The signs and symptoms are similar in both diseases and may include blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the urine, kidney insufficiency and high blood pressure. Fibrillary glomeurlonephritis is much more common than immunotactoid glomerulopathy. Both fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy have been associated with hepatitis C virus infection and with malignancy and autoimmune disease, but immunotactoid glomerulopathy patients have a greater predisposition to chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B cell lymphomas. All patients should be screened for these conditions. It is also important to rule out another disease known as amyloidosis. When the fibrils are stained with an acid dye known as ""Congo red"" the results are negative. In amyloidosis the results are positive because the dye is absorbed by the amyloids."
"Summary of Juvenile polymyositis: A rare type of juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) characterized by an onset before 18 years of age of chronic skeletal muscle inflammation, manifesting as progressive, proximal and distal muscle weakness and atrophy."
Summary of ACTG2-related disorders: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction: Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is a rare disease characterized by repetitive episodes or continuous symptoms of bowel obstruction when no blockage exists. Problems with nerves, muscles, or interstitial cells of Cajal (the cells that set the pace of intestinal contractions) prevent normal contractions and cause problems with the movement of food, fluid, and air through the intestines. The most common symptoms are abdominal swelling or bloating (distention), vomiting, abdominal pain, failure to thrive, diarrhea, constipation, feeding intolerance and urinary symptoms. CIPO can occur in people of any age. It may be primary or secondary. Primary or idiopathic (where the cause is unknown) CIPO occurs by itself. Secondary CIPO develops as a complication of another medical condition. In some people with CIPO, the condition is caused by variations affecting the FLNA or ACTG2 gene. Before making the diagnosis other conditions with similar symptoms should be ruled out."
"Summary of Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 32: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 32 (SPG32) is a rare, complex type of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by a slowly progressive spastic paraplegia (with walking difficulties appearing at onset at 6-7 years of age) associated with mild intellectual disability. Brain imaging reveals thin corpus callosum, cortical and cerebellar atrophy, and pontine dysraphia. The SPG32 phenotype has been mapped to a locus on chromosome 14q12-q21."
Summary of Hypertrichosis universalis: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Acute myeloid leukemia: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. Conditions are generally called ""acute"" when they develop quickly and have an aggressive course. The signs and symptoms of AML vary but may include easy bruising; bone pain or tenderness; fatigue; fever; frequent nosebleeds; bleeding from the gums; shortness of breath; and/or weightloss. AML is one of the most common types of leukemia among adults and is rarely diagnosed in people under age 40. There are many potential causes of AML such as certain blood disorders, inherited syndromes, environmental exposures, and drug exposures; however, most people who develop AML have no identifiable risk factor."
"Summary of Acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic anomaly: A group of acute myeloid leukemias characterized by recurrent genetic abnormalities, mainly balanced translocations. (WHO, 2001)"

It may occur spontaneously or be provoked by various precipitating factors, the most common being postpartum and exposure to various vasoactive substances such as illicit drugs and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. The major complication is ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke."
"Summary of Multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome type 2: Multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome type 2 (MCAHS2) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, low muscle tone (hypotonia) at birth, myoclonic seizures (which cause jerks or twitches of the upper body, arms, or legs), and various other problems involving the central nervous system, heart, and urinary system. Specific symptoms (especially those not involving the nervous system) and severity vary from person to person, but most children develop severe developmental delay and intellectual disability. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the PIGA gene on the X chromosome and inheritance is X-linked recessive, so it typically affects boys. However, in some cases, MCAHS2 is not inherited from a parent and is the result of a new genetic change occurring for the first time in a person with MCAHS2 (a de novo genetic change)."

Livedoid vasculopathy may occur alone or in combination with another condition, such as lupus or thrombophilia."
"Summary of Juvenile ossifying fibroma: ""Juvenile ossifying fibroma (JOF) is rare, benign tumor of the craniofacial (skull and face) bones. It is considered a """"fibro-osseous neoplasm"""" because it is characterized by an overgrowth of bone. Affected people generally experience a gradual or rapid, painless expansion of the affected bone or region. Other symptoms such as exophthalmos or nasal blockage can rarely be associated with the tumor depending on its exact location.

"Summary of Autosomal recessive generalized dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, intermediate f: A rare dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) characterized by generalized cutaneous and mucosal blistering that is not associated with severe deformities."
"Summary of Dentinogenesis imperfecta type 2: Dentinogenesis imperfecta type 2 is a rare and severe form of dentinogenesis imperfecta, a condition that affects tooth development. People affected by the condition may have weak and discolored teeth. These problems can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. People with this form of dentinogenesis imperfecta have no normal teeth. Sensorineural hearing loss has also been found in some affected people. Dentinogenesis imperfecta type 2 is caused by changes in the DSPP gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease: Early-onset, autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease is a form of Alzheimer disease (AD) that develops before the age of 65. It is diagnosed in families that have more than one member with AD (usually multiple persons in more than one generation) in which the age of onset is consistently before age 60 and often between the ages of 30 and 60 years. In general, AD is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes gradual loss of memory, judgement, and the ability to function socially. (1) Alzheimer disease, type 1 is caused by genetic changes in the APP gene (2) Alzheimer disease, type 3 is caused by genetic changes in the PSEN1 gene    (3) Alzheimer disease, type 4 is caused by genetic changes in the PSEN2 gene."
"Summary of Alzheimer disease 2: Alzheimer disease 2 is a form of familial Alzheimer disease that begins after age 65. In general, Alzheimer disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes gradual loss of memory, judgement and the ability to function socially. The exact underlying cause of late-onset familial AD is not completely understood. A gene called APOE has been studied extensively as a risk factor for the disease. In particular, a variant of this gene called the ""e4 allele"" seems to increase an individual's risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer disease (people who have this allele are said to have the late-onset familial AD type 2). It is important to understand that APOE is a susceptibility gene, not a determinative gene, which means that people having two copies of this allele have an increased risk of having AD but not necessarily will have it."
"Summary of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome: PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome refers to a spectrum of conditions that are characterized by multiple hamartomas. These conditions include:    Cowden syndrome - associated with a high risk for benign and malignant (cancerous) tumors of the thyroid, breast, and uterus. Affected people may also have macrocephaly and characteristic skin abnormalities. Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome - characterized by macrocephaly (large head size), hamartomas of the intestines (called hamartomatous intestinal polyps), and dark freckles on the penis. Proteus syndrome - characterized by overgrowth of the bones, skin, and other tissues. Proteus-like syndrome - people with many of the signs and symptoms associated with Proteus syndrome, but who do not meet the diagnostic criteria. PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome is caused by changes in the PTEN gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Proteus-like syndrome: Proteus-like syndrome describes people who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for Proteus syndrome but who share many of the characteristic signs and symptoms associated with the condition. Affected people may experience some of the following features: overgrowth of the bones, skin, and other tissues; hamartomas; abnormalities of the skin, blood vessels (vascular tissue) and fat (adipose tissue); and distinctive facial features.

It can be associated with a variety of clinical syndromes including invasive sinusitis; nodules or abscesses beneath the skin; keratitis; lung masses; osteomyelitis; mycotic arthritis; endocarditis; brain abscess; and wide-spread infection. Although the condition can affect anyone, it is most commonly diagnosed in people with suppressed immune systems (like those who have undergone an organ transplant) and can even be life-threatening in these populations."
"Summary of Multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome: Multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome is a disease in which the activity of smooth muscle throughout the body is impaired. This leads to widespread problems including blood vessel abnormalities, a decreased response of the pupils to light, a weak bladder, and weakened contractions of the muscles used for the digestion of food (hypoperistalsis). A certain genetic change in the ACTA2 gene has been shown to cause this condition in some individuals."
"Summary of Pustular psoriasis: ""Pustular psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that is characterized by widespread pustules and reddish skin. This condition can occur alone or with plaque-type psoriasis. Most cases of Pustular psoriasis are thought to be """"multifactorial"""" or associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. There are several triggers for this conditions including withdrawal from corticosteroids, exposure to various medications and/or infections. Some cases of the generalized form are caused by changes in the IL36RN gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required."""
"Summary of 8q24.3 microdeletion syndrome: Chromosome 8q24.3 deletion syndrome is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on chromosome 8 at a location designated q24.3. The signs and symptoms vary but may include slow growth, developmental delay, characteristic facial features, and skeletal abnormalities. Some affected people may also have coloboma, kidney abnormalities, and heart defects. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children."
"Summary of Severe intellectual disability-poor language-strabismus-grimacing face-long fing: Severe intellectual disability-poor language-strabismus-grimacing face-long fingers syndrome (also known as GATAD2B-associated neurodevelopmental disorder or GAND) affects the way the brain develops. Symptoms of GAND include moderate to severe intellectual disability, poor speech development, and large head size. Other signs and symptoms may include low muscle tone in children (childhood hypotonia), feeding problems, heart problems and shared facial features. Because so few cases have been described in the medical literature, it is difficult to know how this condition changes over time. GAND is caused by a GATAD2B gene that is absent or not working correctly. It usually occurs in a family for the first time due to a new genetic change (de novo) and may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. GAND is diagnosed based on the symptoms, a clinical exam and genetic testing."
"Summary of 8q12 microduplication syndrome: The newly described 8q12 microduplication syndrome is associated with unusual and characteristic multi-organ clinical features, which include hearing loss, congenital heart defects, intellectual disability, hypotonia in infancy, and Duane anomaly (see this term)."
"Summary of Generalized pustular psoriasis: Generalized pustular psoriasis is a severe inflammatory skin condition that can be life-threatening. Affected people develop episodes of red and tender skin with widespread pustules throughout their body. This is generally accompanied by fever, chills, headache, rapid pulse rate, loss of appetite, nausea and muscle weakness. The condition generally resolves within days or weeks; however, relapses are common. Some cases of Generalized pustular psoriasis are caused by changes in the IL36RN gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Possible triggers for sporadic forms of the condition include withdrawal from corticosteroids, exposure to certain medications, and/or infection; however, in many cases, the underlying cause is unknown."
"Summary of Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris: Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP) is a rare and chronic inflammatory condition that primarily affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Signs and symptoms of the condition generally develop during adulthood and include crops of pustules on one or both hands and/or feet that erupt repeatedly over time. Affected individuals may also experience itching (pruritus), pain, or a burning sensation. The classification of PPP is controversial. Some have proposed that PPP is a variant of psoriasis, while others believe it to be a separate disease. Though the area of involvement is often limited, PPP can have a significant effect on quality of life and can interfere with walking or other daily activities."

Summary of Adult-onset nemaline myopathy: A rapidly progressive type of nemaline myopathy (NM) characterized by a very late onset.
"Summary of FOXG1 syndrome: FOXG1 syndrome is a neurological condition characterized by impaired development and structural brain abnormalities. Features vary from case to case, and may include an unusually small head size (microcephaly), a specific pattern of brain development (including partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, reduced folds on the surface of the brain, and reduced white matter), intellectual disability, abnormal or involuntary movements, feeding problems, sleep disturbances, seizures, irritability and excessive crying, and limited communication and social skills. Both males and females may be affected. The condition is caused by changes involving the FOXG1 gene. In some cases, there are genetic changes within the gene; in others, there is a deletion of genetic material from the region of the long (q) arm of chromosome 14 where the gene is located. FOXG1 syndrome is considered an autosomal dominant condition because one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. While it is possible for parents to be carriers, most cases result from new genetic changes."
"Summary of Pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection: Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease is an infectious condition caused by certain types of mycobacteria. Some people with NTM lung disease have no signs or symptoms, while others experience a severe cough, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), shortness of breath, fatigue, fever, night sweats and/or weightloss. Mycobacteria are found naturally in soil and water. Most people who are exposed to these bacteria do not become sick. However, people who have a weakened immune system or other health conditions (i.e. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, pneumoconiosis, cystic fibrosis, and previous tuberculosis) have an elevated risk of developing NTM lung disease."
"Summary of Acute interstitial pneumonia: Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) is a rare and serious condition that affects the lungs. The signs and symptoms generally develop and progress rapidly.

"Summary of Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis: Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis (DPL) is a rare condition which is characterized by nodules or small lumps of smooth muscle cells located on the peritoneum (lining of the abdominal wall) and abdominal organs.The condition is usually benign (noncancerous) but in rare cases has become cancerous. Although it can be seen in post-menopausal women and very rarely in men, DPL occurs most often in women of childbearing age. Most women with DPL are pregnant, taking the birth control pill, or have uterine leioyomas or estrogen-secreting tumors. Some people with DPL have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms may include abdominal and pelvic pain; rectal or vaginal bleeding; and less commonly constipation. The cause of DPL is unknown but may be linked to hormonal and genetic factors. Some cases of DPL resolve when hormone levels are returned to normal. However, surgery may be suggested based on the size and location of the tumor."
"Summary of High myopia-sensorineural deafness syndrome: High myopia-sensorineural hearing loss syndrome is rare condition that affects both hearing and vision. Beginning at birth or in early infancy, people with this condition have moderate to profound hearing loss in both ears that generally becomes worse over time. Affected people also develop severe myopia (nearsightedness) later in infancy or early childhood. High myopia-sensorineural hearing loss syndrome is caused by changes in the SLITRK6 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."

It comprises two sub-types: the non-inflammatory (PSS type A) and the inflammatory (PSS type B) form (see these terms). PSS type A is characterized by generalized white scaling with superficial peeling of the skin, while PSS type B is characterized by superficial patchy peeling of the entire skin with underlying erythroderma, associated with pruritus, and atopy."
"Summary of Acral peeling skin syndrome: Acral peeling skin syndrome is a genetic skin disorder characterized by painless peeling of the top layer of skin. Acral refers to the fact that the peeling is most apparent on the hands and feet, although peeling may also occur on the arms and legs. The peeling is usually present from birth, but can appear later in childhood or early adulthood. Acral peeling skin syndrome can be caused by genetic changes in the TGM5 gene. Genetic changes in the CSTA gene have also been linked to this condition. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Hyperlipidemia due to hepatic triacylglycerol lipase deficiency: Hyperlipidemia due to hepatic triacylglycerol lipase deficiency is a rare condition that is characterized by increased levels of certain fats (known as triglycerides and cholesterol) in the blood. Affected people may also have increased levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) and decreased levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are two molecules that help transport fats throughout the body. Hyperlipidemia due to hepatic triacylglycerol lipase deficiency is caused by changes in the LIPC gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Cushing disease: Cushing disease is a condition characterized by elevated levels of a hormone called cortisol secreted by a tumor in the pituitary gland. It is characterized by signs and symptoms that may include weight gain around the trunk and in the face, stretch marks, easy bruising, a hump on the upper back, muscle weakness, tiredness, thin bones that are prone to fracture (osteoporosis), mood disorders and memory problems, as well as an increased risk of infections, high blood pressure and diabetes. Women may have irregular menses and a lot of hair in the body (hirsutism). It occurs when a benign pituitary tumor (adenoma) or pituitary hyperplasia causes the adrenal glands to produce large amounts of cortisol. Some cases are caused by somatic genetic changes in the AIP and the GNAS genes. Rarely, Cushing disease can be inherited, either as an isolated condition or as part of a genetic syndrome (such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and familial isolated pituitary adenoma), but most cases are sporadic."
"Summary of IRVAN syndrome: IRVAN syndrome is an acronym for ""idiopathic retinal vasculitis-aneurysms-neuroretinitis syndrome,"" a condition that primarily affects the eyes. The severity of the condition varies from person to person with some affected people experiencing a mild form that resolves on its own and others experiencing a severe form that may progress to vitreous hemorrhage (leakage of blood into the eye), vision loss and/or glaucoma. The underlying cause of IRVAN syndrome is currently unknown. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Isolated childhood apraxia of speech: Childhood apraxia of speech occurs in children and is present from birth. It appears to be more common in boys than girls. Children with this condition have difficulty planning and producing the precise, refined, and specific movements of the tongue, lips, jaw, and palate that are necessary for intelligible speech. In many cases, the underlying cause of Childhood apraxia of speech is unknown (idiopathic). Some cases are associated with a known neurological cause (such as intrauterine or early childhood stroke, infection, trauma, brain cancer or tumor resection, traumatic brain injury, etc.), and other cases occur as part of a complex neurobehavioral disorder (such as autism, epilepsy, fragile X syndrome, galactosemia, Rett syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome or certain types of chromosome abnormalities). In some cases, genetic changes in the FOXP2 gene or loss of genetic material involving this gene may cause Childhood apraxia of speech."
"Summary of Infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to MRPL44 deficiency: Infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to MRPL44 deficiency is characterized by decreased levels of mitochondrial complexes. The symptoms and signs described include an enlarged heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and fatty liver (hepatic steatosis), as well as eye problems, headache, paralysis of one side of the body, Leigh-like lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), kidney insufficiency and neurological disease. It is caused by genetic changes in the  MRPL44 gene, which results in mitochondrial dysfunction. The cases described seem to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
Summary of Leukoencephalopathy-thalamus and brainstem anomalies-high lactate syndrome: Leukoencephalopathy-thalamus and brainstem anomalies-high lactate syndrome is a disease that affects many parts of the body. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
"Summary of Zika virus disease: Zika virus infection is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito. Zika virus can also be spread from a pregnant mother to her child and through sexual contact with an affected partner. Cases of Zika virus transmission via blood transfusion have also been reported. Zika virus outbreaks are currently occurring in many countries. The illness associated with Zika virus infection is usually mild, with symptoms lasting for several days to a week. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The full range of health problems associated with Zika virus infection during pregnancy is currently being studied.  No vaccine currently exists to prevent Zika virus infection, but there are still ways to protect oneself. The CDC recommends that pregnant women consider postponing travel to Zika-affected areas. People living in or traveling to areas where Zika virus is found should take steps to prevent mosquito bites. Those who have traveled to Zika-affected areas may wish to take steps to prevent sexual transmission of the Zika virus."
"Summary of Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4 (EIEE4) is a form of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, which refers to a group of neurological conditions characterized by severe seizures beginning in infancy. EIEE4, specifically, is often associated with partial complex or tonic-clonic seizures, although other seizure types have been reported. Other signs and symptoms may include intellectual disability, reduced muscle tone (hypotonia), hypsarrhythmia (an irregular pattern seen on EEG), dyskinesia (involuntary movement of the body), and spastic di- or quadriplegia. EIEE4 is caused by changes in the STXBP1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."
"Summary of Optic atrophy-intellectual disability syndrome: Optic atrophy-intellectual disability syndrome is a rare, hereditary condition. It affects a person's brain and vision. It is characterized by developmental delay and intellectual disability. It can also significantly affect vision due to damage to the optic nerve or other affects on the brain's visual system. Common symptoms include hypotonia (weakened muscle tone). This condition also causes oromotor dysfunction (difficulty moving the mouth and tongue). It can also cause seizures, autism spectrum disorder, and repetitive behaviors. People with this syndrome may also have facial features that are not typical for their family. These features can vary greatly and are not specific to this condition."
Summary of Duarte Galactosemia: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Scleritis: Inflammation of the sclera.
"Summary of Polyhydramnios-megalencephaly-symptomatic epilepsy syndrome: Polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy syndrome (PMSE syndrome) is characterized by excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby in the uterus during pregnancy (polyhydramnios), abnormally large, heavy, and usually malfunctioning brain (megalencephaly), seizures and intellectual disability. Some patients also have heart problems, diabetes insipidus, kidney problems and leukemia. It is caused by a genetic change in the LYK5 gene."
"Summary of X-linked mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases due to IKBKG deficie: Immunodeficiency-33 (IMD33) is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects only males. It is characterized by early-onset severe infections, usually due to pneumococcus, H. influenzae, and atypical mycobacteria, although other organisms have also been detected. Immunologic investigations may show variable abnormalities or may be normal. Disturbances include dysgammaglobulinemia with hypogammaglobulinemia, decreased IgG2, aberrant levels of IgM and IgA, and decreased class-switched memory B cells. There is often poor, but variable, response to vaccination; in particular, most patients do not develop antibodies to certain polysaccharide vaccines, notably pneumococcus. Other immunologic abnormalities may include impaired NK cytotoxic function, impaired cytokine production upon stimulation with IL1B (147720) or TNFA (191160), low IL6 (147620), low IL12 (see 161561), and decreased IFNG (147570). Patients do not have overt abnormalities of T-cell proliferation, although signaling pathways, such as CD40LG (300386)/CD40 (109535), may be disturbed. There is heterogeneity in the immunologic phenotype, resulting in highly variable clinical courses, most likely due to the different effects of hypomorphic mutations. Treatment with antibiotics and IVIg is usually beneficial; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may not be necessary, but can be effective. Features of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia are generally not present, although some patients may have conical teeth or hypodontia (summary by Orange et al., 2004, Filipe-Santos et al., 2006, Salt et al., 2008, Heller et al., 2020)."
"Summary of Rh deficiency syndrome: The Rh deficiency syndrome, also known as Rh-null syndrome, is a blood disorder where people have red blood cells (RBCs) lacking all Rh antigens. The Rh antigens maintain the integrity of the RBC membrane and therefore, RBCs which lack Rh antigens have an abnormal shape. There are two types of Rh deficiency syndrome: The regulator type is associated with many different changes in the RHAG gene . The amorph type is caused by inactive copies of a gene (silent alleles) at the RH locus. As a result, the RBCs do not express any of the Rh antigens. The absence of the Rh complex alters the RBC shape, increases its tendency to break down (osmotic fragility), and shortens its lifespan, resulting in a hemolytic anemia that is usually mild. These patients are at risk of having adverse transfusion reactions because they may produce antibodies against several of the Rh antigens and can only receive blood from people who have the same condition. Rh deficiency syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Malignant migrating focal seizures of infancy: Malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (MMPSI) is a severe form of epilepsy, a condition characterized by recurrent seizures. In MMPSI, specifically, partial seizures generally begin shortly after birth and are often not responsive to treatment. Although the seizures may occur relatively infrequently in the beginning, within a few months the frequency increases drastically with some affected people experiencing clusters of 5 to 30 seizures several times per day. Signs and symptoms associated with these episodes vary based on which part of the brain is affected during a given seizure. Although the underlying cause of MMPSI is not fully understood, de novo genetic changes in certain genes have been identified in several affected people and are thought to be involved in the development of the condition. Even when a genetic cause is identified, most cases of MMPSI occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition."
"Summary of Familial multiple lipomatosis: Familial multiple lipomatosis (FML) is a rare condition that is characterized by multiple lipomas on the trunk and extremities. As the name suggests, FML is diagnosed when multiple lipomatosis occurs in more than one family member, often over several generations. The lipomas associated with FML are usually painless, but may impact quality of life as they can be numerous and large. Although the condition appears to be passed down through families in an autosomal dominant manner, the underlying genetic cause is currently unknown."
"Summary of Acute sensorineural hearing loss by acute acoustic trauma or sudden deafness or: Sudden sensorineural deafness is a condition that is characterized by rapid, unexplained hearing loss. More specifically, affected people experience a reduction in hearing of greater than 30 decibels, which may occur all at once or over several days. In most cases, only one ear is affected. People with sudden sensorineural deafness often become dizzy, have ringing in their ears (tinnitus), or both (40% of the cases). The condition has a variety of causes, including infection, inflammation, tumors, trauma, exposure to toxins and conditions that affect the inner ear such as MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease."
Summary of Anonychia congenita: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of ADNP syndrome: ADNP syndrome, also known as Helsmoortel-van der Aa syndrome, is a complex neuro-developmental disorder that affects the brain and many other areas and functions of the body. ADNP syndrome can affect muscle tone, feeding, growth, hearing, vision, sleep, fine and gross motor skills, as well as the immune system, heart, endocrine system, and gastrointestinal tract. ADNP syndrome causes behavior disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ADNP is caused by a non-inherited (de novo) ADNP genetic change. ADNP syndrome is thought to be one of the most common causes of non-inherited genetic autism."
"Summary of Juvenile spondyloarthropathy: Juvenile spondyloarthropathy refers to a group of rheumatic diseases that develop during childhood and are characterized by inflammation of the entheses (the regions where tendons or ligaments attach to bones) and joints. The joints of the lower extremities are generally affected first followed by the sacroiliac joints (between the pelvis and the spine) and spinal joints some years later. Signs and symptoms may include pain and swelling of the affected entheses and joints. The underlying cause of Juvenile spondyloarthropathy is currently unknown; however, the condition is strongly associated with HLA-B27. Some cases appear to occur sporadically while other affected people have a family history of arthritis, or other related condition."
Summary of IRF6-Related disorders: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of X-linked hypophosphatemia: X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is an inherited disorder characterized by low levels of phosphate in the blood. Phosphate levels are low because phosphate is abnormally processed in the kidneys, which causes a loss of phosphate in the urine (phosphate wasting) and leads to soft, weak bones (rickets). XLH is usually diagnosed in childhood. Features include bowed or bent legs, short stature, bone pain, and severe dental pain. XLH is caused by genetic changes in the PHEX gene on the X chromosome, and inheritance is X-linked dominant."
"Summary of C1q deficiency: C1q deficiency is a rare disorder associated with recurrent skin lesions, chronic infections, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or SLE-like diseases. It has also been associated with a kidney disease known as mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. C1q is a protein and together with other proteins, C1r and C1s, it forms the C1 complex. This complex is important for the activation of the complement system (a group of proteins that work with the immune system). It also disposes cells that are dead. C1q deficiency presents in 2 different forms, absent C1q protein or abnormal C1q protein. Symptoms include infections (ear infections (otitis media), meningitis, urinary tract infections, oral infections); skin lesions (small blisters (vesicles), dark patches, and atrophic areas) that get worse upon light exposure; cataracts; loss of eyelashes, eyebrows, and scalp hair; blood in urine; and glomerulonephritis. About 93% of cases are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It can be caused by genetic changes in the C1QA, C1QB or C1QC genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Primary orthostatic hypotension: Primary orthostatic hypotension is a rare type of orthostatic hypotension. It is not a disease per se, but a condition caused by several disorders that affect a specific part of the autonomic nervous system, such as multiple system atrophy, young-onset Parkinson's disease, pure autonomic failure, dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, familial dysautonomia, and pure autonomic failure among others. The autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that regulates certain involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder control. Orthostatic hypotension is a form of low blood pressure that happens when standing-up from sitting or lying down. Common symptoms may include dizziness, lightheadedness, generalized weakness, leg buckling, nausea, blurry vision, fatigue, and headaches. Additional symptoms can include chest pain (angina), head and neck pain (often affecting neck and shoulders with a coat hanger distribution), decline in cognitive functioning such as difficulty concentrating, temporary loss of consciousness or 'blackout'. Some people with Primary orthostatic hypotension may also have high blood pressure when lying down."
"Summary of MEGDEL syndrome: MEGDEL syndrome is a rare, genetic, neurometabolic disorder characterized by neonatal hypoglycemia, features of sepsis that are not linked to infection, development of feeding problems, failure to thrive, transient liver dysfunction, and truncal hypotonia followed by dystonia and spasticity which results in psychomotor development arrest and/or regression. Progressive sensorineural deafness, intellectual disability and absent speech are also associated. Laboratory tests demonstrate 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and temporary elevated serum lactate and transaminases."
"Summary of Dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia: 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria type V is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the onset of dilated or noncompaction cardiomyopathy in infancy or early childhood. Many patients die of cardiac failure. Other features include microcytic anemia, growth retardation, mild ataxia, mild muscle weakness, genital anomalies in males, and increased urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid. Some patients may have optic atrophy or delayed psychomotor development (summary by Davey et al., 2006 and Ojala et al., 2012).For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, see MGCA type I (250950)."
Summary of TMEM70 defect: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Reticulohistiocytoma: Reticulohistiocytoma (RH) is a rare benign lesion of the soft tissue. It belongs to a group of disorders called non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis and is a type of reticulohistiocytosis, all of which are types of histiocytosis. Histiocytosis is a condition in which there is rapid production (proliferation) of histiocytes (immune cells) in the skin or soft tissues. The stimulus that causes the immune system to react in RH is currently not well understood. RH present as a yellow to reddish-brown smooth surfaced, firm nodule or lesion on the trunk and/or extremities of the body. Historically, RH has been found in young adults, with a slightly higher incidence in males."
"Summary of Madelung deformity: Madelung deformity (MD) is a rare congenital (present from birth) condition in which the wrist grows abnormally and part of the radius, one of the bones of the forearms, stops growing early and is short and bowed. The other forearm bone, the ulna, keeps growing and can dislocate, forming a bump. It is more commonly observed in females. Symptoms include a decreased range of motion in the wrist, pain, and a visible difference in the appearance of the wrist. In addition to the abnormal growth, there is also an abnormal palmar (Vickers' ligament) that is thought to contribute to the deformity. MD seems to be caused by a combination of both genetic and acquired factors (such as following a trauma or overuse of the joint). MD can also occur as part of another conditions. Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis, characterized by bilateral Madelung deformity and short stature with short arms and legs, is caused by genetic changes or losses of genetic material involving the SHOX gene. Some cases of isolated MD may be caused by alterations in the SHOX gene."
Summary of Lipedematous Scalp: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases: Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) is a rare immunodeficiency syndrome, with susceptibility to mycobacteria, such as the vaccine against tuberculosis (bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and environmental mycobacteria. It is characterized by severe, recurrent infections, either systemic (widespread) or localized. The most serious types are the autosomal recessive complete interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFN-gammaR1) and receptor 2 (IFN-gammaR2) deficiencies. Only about half of patients with MSMD have an identified genetic cause. Nine genes are known to be responsible for MSMD. Seven of them are inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant pattern (IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT1, IL12B, IL12RB1, IRF8 and ISG15 genes) and 2 are X-linked (IKBKG and CYBB genes)."
"Summary of Proximal myopathy with extrapyramidal signs: Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs is a disorder characterized by early childhood onset of proximal muscle weakness (muscles closest to the body's midline) and learning disabilities. The muscle weakness does not progress, but most patients develop progressive atypical involuntary muscle contractions that influence gait, movement, and posture (extrapyramidal signs) that may be disabling. Signs and symptoms are variable and include brief, repetitive, jerky and uncontrolled movements caused by muscle contractions (chorea), tremor, abnormal posturing, and involuntary repetitive movements of the mouth and face. Other symptoms may include uncoordinated movements (ataxia), a very small head (microcephaly), drooping of the eyelids, wasting of the eye nerve (optic atrophy), and axonal peripheral neuropathy. It is caused by changes in the MICU1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome: Monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS) is a rare immunological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of allergy, flushing, stomach and intestinal cramping, diarrhea, wheezing, fatigue and a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a fall in blood pressure (hypotension). MMAS is very similar to systemic mastocytosis but without the itchy skin patches known as urticaria pigmentosa. Symptoms may be triggered by a number of factors, including eating, exertion, environmental conditions, emotional stress, or insect stings. It is caused by a very small change in the KIT gene which results in a defect of the mast cells."
"Summary of Mast cell activation syndrome: Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) causes a person to have repeated severe allergy symptoms affecting several body systems. In MCAS, mast cells mistakenly release too many chemical agents, resulting in symptoms in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, heart, respiratory, and neurologic systems. Mast cells are present throughout most of our bodies and secrete different chemicals during allergic reactions. Symptoms include episodes of abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, flushing, itching, wheezing, coughing, lightheadedness and rapid pulse and low blood pressure. Symptoms can start at any age, but usually begin in adulthood. The cause of MCAS is unknown. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and specific laboratory testing. Other conditions may need to be excluded before MCAS can be diagnosed."
"Summary of Hereditary folate malabsorption: Hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM) is an inherited disorder of folate transport characterized by a systemic and central nervous system (CNS) folate deficiency manifesting as megaloblastic anemia, failure to thrive, diarrhea and/or oral mucositis, immunologic dysfunction and neurological disorders."
"Summary of Aquagenic palmoplantar keratoderma: Aquagenic palmoplantar keratoderma is a rare condition affecting the palms of the hands. It is characterized by the appearance or worsening of a palmar eruption, following brief exposure to water. The palmar eruption is made up of small, white or shining pimples that can conjoin into plaques. The feet are unaffected. Symptoms include a burning pain and a tightening sensation in the palms, as well as too much sweating. There are two variants. Most commonly, it is a temporary and recurrent condition that appears after submersion in water, known as the 'hand in the bucket sign,' that gets better within minutes to hours of drying. A less common variant is characterized by persistent lesions that are worsened after water submersion. The cause of aquagenic palmoplantar keratoderma is unknown, but likely relates to sweating. Several studies have found that it is present in about 40% to 84% of cystic fibrosis patients and also in carriers, which suggest that it may be caused by genetic changes in the CFTR gene. It is more often found in young women. Besides cystic fibrosis, it is also seen in wasting (marasmus) and nephrotic syndrome and also with the use of aspirin and other drugs such as rofecoxib and celecoxib."
Summary of Craniofacial microsomia: This section is currently in development.
Summary of SCN1A-related seizure disorders: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome: MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome is a genetic syndrome that causes intellectual disability, speech problems, and behavioral problems. People with the syndrome usually have distinctive facial features, such as eyes that slant upwards, a flat nasal bridge with a bulb-like tip, very small chin (micrognathia), large and lowset ears, and broad forehead. Most children with the syndrome have poor muscle tone (hypotonia) and may take longer to learn to sit and walk independently (delayed motor skills). Some babies with MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome are born with heart defects, which may be mild or severe. Other features may include short stature, cleft palate, problems with coordination (ataxia), and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome is caused by changes (pathogenic variants, also called genetic changes) in the MED13L gene. Diagnosis may be suspected due to distinctive facial features, speech delay, and intellectual disability, but must be confirmed by genetic testing."
"Summary of Lupus erythematosus tumidus: Tumid erythematosus lupus is considered a rare type of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) can be divided into acute cutaneous lupus, subacute cutaneous lupus, and chronic cutaneous lupus. Tumid erythematosus lupus is characterized by smooth, non-scarring, pink- to violet-colored pimples (papules) on the skin without any other apparent skin changes, such as scarring. Patients with tumid lupus erythematosus usually do not have other symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus or other types of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The papules appear on sun-exposed areas of the face, upper back, V area of the neck, trunk, and arms, and more rarely on thighs and legs. They usually affect equally both sides of the body, but may affect only one side. Normally, the papules clear without leaving scars."
"Summary of Hepatic veno-occlusive disease: A disorder characterized by damage of the hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells of the hepatic venules that leads to venular occlusion and hepatocellular necrosis. It is usually the side effect of high dose chemotherapy in preparation for stem cell transplantation. Less frequently it may be caused by ingestion of plant alkaloids. The clinical signs and symptoms include hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, and fluid retention."
"Summary of Hemoglobin M disease: A rare hemoglobinopathy characterized by the presence of hemoglobin variants with structural abnormalities in the globin portion of the molecule which lead to auto-oxidation of heme iron, resulting in methemoglobinemia. Patients present with cyanosis for which no treatment is necessary. Mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a group of diseases (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis), characterized by destruction and inflammation of small vessels. The clinical signs vary and affect several organs, such as the kidney, stomach, intestine, and lung. Skin lesions, such as purpura and urticaria, result when blood from small vessels leaks under the skin. AAV occurs when neutrophils attack small and medium vessels of the body. The underlying reason for this remains unclear."
Summary of Elizabethkingia anophelis infection: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Obesity due to congenital leptin deficiency: Leptin deficiency is characterized by severe early-onset obesity, hyperphagia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and neuroendocrine/metabolic dysfunction (Ozata et al., 1999)."
"Summary of Immune dysregulation-inflammatory bowel disease-arthritis-recurrent infections s: Immune dysregulation-inflammatory bowel disease-arthritis-recurrent infections syndrome is a rare disease that affects the immune system. It begins during infancy and can cause severe and progressive inflammatory bowel disease with ulcers and fistulas (abnormal openings) around the anus. People with this disease may also get infections in their respiratory system, urinary system, and skin. They may also develop arthritis, which can cause joint pain and stiffness. This disease can increase the risk of developing B-cell lymphoma, a type of cancer."
Summary of 10q22.3q23 microdeletion syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Mitochondrial short-chain enoyl-coa hydratase 1 deficiency: Mitochondrial short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 deficiency is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by delayed psychomotor development, neurological degeneration, increased lactic acid, and brain lesions in structures of the brain known as the basal ganglia. It is one subtype of Leigh-Like syndrome. Only a few cases have being reported. Symptoms may include delayed motor and speech development, hearing problems, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), poor suck, and sporadic lack of breath (apnea). Other symptoms reported include abnormal eye movements (nystagmus), heart defects, brain anomalies, and abnormal movements. This condition is caused by genetic changes in the ECHS1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Microcystic lymphatic malformation: Microcystic lymphatic malformation is one subtype of lymphatic malformation (LM), a congenital malformation of the lymphatic vessels in soft tissues, including the skin. LM is classified into the macrocystic type, cysts larger than 2 cm with clear margins (previously known as cystic hygromas), and the microcystic type, consisting of cysts smaller than 2 cm, that appear diffuse, and grow without clear borders (previously known as lymphangioma circumscriptum). When the two types concur it is called the combined type. Microcystic lesions are commonly found inside the mouth, throat, and in the tongue, parotid gland and submandibular gland. Symptoms include deformity, and problems with breathing and feeding. The exact cause is unknown but is likely related to a malformation of the lymphatic system at six to ten weeks of gestation, when some lymphatic tissue fails to communicate with the lymphatic and venous system."
Summary of Alezzandrini syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Woolly hair nevus: A woolly hair nevus (epidermal nevus) is a noncancerous (benign) patch of skin caused by an overgrowth of skin cells. The nevi (plural form of nevus) are seen at birth or develop in early childhood. They can be flat, tan patches of skin, or raised, velvety patches and may become thicker and darker and develop a wart-like (verrucous) appearance. Often, woolly hair nevi follow a pattern on the skin known as the 'lines of Blaschko'. Sometimes, people with a woolly hair nevus may have problems in other body systems, such as the brain, eyes, or bones; these people are said to have an woolly hair nevus syndrome, which is a group of different disorders. Genetic changes associated with a woolly hair nevus are present only in the cells of the nevus, not in the normal skin cells surrounding it, and may involve the FGFR3, PIK3CA or, HRAS genes."

Summary of Dissociative seizures: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Episodic angioedema with eosinophilia: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Deafness-lymphedema-leukemia syndrome: Deafness-lymphedema-leukemia syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by swelling (lymphedema), a weak immune system (immunodeficiency), and blood disorders. Signs and symptoms may include congenital deafness, swelling of the legs and genitalia, a type of cancer known as acute myeloblastic leukemia, reduction of the blood cells (pancitopenia), scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), heart problems and cerebellar atrophy (volume loss of the cerebellum which is part of the brain). Patients may also have closely spaced eyes (hypotelorism), skin folds in the inner corner of the eyes, long tapering fingers and/or neck webbing, recurrent infections in the swelled legs, and many warts. It is caused by a genetic change in the GATA2 gene and it is inherited in an autosomal dominant way."
"Summary of Cortical dysgenesis with pontocerebellar hypoplasia due to TUBB3 mutation: Cortical dysgenesis with pontocerebellar hypoplasia due to TUBB3 mutation is a rare genetic disease that affects the brain. It is caused by abnormal neuronal migration, which means that the brain cells do not move to the right place during development. This causes cortical dysplasia and pontocerebellar hypoplasia which means the folds in the outer layer of the brain, called the cortex, and the part of the brain that controls balance and coordination do not develop properly. Together, this can cause global developmental delay, intellectual disability, diffculty sitting up due to trunk weakness (axial hypotonia), misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), rapid uncontrollable movement of the eyes (nystagmus), and occasionally underdevelopment or absence of the optic nerve (optic nerve hypoplasia). Brain imaging can reveal a variety of malformations."
"Summary of Neuroendocrine tumor of pancreas: A Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, also called an islet cell tumor, is a type of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) that typically arises in the pancreas. However in some cases, a pancreatic NET occurs outside of the pancreas. A NET arises from cells that produce hormones, so the tumor can also produce hormones. It may be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Pancreatic NETs are called either functional or nonfunctional. A functional pancreatic NET causes specific symptoms because it makes extra hormones, such as gastrin, insulin, or glucagon. Examples of types of functional pancreatic NETs include insulinomas, glucagonomas, gastrinomas, VIPomas, and somatostatinomas. Symptoms depend on the type of hormone being made. A nonfunctional pancreatic NET generally does not cause specific symptoms, but may eventually cause symptoms relating to its location and size as it grows or spreads. Most pancreatic NETs are not inherited and occur sporadically in people with no family history of NETs. However, about 10% are associated with a hereditary cancer or tumor syndrome such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), which has autosomal dominant inheritance."
"Summary of Necrobiosis lipoidica: Necrobiosis lipoidica is a rare skin disorder of collagen degeneration. It is characterized by a rash that occurs on the lower legs. It is more common in women, and there are usually several spots. They are slightly raised shiny red-brown patches. The centers are often yellowish and may develop open sores that are slow to heal. Infections can occur but are uncommon. Some patients have itching, pain, or abnormal sensations. It usually occurs more often in people with diabetes, in people with a family history of diabetes or a tendency to get diabetes, but can occur in nondiabetic people. About 11% to 65% of patients with Necrobiosis lipoidica also have diabetes, but the exact cause is still not known."
"Summary of Thrombophilia due to protein c deficiency, autosomal recessive: Thrombophilia due to protein c deficiency, autosomal recessive is an inherited blood clotting disorder characterized by serious protein C deficiency. The disease may be very severe and associated with neonatal purpura fulminans (NPF) or intracranial thromboembolism. It may also be a milder disorder where patients present with clotting (venous thromboembolism) in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. It is caused by having changes in the PROC gene. The inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Multicentric carpotarsal osteolysis syndrome: Multicentric carpotarsal osteolysis syndrome is a very rare condition characterized by progressive loss of some of the bones of the hand and feet, usually the carpal (bones of the wrist) and tarsal bones (bones of the ankle), as well as chronic kidney (renal) failure in many cases. The bone problems lead to deformity and disability. Some patients also have intellectual disability and facial abnormalities. It is caused by genetic changes in the MAFB gene. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been described in many families but most cases are sporadic."
"Summary of Intellectual disability-craniofacial dysmorphism-cryptorchidism syndrome: Intellectual disability-craniofacial dysmorphism-cryptorchidism syndrome, also known as PACS-1 related syndrome, causes intellectual disability, developmental delay, and distinctive facial features. This condition is present from birth. Symptoms of PACS-1 related syndrome may include low muscle tone, feeding difficulties, constipation, seizures, and heart defects. PACS1-related syndrome is caused by a specific genetic variant in the PACS1 gene. In most cases, this gene variant is not inherited, but occurs as a new change during the making of the egg or the sperm. The diagnosis is based on the symptoms, a clinical examination, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing. As of 2017, less than 70 people have been diagnosed with this syndrome."
Summary of Epidermoid brain cyst: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Giant cell tumor of bone: A benign but locally aggressive tumor that arises from the bone and is composed of mononuclear cells admixed with macrophages and osteoclast-like giant cells. It usually arises from the ends of long bones or the vertebrae. Clinical presentation includes pain, edema, and decreased range of motion in the affected joint."
Summary of Nevus comedonicus: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Congenital analbuminemia: Congenital analbuminemia (CAA) is a rare disorder characterized by the absence or very low levels of human serum albumin (HSA). Although albumin is the most abundant plasma protein and has many functions, patients with CAA present with only a few mild clinical signs, such as fatigue, low blood pressure, and swelling (edema). However, CAA patients may loss fat tissue (lipodystrophy) and present with high cholesterol, which may result in early atherosclerosis and heart problems. Rarely, CAA may be complicated by hypercoagulability (when the blood tends to clot too much), osteoporosis (which causes bones to become weak and brittle) and respiratory tract infections. It is more severe in the fetus or during early infancy. CAA is caused by genetic changes in the ALB gene. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
Summary of KCNQ2-related epileptic encephalopathy: KCNQ2-Related Disorders are a group of epileptic diseases that start during the first 4 weeks of a child's life (neonatal period). The groups is made up of various different diseases whose signs and symptoms vary. The conditions range from the less severe form KCNQ2-related benign familial neonatal epilepsy (KCNQ2-BFNE) to the more severe form KCNQ2-related epileptic encephalopathy (KCNQ2-NEE). KCNQ2-BFNE is characterized by seizures that start in otherwise healthy infants around day 3 of life and usually go away within 1 to 4 months. These disorders are caused by genetic changes in the KCNQ2 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant.
"Summary of Bockenheimer syndrome: Bockenheimer syndrome is a very rare condition characterized by an extensive venous malformation involving all veins, including the smallest ones, on the arms and legs. It is present at birth (congenital) and is progressive during life. The venous dilatation can be seen beneath the skin on the arms and legs. It is more common on a single arm and hand but may occur on both sides. The involved arm or leg may be thicker than the normal one. Pain, swelling, muscle wasting, and ulceration can occur. The cause is unknown."
"Summary of Lewis-Sumner syndrome: Lewis-Sumner syndrome (also known as multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy) is a neurological condition affecting primarily the arms and hands (upper limbs). The symptoms are a result of inflammation of the nerves leading to the upper body and the destruction of the fatty covering that protects the nerves (myelin sheath). Lewis Sumner syndrome is an acquired disorder, and the exact cause of the condition is not known. Lewis Sumner syndrome may be difficult to distinguish from other forms of demyelinating neuropathies, but diagnosis may be possible through nerve conduction studies or a specific type of imaging test, called MRI with T2 STIR."
"Summary of Primary hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia: Familial hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia is a disease characterized by very low magnesium levels in the blood. The disease begins during the first months of life with generalized and recurrent seizures which do not improve with usual treatment. Additional features include tetany (spasms of the hands and feet, cramps, spasm of the voice box (larynx), and overactive neurological reflexes), failure to thrive, restlessness, tremors, muscle spasms, and bluish skin around the mouth (perioral cyanosis). Abnormal heart rhythm (cardiac arrhythmia) may be observed. The low levels of magnesium result in low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and in low levels of calcium in the bloods (hypocalcemia). It is caused by genetic changes in the TRPM6 gene. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Nevus comedonicus syndrome: Nevus comedonicus (NC) is a rare type of epidermal nevus with predilection for the face and neck area. The condition develops within the first decade of life in most patients. NC is characterized by dilated, plugged follicular ostia containing lamellar keratinaceous material and grouped in a honeycomb pattern; the distribution of lesions may be unilateral, bilateral, linear, interrupted, segmental, or along the lines of Blaschko. NC may be nonpyogenic with an acne-like appearance or associated with the formation of cysts, papules, pustules, and abscesses. Histologically, the lesions are large, grouped, dilated follicular ostia devoid of hair shafts but filled with keratin layers (summary by Tchernev et al., 2013)."
Summary of Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma: A neuroglial tumor that arises from the middle portion of the brain stem. It usually affects children and has a poor prognosis.
"Summary of Telangiectasia macularis eruptive perstans: Telangiectasia macularis eruptive perstans (TMEP) is a very rare skin disease. The lesions of TMEP typically appear as small, irregular red spots and brown widened blood vessels on the skin (telangiectasia) mostly located on the trunk, legs, and arms in a symmetrical pattern. The palms, soles and face are spared in most cases. In most cases, the lesions are not itchy and do not form blisters. Rarely, there are other symptoms in other parts of the body. Diagnosis is usually based on the features, and confirmed by a skin biopsy."
"Summary of Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 13: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 13 (also known as SCN8A encephalopathy) is a very rare form of early-onset epilepsy that causes multiple types of seizures and developmental delay or regression (loss of skills). Types of seizures may include generalized tonic-clonic seizures, infantile spasms, absence seizures, and focal seizures. Other signs and symptoms of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 13 may include low muscle tone (hypotonia), a high pain tolerance, movement disorders (such as dystonia and ataxia), mild to severe intellectual disability, sleep problems, and autistic-like features. In some people with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 13, various other medical problems have been reported including hearing or vision problems, scoliosis, and difficulty regulating body temperature. Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 13 is caused by genetic changes in the SCN8A gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, but most people with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 13 have a new genetic change in the gene that was not inherited from a parent."
Summary of Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Small Intestinal Adenocarcinoma: Small intestine adenocarcinoma is one type of small bowel cancer, usually occurring in the duodenum or jejunum, that begins in the gland cells. The small intestine is part of the body's digestive system, which also includes the esophagus, stomach, and large intestine. The exact cause is still unknown, but it may be due to DNA changes in the small intestine adenocarcinoma cells. The symptoms of small bowel tumors are often vague. The most common symptoms are pain in the belly (which may be the first symptom), weight loss, weakness, fatigue and low red blood cell counts (anemia)."
"Summary of OPHN1 syndrome: OPHN1 syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by intellectual disability and changes in the part of the brain which controls movement and balance (cerebellum). The syndrome mainly affects males. Signs and symptoms may include intellectual disability, low muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental and cognitive delay, early-onset seizures, abnormal behavior, small or underdeveloped genitals, characteristic facial features (long face, bulging forehead, under eye creases, deep set eyes, and large ears), crossed eyes (strabismus) and inability to coordinate movements. A small cerebellum and large brain ventricles can be seen on brain imaging (MRI). OPHN1 syndrome is caused by genetic changes in the OPHN1 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Inheritance is X-linked. Some females who carry a genetic change in the OPHN1 gene may have mild learning disabilities, mild cognitive impairment, strabismus, and subtle facial changes."
"Summary of Corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency: Corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency is a genetic disorder characterized by extreme tiredness (fatigue), particularly after physical exertion, and low blood pressure (hypotension). Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) is a protein primarily produced in the liver that attaches to cortisol, a hormone with numerous functions, including maintaining blood sugar levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. When cortisol is needed in the body, CBG delivers the cortisol where it is needed and releases it. Signs and symptoms of CBG deficiency vary. While some individuals may experience no symptoms, others are found to have a fatty liver and chronic pain. Some people with CBG deficiency also have chronic fatigue syndrome. CGB deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the SERPINA6 gene. The SERPINA6 gene is commonly also referred to as the CBG gene. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported."
Summary of Fibro-adipose vascular anomaly: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Dent disease: Dent disease is a chronic kidney disease that primarily affects males. While symptoms and severity vary, they usually begin in childhood and worsen over time. The most common feature of Dent disease is proteinuria (protein in the urine). Other common features include excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria); calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis); and kidney stones. Less common features include rickets and mildy short stature. Progressive kidney problems often lead to kidney failure by early to mid-adulthood. There are two forms of Dent disease which are distinguished based on their genetic causes. Both forms are inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. Dent disease type 1 is caused by a genetic change in the CLCN5 gene. Dent disease type 2 is caused by a genetic change in the OCRL gene. Males with this form are also at increased risk for mild intellectual disability and hypotonia."
Summary of Orofacial Granulomatosis: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Adenosquamous carcinoma of the endometrium: A rare endometrial carcinoma characterized by the presence of both malignant glandular and malignant squamous cellular components.
"Summary of MIRAGE syndrome: MIRAGE syndrome is a condition characterized by Myelodysplasia, Infection, Restriction of growth, Adrenal hypoplasia, Genital problems, and Enteropathy (intestinal problems). It was originally described in 11 patients who had growth restriction, intellectual disability, developmental delay, adrenal insufficiency resulting in skin hyperpigmentation, symptoms of salt loss, poorly developed and abnormal genitalia (small penis, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum (cryptorchidism) and the urethral opening in the underside of the penis (hypospadias). All patients had low platelet numbers (thrombocytopenia) and/or anemia. MIRAGE syndrome is caused by a change in the SAMD9 gene."
"Summary of Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus is a type of rare condition called a stiff person syndrome. It affects the body's ability to move. It causes stiffness in the limbs and trunk, spasms that are triggered by certain things, sudden muscle jerks, and problems with the autonomic nervous system (the part of the nervous system responsible for controlling involuntary body functions like the beating of the heart). It can also affect the brainstem and other parts of the nervous system. This condition gets worse over time and can be very dangerous, especially if it affects breathing. It may be linked to certain antibodies in the body (glycine receptor or glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies) or to tumors in the thymus or lymph nodes."
"Summary of Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia type 4: Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia-4 (AOA4) is an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder characterized by onset of dystonia and ataxia in the first decade. Additional features include oculomotor apraxia and peripheral neuropathy. Some patients may show cognitive impairment. The disorder is progressive, and most patients become wheelchair-bound in the second or third decade (summary by Bras et al., 2015).For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of ataxia-oculomotor apraxia, see AOA1 (208920)."
"Summary of Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 3: AOA3 is an autosomal recessive progressive neurologic disorder with onset in the second decade of life (Al Tassan et al., 2012).For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of ataxia-oculomotor apraxia, see AOA1 (208920)."
Summary of Infantile liver failure syndrome 2: Infantile liver failure syndrome-2 is a rare genetic disorder that affects infants and young children. It is caused by a recessive gene and is characterized by episodes of acute liver failure during febrile illnesses. Patients usually recover completely between episodes with conservative treatment. The disease is not contagious and cannot be caught from someone else.
"Summary of Acute infantile liver failure-multisystemic involvement syndrome: Acute infantile liver failure-multisystemic involvement syndrome is a rare genetic disease which affects the liver. It happens in the first year of life and can cause the liver to suddenly stop working. Symptoms include not growing well, weak muscles, delayed development, seizures, abnormal liver function tests, small red blood cells, and high levels of lactate in the blood. Other issues that may develop include fat buildup in the liver, scarring of the liver, changes to the brain structure, and kidney problems (renal tubulopathy). Even minor illnesses can make the liver failure worse."
"Summary of Granulomatous lobular mastitis: Granulomatous lobular mastitis is a rare inflammatory disease of the breast. This disease usually affects women of child-bearing age or those who use oral contraceptive medication. The main symptoms include a palpable mass, skin or nipple retraction, and pain and swelling in the breast. Core needle biopsy is the recommended method for diagnosis and must be made in all cases, to rule-out breast cancer and other causes of granulomatous mastitis (such as infections (bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial), sarcoidosis, and other systemic granulomatous diseases). After ruling-out these diseases, the diagnosis of idiopathic 'Granulomatous lobular mastitis' is made. The cause is unknown, but may be autoimmune. Some cases are associated with Corynebacterium infection (when it is known as cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis)."
"Summary of Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a unique pulmonary vascular disease caused by chronic block of the major lung arteries. Signs and symptoms commonly include progressive breathing difficulties (dyspnea) on exertion, fatigue, palpitations, loss of consciousness (syncope), or swelling (edema). However, up to 60% of patients have no history of acute pulmonary embolism. Some people with this disease may have clotting problems. Research suggests there may be a genetic predisposition leading to abnormal vascular healing after pulmonary embolism in susceptible individuals, but no specific gene genetic changes have been identified in CTEPH."
"Summary of Hematohidrosis: Hematohidrosis is a rare condition characterized by blood oozing from intact skin and mucosa. Signs and symptoms include sweating blood, crying bloody tears, bleeding from the nose, bleeding from the ears, or oozing blood from other skin surfaces. The episodes are usually self-limiting. In some cases, the fluid appears to be blood tinged, while others resemble frank blood. It can occur on any part of the body, but most commonly appears on the face (ear, nose, and eyes). The cause is unknown. The bleeding is due to the rupture of the very small blood vessels of the skin (dermal capillaries). Some cases are associated with systemic disease, bleeding disorders, menstruation, excessive exertion, high blood pressure, fear and intense emotional stress."
"Summary of Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 30: Autosomal dominant intellectual disability 30 is a rare genetic condition characterized by developmental delay, speech delay, social difficulties and behavioral problems. Other symptoms and features may include aggressive behavior with mood swings in childhood, unusual facial features (wide spaced eyes (hypertelorism), drooping eyelids (ptosis), and a wide mouth), autism spectrum disorder, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), epilepsy, and deafness. One of the few patients described also had a happy disposition and uncoordinated gait (unsteady while walking), as well as eosinophilic esophagitis and multiple allergies. The condition is caused by genetic changes in the ZMYND11 gene. Inheritance seems to be autosomal dominant. The loss of this gene may also cause some of the features in the recently described 10p15.3 microdeletion syndrome."
"Summary of Acute flaccid myelitis: Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a condition that affects the spinal cord leading to muscle weakness and loss of reflexes. Most people who develop AFM have had a viral illness with flu-like symptoms one to four weeks before symptoms of AFM. Symptoms of AFM include sudden onset (acute) of weakness in the arm(s) or leg(s), loss of muscle tone, and decreased or absent reflexes. Other symptoms may include pain, facial weakness, and difficulty swallowing, speaking, or moving the eyes. It is not clear why some people develop AFM and others do not. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, a clinical exam, an MRI of the spine, and other laboratory testing. Most people with AFM continue to have muscle weakness for months to years. Sometimes the muscles involved with breathing become weakened, and ventilator support is necessary to help with breathing."
Summary of Tibial muscular dystrophy: Tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) is a specific type of distal myopathy. Distal myopathies affect the muscles farthest from the center of the body. TMD is characterized by weakness of the muscles in the front of the lower legs. It typically appears between the ages of 40 and 70.
"Summary of Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata: Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) is a type of peroxisomal disorder which impairs the normal development of many parts of the body. It is characterized by shortening of the bones in the upper arms and thighs (rhizomelia). People with RCDP have very poor growth and often develop joint deformities (contractures) that make the joints stiff and painful. Other major features include distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts), heart defects, and respiratory problems. There are 5 types of RCDP, classified according to the associated genetic changes: RCDP1 with PEX7 gene RCDP2 with GNPAT gene RCDP3 with AGPS gene RCDP4 (peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 disorder) with FAR1 gene RCDP5 with PEX5 gene   All these genes are involved in the formation and function of sac-like cell structures called peroxisomes that contain enzymes needed to break down many substances, including fatty acids known as plasmalogens. Deficiency of plasmalogen affects bone growth. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia: CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia is a rare bone disorder that affects how bones grow. It causes short stature from before birth. This disorder can lead to dislocation of the knees, hips or elbows, club feet, and difficulty moving large joints. It can also cause a hunched back and sometimes a curved spine. In some cases, it can affect the heart valves, but it does not affect intelligence, vision or hearing."
Summary of Renal medullary carcinoma: Renal medullary carcinoma is a rare kidney cancer that mostly affects young people with African ancestry. The tumor develops in the medulla of the kidney. The first sign is often blood in the urine (hematuria). Patients may also develop flank pain or feel a lump in the abdomen that is usually on the right side of the body. Having sickle cell trait is a risk factor for developing Renal medullary carcinoma.
"Summary of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency: Hypermethioninemia due to S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency (SAHH deficiency) is a muscle disease associated with high blood levels of methionine and creatine kinase (CK). The main symptoms are psychomotor delay, behavioral disorders, severe myopathy, and delayed myelination from birth. Myelin is the layer covering the axons of nerves and plays an important role in nerve impulse conduction. SAHH deficiency is caused by genetic changes in the AHCY gene. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. A methionine-restricted diet, together with creatine supplements, may partly improve the delayed myelination and psychomotor development."
"Summary of Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 43: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 43 (also known as HIVEP2-related intellectual disability) is a neurological disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, and variable physical features. Early symptoms include poor muscle tone (hypotonia) and delays in the development of motor skills like sitting, standing, and walking. Speech is also affected, with many children never talking or saying only a few words. Common physical features include crossed and widely spaced eyes, high forehead, broad nose root, and tapering fingers. Additional less common signs and symptoms may include a very small head (microcephaly), vision problems, constipation, feeding difficulties, seizures and behavioral problems such as autism, attention deficit, defiance, and anxiety. Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 43 is caused by genetic changes in the HIVEP2 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant."
Summary of Syndactyly: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Xanthoma disseminatum: Xanthoma disseminatum is a rare disease that affects multiple areas of the body. It causes yellowish-red or brown bumps on the skin and inside the mouth and nose. Sometimes, it can also affect organs and parts of the brain like the pituitary gland and hypothalamus which release hormones in the body to regulate various body functions. This can cause problems like diabetes insipidus (which makes you very thirsty and causes you to  urinate a lot), difficulty swallowing, breathing problems, hoarseness, and blurry vision."
Summary of Hereditary alpha tryptasemia syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 94: CHD2-related neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (i.e., refractory seizures and cognitive slowing or regression associated with frequent ongoing epileptiform activity). Seizure onset is typically between ages six months and four years. Seizure types typically include drop attacks, myoclonus, and a rapid onset of multiple seizure types associated with generalized spike-wave on EEG, atonic-myoclonic-absence seizures, and clinical photosensitivity. Intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorders are common. To date only 32 individuals with a CHD2-related neurodevelopmental disorder have been reported; thus, better understanding of the phenotypic spectrum of CHD2-related neurodevelopmental disorders is likely to evolve over time."
"Summary of Infantile-onset periodic fever-panniculitis-dermatosis syndrome: Autoinflammation, panniculitis, and dermatosis syndrome (AIPDS) is an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease characterized by neonatal onset of recurrent fever, erythematous rash with painful nodules, painful joints, and lipodystrophy. Additional features may include diarrhea, increased serum C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia in the absence of any infection. Patients exhibit no overt primary immunodeficiency (Damgaard et al., 2016 and Zhou et al., 2016)."
"Summary of Cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly: Cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly (also known as RNAse T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy) is a disorder that affects the brain. People with cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly have neurological problems that become apparent during infancy; the problems generally do not worsen over time (progress). Most affected individuals have severe intellectual disability; muscle stiffness (spasticity); and a delay in developing motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking. Some do not learn to walk, and most do not develop the ability to speak. Other neurological features that can occur in cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly include hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness), seizures, involuntary writhing movements of the hands (athetosis), uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia), and involuntary eye movements (nystagmus). In addition to the neurological problems associated with this disorder, some affected individuals have unusual facial features sometimes described as a ""doll-like face."" The neurological problems in this disorder are caused by abnormalities in the brain. People with this condition have leukoencephalopathy, an abnormality of the brain's white matter that can be detected with medical imaging. White matter consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. In people with cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly, myelin is not made in sufficient amounts during development, leading to patchy white matter abnormalities (lesions) in the brain. In addition, individuals with cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly may have cysts in regions of the brain called the temporal lobes and enlargement of the fluid-filled cavities (ventricles) near the center of the brain. The white matter lesions are primarily concentrated around the cysts and the ventricles. An abnormally small head and brain size (microcephaly) often occurs in this disorder."
"Summary of Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, encephalomyopathic form with renal tubulop: Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, encephalomyopathic form with renal tubulopathy is a rare mitochondrial disorder that affects many parts of the body. Mitochondrial disorders occur when the structures that produce energy for our cells malfunction. This disease usually starts in newborns or infants and can cause weak muscles, slow growth, lactic acid buildup, and developmental delays. The disease can be severe and lead to breathing and digestive problems that may be fatal in infancy. Some babies with the disease may have milder symptoms and live into childhood. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, small head size, seizures, vision problems, and kidney problems."
"Summary of Hyperammonemic encephalopathy due to carbonic anhydrase VA deficiency: The four children with carbonic anhydrase VA (CA-VA) deficiency reported to date presented between day two of life and age 20 months with hyperammonemic encephalopathy (i.e., lethargy, feeding intolerance, weight loss, tachypnea, seizures, and coma). Data on long-term follow up are limited (the oldest known patient is age 7 years). Two of the four children showed normal psychomotor development and two showed mild learning difficulties and delayed motor skills. Seven additional children diagnosed with CA-VA deficiency (but not yet published) presented similarly."
"Summary of Neurodegeneration due to 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase deficiency: Neurodegeneration due to 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase deficiency, also known as HIBCH deficiency, is a rare metabolic disease. Early symptoms include poor muscle tone, poor feeding, seizures, and a gradual loss of skills. HIBCH deficiency can cause signs and symptoms similar to another disease, called Leigh syndrome. Diagnosis is aided by blood tests which show high levels of lactic acid, and imaging studies which show changes in the """"globi pallidi"""" structure of the brain. HIBCH deficiency occurs when a person inherits a genetic change in both copies of their HIBCH gene. This pattern of inheritance is called """"autosomal recessive."""" The HIBCH gene tells the body how to make an enzyme called 3-hyroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase. When the body does not have enough working enzyme, it can not break down the amino acid valine. As a result, toxic valine metabolites build up in the body. More specifically, these toxic metabolites build up within the mitochondria of the body's cells."
"Summary of 2q32q33 microdeletion syndrome: 2q32q33 microdeletion syndrome is a rare genetic condition presenting at birth. It is caused by a missing piece of genetic material in a chromosome. People with this condition have a range of symptoms. These include moderate to severe intellectual disability and behavior issues. People with this condition may be shorter than usual and have a smaller than usual head size (microcephaly). Symptoms may also include atypical nails and decreased hair growth. 2q32q33 microdeletion syndrome may also cause a split in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), and atypical facial features."
Summary of Hypertrophic olivary degeneration: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Pituitary stalk interruption syndrome: Pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS) is a congenital abnormality of the pituitary gland characterized by the triad of a very thin or interrupted pituitary stalk, a misplaced (ectopic) or absent posterior pituitary and a small or absent anterior pituitary, with permanent growth hormone (GH) deficit. Signs and symptoms in newborns include low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia), jaundice, congenital abnormalities and small penis (micropenis) and/or testis that are not in the scrotal sac (cryptorchidism). Later in childhood, signs may include short stature, seizures, low arterial pressure (hypotension) and/or intellectual delay. Some people can also have vision problems (septooptic dysplasia) and Fanconi anemia. The cause of this condition is unknown. Rare genetic changes in the HESX1, LHX4, OTX2, SOX3, and PROKR2 genes can be the cause in familial cases. The diagnosis is confirmed through MRI showing the characteristic findings."
"Summary of Renal cell carcinoma: Hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma is characterized by the development of multiple, bilateral papillary renal tumors (Zbar et al., 1995). The transmission pattern is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance.Papillary renal cell carcinoma is histologically and genetically distinct from 2 other forms of inherited renal carcinoma, von Hippel Lindau disease (193300), caused by mutation in the VHL gene (608537) on chromosome 3, and a form associated with the chromosome translocation t(3;8), as described by Cohen et al. (1979). Bodmer et al. (2002) reviewed the molecular genetics of familial and nonfamilial cases of renal cell carcinoma, including the roles of VHL, MET, and translocations involving chromosomes 1, 3, and X.For background information and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma, see RCC (144700).See also a hereditary syndrome of predisposition to uterine leiomyomas and papillary renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC; 150800) caused by germline mutation in the FH gene (136850)."
"Summary of Hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma-tendon contractures-myopathy-pulmonary fibrosi: Hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary fibrosis (POIKTMP) is characterized by the skin findings of poikiloderma (typically beginning in the first six months and mainly localized to the face), hypohidrosis with heat intolerance, mild lymphedema of the extremities, chronic erythematous and scaly skin lesions on the extremities, sclerosis of the digits, and mild palmoplantar keratoderma. Scalp hair, eyelashes, and/or eyebrows are typically sparse. Muscle contractures are usually seen in childhood and can be present as early as age two years. The majority of affected individuals develop progressive weakness of the proximal and distal muscles of all four limbs. Some adults develop progressive interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which can be life-threatening within three to four years after respiratory symptoms appear. Other features are exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, liver impairment, hematologic abnormalities, relative short stature, and cataract."
"Summary of BAP1-related tumor predisposition syndrome: BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1-TPDS) is associated with an increased risk for the specific skin lesion â atypical Spitz tumors â and the following cancers, in descending order of frequency: uveal (eye) melanoma (UM), malignant mesothelioma (MMe), cutaneous melanoma (CM), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Affected individuals can have more than one type of primary cancer. In general the median age of onset of these tumors is younger than in the general population. UM tends to be a more aggressive class 2 tumor with higher risk for metastasis and reduced survival compared to UM that occurs in the general population. However, because of the limited number of families reported to date, the penetrance, natural history, and frequencies of the BAP1-associated tumors are yet to be determined. Other suspected but unconfirmed tumors in BAP1-TPDS include (in alphabetic order): breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLC), meningioma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma."
"Summary of Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 11: Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 11 (LCCS11) is a severe disorder characterized by congenital (present at birth) contractures. A contracture is a condition in which a joint becomes permanently fixed in a bent or straightened position, partially or completely restricting the movement of the affected joint. The condition has only being described in few people. Symptoms include flexion and extension contractures of the upper and lower limbs, very small lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), a small and recessed lower jaw (retrognathia), bent toes and fingers (camptodactyly), and bilateral clubfoot. The disease is very severe and most affected infants die soon after birth due to respiratory complications. Ultrasound examination done during the prenatal period may show a fetus that does not move. Lethal congenital contracture arthrogryposis 11 is caused by genetic changes in the GLDN gene. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 11 is a subtype of the lethal congenital contracture syndromes, which are classified under the arthrogryposis syndromes. The term arthrogryposis is used to describe multiple congenital contractures that affect two or more different areas of the body."
"Summary of Severe intellectual disability-progressive postnatal microcephaly-midline stereo: Severe intellectual disability-progressive postnatal microcephaly-midline stereotypic hand movements syndrome is a genetic condition that causes intellectual disability and sometimes other physical, neurological, or psychiatric symptoms. People with this condition can have seizures that are often difficult to control with medications. Other symptoms may include motor and language development delay, regression of learning abilities, autistic-like behavior, characteristic hand movements, and behavioral problems. Physical features may include abnormal head shape (plagiocephaly), very small head (microcephaly), reduced muscle tone (hypotonia), and crossed eyes (strabismus). This condition is caused by genetic changes in the IQSEC2 gene, which is located on chromosome X. Depending on the severity of the genetic change, the features can range from only intellectual disability to a syndrome that includes the other symptoms. In general, males are more affected than females. Most cases are not inherited from a parent but are caused by a new (de novo) genetic change. When the condition is inherited, the pattern is called X-linked recessive. Seizure medications such as lamotrigine and rufinamide have been reported to control seizures in some people."
"Summary of BICD2-related autosomal dominant childhood-onset proximal spinal muscular atroph: BICD2-related autosomal dominant childhood-onset proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMALED2) is a rare neurological disease characterized by early-childhood onset of muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue (muscle atrophy), mostly affecting the muscles of the thighs. It is a subtype of the group of diseases known as spinal muscular atrophy. Symptoms include delayed walking, waddling gait, difficulty walking, foot deformities, and loss of some reflexes. Joint contractures are reported frequently, and a few patients present with congenital hip dysplasia. Other symptoms that have being described are an exaggerated curvature of the lower back (hyperlordosis), increased or decreased muscle tone, small chin (micrognathia), respiratory insufficiency, small head (microcephaly), and extra ridges or folds in the brain surface (polymicrogyria). Sensation and cognitive function are normal in most cases. Many patients show evident atrophy of the lower limbs and a very broad upper body, which resembles a bodybuilder-like shape. It is caused by genetic changes in the BICD2 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant."
Summary of Primary bone cancer: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Familial acute necrotizing encephalopathy: Familial acute necrotizing encephalopathy (also known as infection-induced acute encephalopathy 3 or IIAE3) is the susceptibility to recurrent acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE). ANE refers to the brain lesions that develop within days following the onset of an acute viral illness caused by influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza II, human herpes virus 6, coxsackie virus, or an enterovirus. ANE begins within 12 hours to three or four days of the first viral symptoms. Symptoms include fever, cough, congestion, vomiting, and diarrhea in the first few days, followed by neurological problems, such as seizures, hallucinations, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), or abnormal muscle tone. Most affected individuals go into a coma, which usually lasts for a number of weeks. The condition is described as ""acute"" because the episodes of illness are time-limited. It is caused by genetic changes in the RANBP2 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Acute necrotizing encephalopathy: Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare disease characterized by brain damage (encephalopathy) that usually follows an acute febrile disease, mostly viral infections.. Most of the reported cases are from previously healthy Japanese and Taiwanese children, but it is now known that the disease may affect anybody in the world. The symptoms of the viral infection (fever, respiratory infection, and gastroenteritis, among others) are followed by seizures, disturbance of consciousness that may rapidly progress to a coma, liver problems, and neurological deficits. The disease is caused by both environmental factors and genetic factors. Usually, ANE develops secondary to viral infections, among which the influenza A, influenza B, and the human herpes virus 6, are the most common. ANE can be familial or sporadic, but both forms are very similar to each other. Most familial cases are caused by genetic changes in the RANBP2 gene, and are known as 'infection-induced acute encephalopathy 3 (IIAE3)'. A picture of the brain may help you better visualize the areas of the brain affected."
"Summary of Microphthalmia, syndromic 12: Syndromic microphthalmia-12 is a genetic syndrome with the main features of small eyeballs (microphthalmia), lungs that are too small (pulmonary hypoplasia), and a defect or hole in the diaphragm that allows the abdominal contents to move into the chest cavity (diaphragmatic hernia). People with this syndrome also have progressive movement disorders that cause severe global developmental delay. These movement disorders include spasticity and/or dystonia, with or without abnormal quick movements that resemble dancing (chorea). Within the brain, there can be defects of the cerebellum (Chiari type I malformation) and a build up of cerebrospinal fluid (hydrocephaly). This syndrome causes severe feeding problems and language delay. Facial features seen in people with this syndrome include a broad nose, and a very small chin (micrognathia). Syndromic microphthalmia-12 is caused by genetic changes in the RARB gene."
"Summary of Marginal zone lymphoma: A usually indolent mature B-cell lymphoma, arising from the marginal zone of lymphoid tissues. It is characterized by the presence of small to medium sized atypical lymphocytes. It comprises three entities, according to the anatomic sites involved: extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, which affects extranodal sites (most often stomach, lung, skin, and ocular adnexa); nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, which affects lymph nodes without evidence of extranodal disease; and splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, which affects the spleen and splenic hilar lymph nodes, bone marrow, and often the peripheral blood."

"Summary of X-linked intellectual disability, Cabezas type: X-linked intellectual disability, Cabezas type is a rare genetic condition that affects a person's development and growth. People with this condition may experience delays in reaching developmental milestones, have intellectual disability with severe speech impairment, and are shorter than average. Other symptoms may include affected behavior, difficulty walking, tremors, seizures, hormonal imbalances, obesity, unique facial features, and  small hands and feet. This type of intellectual disability is caused by a gene variant that is passed down on the X chromosome."
Summary of Skeletal-extraskeletal angiomatosis: This section is currently in development.
Summary of IgG4-related pachymeningitis: IgG4-related pachymeningitis is a rare disorder causing inflammation and thickening of the outer layer (dura) of the brain and/or spinal cord. This disease can be widespread or cause tumor-like lesions. IgG4-related pachymeningitis often presents with headache and cranial nerve impairment. Surgery may be recommended for people with advanced or severe IgG4-related pachymeningitis.
"Summary of Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome: Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects a person's ability to learn and grow. People with this syndrome may present with a small head (microcephaly), severe feeding difficulties, and may not grow as quickly as others. They often have severe global developmental delay which may result in speech delays, intellectual disability, and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). People with this disorder usually have a large forehead, thin eyebrows, wide-set eyes, a long nose, and a wide mouth with a full lower lip. They may also have loose joints and wrists that bend inwards."
"Summary of Infantile cerebellar-retinal degeneration: Infantile cerebellar retinal degeneration (ICRD) is a genetic condition present from birth (congenital) that involves the brain and eyes. Individuals with this condition usually develop symptoms around six months of age including developmental delays, low muscle tone (hypotonia), and seizures. Other symptoms may include head bobbing, abnormal muscle twitching and movement, and loss of brain cells in the main part of the brain called the cerebellum. Eye findings in individuals with this condition may include retinal degeneration (weakening of the layer of tissue in the back of the eye that senses light), strabismus (crossed eyes), and nystagmus (fast, uncontrollable movements of the eyes). ICRD is caused by genetic changes in the ACO2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
"Summary of Phosphoserine aminotransferase deficiency, infantile/juvenile form: Deficiency of phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT) is characterized biochemically by low plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of serine and glycine and clinically by intractable seizures, acquired microcephaly, hypertonia, and psychomotor retardation. Outcome is poor once the individual becomes symptomatic, but treatment with serine and glycine supplementation from birth can lead to a normal outcome (Hart et al., 2007)."
Summary of HaNDL syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Bleeding diathesis due to glycoprotein VI deficiency: Bleeding diathesis due to glycoprotein VI deficiency is a rare condition that decreases the body's ability to form blood clots. As a result, affected people may experience frequent nosebleeds and abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding following minor injury or surgery. Women with the condition often have heavy or prolonged menstrual periods. Bleeding diathesis due to glycoprotein VI deficiency can be caused by changes in the GP6 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Some cases appear to be acquired (not caused by inherited genetic changes) and are often associated with autoimmune conditions."
Summary of Ankyrin-B syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Familial focal epilepsy with variable foci: Familial focal epilepsy with variable foci is a rare genetic epilepsy disorder that runs in families. It causes seizures that start in different parts of the brain for different family members. However, for each person, the seizures always start in the same part of the brain. Seizures can be different types and different levels of severity for each family member. They can happen during the day or at night. Some people may have warning signs before a seizure, while others may have repetitive movements during a seizure. Some people may have intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The seizures may become less severe as a person gets older, but they usually don't go away completely."
"Summary of 17q12 microduplication syndrome: 17q12 duplication occurs when a person has an extra copy of a portion of chromosome 17. Our genetic information is organized in structures called chromosomes. People with 17q12 duplication have an extra piece of genetic information from chromosome 17. Some people with this duplication do not have any signs or symptoms. Other people may have symptoms including intellectual disability, developmental delay, and behavioral challenges. Some people with 17q12 duplication may also have vision problems. Rarely, people with 17q12 duplication may also have other health problems, such as problems with the heart or kidneys. 17q12 duplication occurs when a portion of chromosome 17 is duplicated. When the duplication is inherited from a parent, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The duplication may be suspected if a doctor sees signs and symptoms such as developmental delay, behavioral problems, and intellectual disability. Genetic testing using chromosomal microarray (CMA) may confirm the diagnosis."
"Summary of 17q12 microdeletion syndrome: 17q12 deletion syndrome is a chromosome abnormality in which there is a small missing piece (deletion) of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 17. Signs and symptoms can vary widely among people with this syndrome. Other signs and symptoms may include developmental delay, intellectual disability, and behavioral or psychiatric disorders. Some people with 17q12 deletion syndrome have seizures, and/or abnormalities of the eyes, liver, brain, genitalia, or other body systems. 17q12 deletion syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, in most people with this syndrome, the deletion is not inherited from a parent and occurs sporadically. Less commonly, a person with 17q12 deletion syndrome inherits the deletion from a parent. Children of a person with the deletion have a 50% chance of inheriting the deletion."
"Summary of Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, encephalomyopathic form with variable cran: FBXL4-related encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome is a multi-system disorder characterized primarily by congenital or early-onset lactic acidosis and growth failure, feeding difficulty, hypotonia, and developmental delay. Other neurologic manifestations can include seizures, movement disorders, ataxia, autonomic dysfunction, and stroke-like episodes. All affected individuals alive at the time they were reported (median age: 3.5 years) demonstrated significant developmental delay. Other findings can involve the heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart malformations, arrhythmias), liver (mildly elevated transaminases), eyes (cataract, strabismus, nystagmus, optic atrophy), hearing (sensorineural hearing loss), and bone marrow (neutropenia, lymphopenia). Survival varies; the median age of reported deaths was two years (range 2 days - 75 months), although surviving individuals as old as 36 years have been reported. To date FBXL4-related mtDNA depletion syndrome has been reported in 50 individuals."

Summary of Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of MAGEL2-related Prader-Willi-like syndrome: MAGEL2-related Prader-Willi-like syndrome is a genetic condition that affects many parts of the body and is similar to Prader-Willi syndrome. Infants with this syndrome can have low muscle tone (hypotonia), feeding difficulties, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder. They also typically have joint contractures, affecting the finger joints and sometimes the knees and elbows. This syndrome does not usually cause the high appetite seen in people with Prader-Willi syndrome. MAGEL2-related Prader-Willi-like syndrome is caused by a genetic change in the MAGEL2 gene on chromosome 15. This syndrome is related to Prader-Willi syndrome because if MAGEL2 and several additional genes on chromosome 15 are missing or inactivated, then a person will develop Prader-Willi syndrome."
"Summary of Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 12: Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy type 12 (EIEE12) is an extremely rare nervous system disorder. Infants with EIEE12 develop very frequent epileptic seizures. Seizures present within the first days to months of life. Seizures may trigger eye rolling, eyelid fluttering, lip smacking, drooling, bluish coloring around the mouth, limpness, or muscle stiffening (particularly those in his or her back, legs, and arms). EIEE12 occurs when a child inherits two genetic changes in the PLCB1 gene (one from each parent). EIEE12 is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion."
Summary of Condrodisplasia punctata rizomélica: This section is currently in development.
Summary of Familial reactive perforating collagenosis: Familial reactive perforating collagenosis is a rare skin disease can be passed down in families. It causes small bumps or lumps on the skin that can come and go on their own. These bumps are made up of collagen fibers that are pushed out through the skin.
"Summary of Niemann-Pick disease: ""Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) is a group of inherited metabolic disorders in which harmful quantities of a fatty substance (lipids) accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and brain. Symptoms may include lack of muscle coordination, brain degeneration, learning problems, loss of muscle tone, increased sensitivity to touch, spasticity, feeding and swallowing difficulties, slurred speech, and an enlarged liver and spleen. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. Niemann-Pick disease is divided into four main types according to the altered (mutated) gene and the signs and symptoms: Type A, caused by genetic changes in the SMPD1 gene. It is the most severe form, occurs in early infancy and is seen primarily in Jewish families. Type B , caused by genetic changes in the SMPD1 gene. Usually occurs in children, and affects the liver, spleen and lungs (visceral form), but generally does not affect the brain. Type C1, caused by genetic changes in the NPC1 gene. May occur at any age and affect the brain and the viscera. Type C2, caused by homozygous genetic change in the NPC2 gene. Similar to type C1, but more severe, and mostly affecting the lungs. Some classify type A and B as """"acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficiency"""". NP type D is now considered as type C (when affected people are from Nova Scotia, Canada); other rarer types have being described."""
"Summary of BENTA disease: BENTA disease (B cell Expansion with NF-kappaB and T cell Anergy) is a very rare congenital immune deficiency disorder. The main symptoms include spleen enlargement (splenomegalia) and frequent ear, sinus, and lung infections early in life. Some patients can present with molluscum contagiosum or chronic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Blood exams show alterations of several immune cells with very high numbers of polyclonal B cell lymphocytos (above 2200/Î¼l) and few memory B cells. Other findings are low levels of IgM in blood and poor antibody responses to specific vaccines. BENTA disease is caused by genetic changes in the CARD11 gene."
"Summary of Postaxial polydactyly-anterior pituitary anomalies-facial dysmorphism syndrome: Postaxial polydactyly-anterior pituitary anomalies-facial dysmorphism syndrome is a rare disease characterized by pituitary anomalies resulting in hypopituitarism, presence of extra fingers (polydactyly) and unusual facial features. Symptoms related to the hypopituitarism may include abdominal pain, decreased appetite, short stature, delayed bone age, diabetes insipidus, slowed growth and sexual development, undescended testis (cryptorchidism) and small penis (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Facial features include eyes that appear very close together (hypotelorism), cleft palate and cleft lip and a flat nose. The extra digits are usually located on the outside of the little fingers (post-axial polydactyly). Brain imaging may show a small anterior pituitary gland. Postaxial polydactyly-anterior pituitary anomalies-facial dysmorphism syndrome is caused by changes in the GLI2 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Genetic changes in the GLI2 gene can also cause a different condition known as holoprosencephaly-9 (HPE9) which is much more severe. That condition is characterized by a single-lobed brain structure and severe skull and facial defects."
"Summary of Morning glory disc anomaly: ""Morning glory syndrome (MGS) is a birth (congenital) defect of the nerve of the eye (optic nerve) that resembles a flower known as """"morning glory"""". It is characterized by an enlarged, funnel-shaped cavity of the optic disc, the point in the eye where the optic nerve fibers leave the retina. The disc is enlarged and has a white center (giving the appearance of a white pupil). The blood vessels are increased in number and curve as they come from the enlarged disc that have the white center, resulting in this malformation to be similar to petals on a flower. Most reported cases are unilateral (affecting only one eye), sporadic (without other cases in the family), and occur in females. Symptoms include very poor vision in the affected eye with poor visual acuity. MGS may occur by itself or along with other eye abnormalities, such as crossed eyes (strabismus) or lazy eye (amblyopia), or other non-ocular problems like brain disorders.  Typically, individuals with non-ocular  findings also have a wide head, depressed nasal bridge, and mid upper lip defect or cleft. MGS seems to be caused from failure of the optic nerve to completely form when the baby is developing. The most severe complication is retinal detachment, and can occur in about 26-38% of people with MGS. The MGS is sometimes misdiagnosed as an optic nerve coloboma."""
Summary of SCN2A related disorders: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Autosomal recessive intellectual disability 58: Autosomal recessive intellectual disability 58 is a very rare genetic condition characterized by intellectual disability without identified malformations in other organs (non-syndromic) of the body. To date, there are only eight cases reported in the medical literature. Symptoms severity varied in the reported cases, with mild or severe intellectual disability. In one family with two affected brothers, one was not able to walk at age 9 due to progressive spasticity (stiffness or tightness of the muscles with too strong or persistent reflexes) and difficulty talking, and the other never walked or talked. Both brothers had behavioral problems, such as aggressiveness, impulsivity, and self-injury. It is caused by genetic changes in the ELP2 gene. In the reported cases inheritance seems to be autosomal recessive."
"Summary of MAGIC syndrome: MAGIC syndrome is a rare autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by the presence of features of relapsing polychondritis and BehÃ§et's disease in the same individual. It causes inflammation of the cartilage in the e ears, nose, throat, and rib cage. It can also lead to recurrent ulcers in the mouth and genitals. Some patients may also experience eye problems, joint pain, fever, colitis (inflammation of the inner lining of the colon), thrombophlebitis (a swollen vein due to a blood clot), or inflammation of blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord. In some cases, the disease can also cause arterial aneurysms. The symptoms of polychondritis usually occur after the symptoms of BehÃ§et's disease."
"Summary of GATA2 deficiency: GATA2 deficiency is a rare genetic disease that can present as several distinct syndromes: dendritic cell, monocyte, B, and natural killer lymphoid deficiency (monocytopenia and mycobacterial infection syndrome); familial myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML); deafness-lymphedema-leukemia syndrome (Emberger syndrome); or natural killer (NK) cell deficiency. Symptoms are varied and include severe infections (most commonly viral or nontuberculous mycobacterial infections), respiratory problems, hearing loss, leg swelling, and cancer that can appear early in childhood but also later on in life (such as myelodysplasia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia). It is caused by genetic changes in the GATA2 gene, which provides instructions to produce GATA2, a protein that controls when certain genes are 'turned on,' and directs the activity of many types of cells, including immune cells. Genetic changes in the GATA2 gene result in impaired GATA2 protein function leading to GATA2 deficiency. Inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Epiphyseal dysplasia, multiple, 6: Autosomal dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) presents in early childhood, usually with pain in the hips and/or knees after exercise. Affected children complain of fatigue with long-distance walking. Waddling gait may be present. Adult height is either in the lower range of normal or mildly shortened. The limbs are relatively short in comparison to the trunk. Pain and joint deformity progress, resulting in early-onset osteoarthritis, particularly of the large weight-bearing joints."
"Summary of Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 17: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 17 (also known as GNAO1 encephalopathy) is a rare neurologic disorder that causes developmental delay, early infantile seizures, and abnormal movements. Specific symptoms may include seizures that start early in childhood, severe intellectual disability, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), irregular muscle contractions (chorea), and involuntary movements of the face and tongue (dyskinesia). The severity of symptoms can vary. Symptoms may be triggered by strong emotions, illness, and purposeful movements. Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 17 is caused by genetic changes in the GNAO1 gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant."
"Summary of Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 29: Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 29 (also known as SETBP1 disorder) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, mild to moderate developmental delay, autism or autistic traits, and attention deficit. Speech may be absent or delayed. Physical features may include a long face and elongated head (dolichocephaly), eyes that point downwards (downslanting palpebral fissures), and a thin upper lip. Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 29 is caused by a loss-of-function genetic change in one of the two copies of the SETBP1 gene. The SETBP1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 18. Because the features of Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 29 are common, a genetic test (such as whole exome or genome sequencing) may be needed for diagnosis. A different type of genetic change in the SETBP1 gene causes a different and more severe condition called Schinzel Giedion syndrome."
"Summary of Leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate: Leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate (LTBL) is a rare disorder that affects the brain. It is part of a group of disorders known as leukodystrophies. Leukodystrophies are diseases that affect the white matter of the brain. The white matter contains nerve fibers (axons), surrounded by a type of sheath or covering called myelin (a fatty, white colored substance) that allows the transmission of impulses or communication among brain cells (neurons). LTBL is characterized by changes in specific parts of the brain including the cerebellum, thalamus and brainstem. These changes can be seen by brain imaging exams (MRI). High levels of lactate in the blood and in the cerebral spinal fluid are also seen. A severe disease with symptoms that start in newborns and include brain and liver problems. Symptoms generally do not improve with age. LTBL is caused by changes in the EARS2 gene. Genetic changes in this gene decrease the amount of a specific mitochondrial enzyme needed for proper mitochondrial function (mitochondria are cell structures that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use), and therefore, LTBL is also considered a type of mitochondrial disorder. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."
"Summary of Hepatopulmonary syndrome: Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a lung disease characterized by widening of arteries and veins (dilatation) in the lungs in people who have chronic liver disease. Because of the dilated vases, the workload of the heart increases and the blood pumped to the body does not have enough oxygen, leading to a decreased level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia). The normal diameter of the lung vessels ranges between 8 and 15 Î¼m whereas when in HPS rises to between 15 and 500 Î¼m. While many people with HPS don't have any obvious problems, the main reported symptom is shortness of breath (dyspnea) that is worse when standing or sitting up, and is relieved when lying down (platypnea). Symptoms related to chronic liver disease (generally cirrhosis) include small red spots on the skin (spider angiomas) and abnormal vascular dilatations. Some other symptoms that have been described are infections in the brain (brain abscesses), brain bleeding and an increased number of red blood cells in the blood (polycythemia)."
"Summary of Congenital generalized lipodystrophy: Congenital generalized lipodystrophy is a rare disease characterized by a generalized lack of fat (adipose tissue) in the body. It is part of a group of diseases known as lipodystrophies. Signs and symptoms are noticed from birth (congenital) or early childhood and include high levels of fats (triglycerides) in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia) and insulin resistance (in which the body tissues are unable to respond to the hormone insulin that helps to regulate blood sugar levels) resulting in diabetes mellitus, abnormal accumulation of fat in the liver (liver steatosis) and the accumulation of fat in the heart causing a thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), which can lead to a heart that does not work well (heart failure) and sudden death. Due to the almost total absence of fatty tissue and excessive growth of muscle tissue, the patients appear very muscular and have visible and prominent veins. They also have dark and thick skin in the body folds (acanthosis nigricans). There are 4 types of the disease that are distinguished by the altered (mutated) genes and by some additional characteristic symptoms. People with type 1, caused by genetic changes in the AGPAT2 gene, may have cysts in the long bones of the arms and the legs after puberty. In type 2, which is caused by genetic changes in the BSCL2 gene, there may be intellectual disability. In type 3, caused by genetic changes in the CAV1 gene, affected people may have short stature and growth delay. Type 4, caused by genetic changes in the CAVIN1 gene, is associated with muscle weakness, developmental delay, joint anomalies, narrowing of the lower part of the stomach (pyloric stenosis), and severe heart arrhythmia that can lead to sudden death. The inheritance of Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy is autosomal recessive."
"Summary of Lipodystrophy, congenital generalized, type 3: Congenital generalized lipodystrophy, also known as Berardinelli-Seip syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by marked paucity of adipose tissue, extreme insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, and early onset of diabetes (Garg, 2004).For a general description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of congenital generalized lipodystrophy, see CGL1 (608594)."
"Summary of 12q14 microdeletion syndrome: 12q14 microdeletion syndrome is a genetic syndrome caused by a missing piece of chromosome 12. The signs and symptoms depend on the size of the missing piece and the genes involved, but generally include growth delay, short stature and feeding difficulties. When this syndrome is inherited, it is passed on in a dominant pattern. It can be diagnosed through a genetic test, either a chromosomal microarray or whole exome sequencing."
"Summary of 2p15p16.1 microdeletion syndrome: Chromosome 2p16.1-p15 deletion syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, and variable but distinctive dysmorphic features, including microcephaly, bitemporal narrowing, smooth and long philtrum, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal root, thin upper lip, and high palate. Many patients have behavioral disorders, including autistic features, as well as structural brain abnormalities, such as pachygyria or hypoplastic corpus callosum. Those with deletions including the BCL11A gene (606557) also have persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is asymptomatic and does not affected hematologic parameters or susceptibility to infection (summary by Funnell et al., 2015).Point mutation in the BCL11A gene causes intellectual developmental disorder with persistence of fetal hemoglobin (617101), which shows overlapping features.See also fetal hemoglobin quantitative trait locus-5 (HBFQTL5; 142335)."

"Summary of AHDC1-related intellectual disability-obstructive sleep apnea-mild dysmorphism s: AHDC1-related intellectual disability-obstructive sleep apnea-mild dysmorphism syndrome is a rare disorder of intellectual disability. People with this syndrome usually present with developmental delay (especially delays in speech), low muscule tone (hypotonia), failure to thrive, mildly unusual facial features (broad forehead, widely-spaced eyes (hypertelorism), big and low-set ears, flat nasal bridge, and thin upper lip), and breathing difficulties when sleeping (sleep apnea). The sleep apnea may be due to a collapse of the airway when breathing (tracheomalacia). Other signs and symptoms may include autistic features, seizures, lack of coordination (ataxia), behavioral problems, crossed-eyes (strabismus), and an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Males usually have more severe symptoms than females. Brain MRI may show several structural brain defects, such as thinning of the corpus callosum and posterior fossa cysts. AHDC1-related intellectual disability-obstructive sleep apnea-mild dysmorphism syndrome is caused by variants in the AHDC1 gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant but all reported cases to date have been due to new genetic changes (de novo), in individuals with no family history."
"Summary of Neurodevelopmental disorder-craniofacial dysmorphism-cardiac defect-skeletal ano: Neurodevelopmental disorder-craniofacial dysmorphism-cardiac defect-skeletal anomalies syndrome is also known as Au-Kline syndrome. It is a rare genetic condition that presents in newborns. A mutation in the HNRNPK gene has been identified as the cause of this disease. It is characterized by decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). It also causes global developmental delay, and atypical facial features. Some of the facial features include a longer than usual opening between the eyelids. Eye differences also include shallow eye sockets, and drooping upper eyelid (ptosis). Other features include broad nose bridge and underdeveloped outer sides of the nostrils (hypoplastic alae nasi). People with this condition may have downturned corners of the mouth. They may also have a longer than average face. This condition can cause problems with their heart, urinary system, and skeletal system. Some cases have reported other atypical structures in the body, but they vary from case to case. This syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder."
Summary of Rahman syndrome: This section is currently in development.
"Summary of Recurrent metabolic encephalomyopathic crises-rhabdomyolysis-cardiac arrhythmia-: Recurrent metabolic encephalomyopathic crises-rhabdomyolysis-cardiac arrhythmia-intellectual disability syndrome, also known as TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias, is a disease that can cause episodes of metabolic crises and abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia). A metabolic crisis is caused by having low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and the buildup of toxic products in the blood. A metabolic crisis can occur in any person with a metabolic disorder, and they are more likely to occur after a person has gone long periods without eating or during an illness. Most people with TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias present with symptoms of a breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). This can cause kidney damage and symptoms include fatigue, muscle weakness, and having a dark color of the urine. Other symptoms of TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias include developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, hearing loss, low thyroid function (hypothyroidism) and trouble coordinating movements (ataxia). Signs and symptoms of the disease are most likely to first occur during infancy or early childhood. The disease is most common in people who are of Caucasian or Hispanic/Latino descent. TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias is caused by a genetic change (pathogenic variant) in the TANGO2 gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The disease may be suspected in people who have a metabolic crisis, episodes of rhabdomyolysis, and arrhythmias. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Spastic tetraplegia-thin corpus callosum-progressive postnatal microcephaly synd: Spastic tetraplegia-thin corpus callosum-progressive postnatal microcephaly syndrome is a rare condition that affects the brain and nervous system of newborns and infants. It is caused by a lack of an amino acid called serine in the body.
This condition is characterized by delayed development, small head size (microcephaly), intellectual disability, leg and arm muscle stiffness and tightness, and seizures. MRI brain scans also reveal  thin corpus callosum, delayed myelination, and cerebral atrophy (degeneration). Other symptoms may include overactive or abnormal reflexes, behavioral problems (such as irritability, hyperactivity, or sleep issues), abnormal hand movements, and repetitive behaviors."
"Summary of Temple syndrome: Temple syndrome is a rare genetic disease that affects growth and development. Babies and children with Temple syndrome may have trouble feeding, growth delays and hypotonia (decreased muscle tone). This disease can cause mild intellectual disability, and those affected may take longer to reach developmental milestones like crawling or walking. Temple syndrome can also cause changes in the way a child's face looks. It may cause a broad forehead, a short nose with a wide tip, downturned mouth corners, high-arched palate, and a small jaw. Other symptoms of Temple syndrome can include gaining weight easily as a child, starting puberty early, slender and long bones, and having small hands and feet."

"Summary of Plasmacytoma: Plasmacytoma is a type of cancer that begins in plasma cells (white blood cells that produce antibodies). It presents as a localized mass of abnormal plasma cells and makes up about 5% of all plasma cell cancers. There are two types of plasmacytoma: primary plasmacytoma of the bone and extramedullary plasmacytoma of the soft tissues.
Extramedullary plasmacytomas usually occur in the head and neck, especially in the upper respiratory tract. They are more common in men than women, and are usually diagnosed around age 50."
"Summary of PENS syndrome: PENS syndrome is a very rare type of keratinocytic epidermal nevi that includes a specific type of skin lesion and can be associated with other birth defects and neurological problems. The skin lesions appear as small, slightly scaly, pimples (papules) made of the thickened outer layer of the skin (hyperkerotosis) with a rough, flat surface. The skin lesions may be visible at birth or soon after birth. There may be one lesion or multiple lesions anywhere on the body. The color of the skin lesions varies from white to brown and the shape may vary as well. Neurological symptoms, such as mild intellectual disability, seizures, and delayed development of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor delay), are present in about 50% of the cases. Psychomotor delay may appear as clumsiness or difficulty playing sports. Deafness, unusual facial features, and genital birth defects, such as hypospadius or a curved penis, have been described in a few cases. The diagnosis of PENS may be confirmed by a biopsy of the skin lesion and/or examination of the skin lesion and surrounding skin under a special microscope (dermoscopy). When there are four or more skin lesions, examination for neurological symptoms may be suggested. The cause of the PENS is not known, but there are several cases where more than one member of a family is affected."
"Summary of Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis: Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis (KLA) is a rare type of tumor and vascular malformation that results from the abnormal development of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is part of the immune system made up of vessels that help to protect the body from infection and foreign substances. KLA involves multiple parts of the body, especially the lungs and chest. Symptoms of KLA usually start during childhood, and include shortness of breath (dyspnea) and cough due to the accumulation of fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion) and heart (pericardial effusion). Other common symptoms include chest and body pain, abnormal bleeding and bruising, and soft masses under the skin. Blood collections may form under the skull (epidural hematoma). The cause for KLA is unknown and it is not thought to be inherited in families. KLA is diagnosed based on the symptoms, laboratory testing, and a biopsy of tumor tissue."

"Summary of REN-related autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease: REN-related autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease is an inherited disorder that causes anemia, mildly low blood pressure, and an increased chance to develop kidney failure in childhood. In the teenage years, patients may develop a painful type of arthritis called gout. As an adult, the anemia improves but patients develop slowly progressive chronic kidney disease, which may lead to the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation between 40 and 80 years of age. REN-related autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease is caused by a mistake in one copy of the REN gene. This mistake leads to a decreased production of normal renin and the deposition of abnormal renin in kidney cells, leading to slow loss of kidney function. REN-related autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease is inherited in families in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms, family history and genetic testing."
"Summary of FTH1-related iron overload: FTH1-related iron overload (Hemochromatosis type 5) is a disease in which too much iron builds up in the body. This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. While many organs can be affected, iron overload is especially likely to affect the liver, heart, and pancreas. FTH1-related iron overload has only been reported in one family from Japan. People in this family who had the disease did not have any symptoms. However, an MRI showed increased levels of iron in the liver, heart, and bone marrow. There were also high levels of iron in the blood. FTH1-related iron overload is caused by genetic changes (genetic changes or pathogenic variants) to the FTH1 gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because FTH1-related iron overload is so rare, the disease may not be suspected until signs are seen on an MRI, liver biopsy, or a blood test. The diagnosis may be confirmed with genetic testing."
"Summary of Intellectual disability-epilepsy-extrapyramidal syndrome: Intellectual disability-epilepsy-extrapyramidal syndrome (DEAF1-related disorder) is a neurologic disease that mainly presents with intellectual disability, speech impairment and motor developmental delay. Additional features that have being described include seizures, brain malformations, behavioral problems, autism, stomach and/or intestinal problems, and skeletal problems (flat foot or hip dislocation). Some people with Intellectual disability-epilepsy-extrapyramidal syndrome may also have some features that resemble another disease known as Smith-Magenis syndrome, such as intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and sleep disturbances.. Intellectual disability-epilepsy-extrapyramidal syndrome is caused by changes (known as pathogenic variants,s) in the DEAF1 gene which activates or represses several other genes that are important for brain cell (neuron) development."

"Summary of Combined immunodeficiency with granulomatosis: Combined immunodeficiency with granulomatosis is characterized by recurrent viral infections and the presence of granulomas in the skin, mucous membranes and/or internal organs. There is a gradual reduction in the number and function of B cells (a type of white blood cell that makes antibodies), and T lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell, that protect the body from infection attacking the infected cells directly), hypogammaglobulinemia (reduction in all types of gamma globulins, including antibodies that help fight infection.) and defective autoinmunity where the immune system attacks the body itself. Some people may develop associated auto-immune diseases such as myasthenia gravis, vitiligo, low blood red and white cells, psoriasis, and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. It is caused by genetic changes in the RAG1 and/or RAG2 genes. These genes provide instructions for making a member of a group of proteins called the RAG complex, which is involved in the process, known as V(D)J recombination, needed for maintaining the diversity of the B and T cells so they can be able to recognize diverse foreign agents allowing the body to fight infections. The genetic changes can impair RAG complex formation and function, resulting in an impaired B and T cells' function. Depending on the residual activity of the RAG proteins the disease can be more or less severe. In less severe cases symptoms are milder and may appear later in life."

"Summary of Subcorneal pustular dermatosis: Subcorneal pustular dermatosis (SPD) is a rare skin disease in which pus-filled pimples or blisters (pustules) form under the top (subcorneal) layer of the skin. It is most common in middle-aged adults (particularly women) but can develop in children. Pustules usually appear over a few hours and grow together to form round or wavy patterns. They most often form in areas where the skin may touch or rub together, such as the groin area, underarms, inside the elbows, and behind the knees. The pustules may be mildly itchy or painful, but despite being pus filled, are not infected. The diagnosis of SPD is made based on the appearance of the pustules and the results of a skin biopsy (histologic findings). The cause of SPD is not known. There is currently no evidence it is inherited (no familial cases have been reported) and it is not contagious. SPD may be associated with other diseases or health problems including several autoimmune diseases, blood (hematologic) diseases, infections, and cancers. Rarely, it has been associated with taking certain medications (drug-induced SPD)."

"Summary of Seizures, benign familial neonatal, 2: Benign familial neonatal seizures 2 is a rare genetic condition. It is characterized by unprovoked seizures in the first few days or months of life. These seizures can be clonic or tonic-clonic. They typically last for about a minute and may occur several times a day. The seizures are usually responsive to medication. Almost all patients have full remission within the first months of life. In some rare cases, a few seizures may occur later in childhood. Tests for the brain's electrical activity, brain structure, and development are usually normal. Seizures, benign familial neonatal, 2 is caused by changes in the KCNQ3 gene. This condition follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder."
"Summary of Cutis laxa, autosomal dominant 1: Autosomal dominant cutis laxa 1 (ADCL1) is a rare genetic connective tissue disease. It is characterized by loose and wrinkled skin that creates a prematurely aged appearance. The face, hands, feet, joints, and torso may be affected to varying degrees. The skin lacks elastic recoil. Elastic recoil is the ability to return to its normal state after being stretched. This is usually due to loss, fragmentation, or severe disorganization of the elastic fibers in the skin. ADCL1 can cause distinctive facial appearance that becomes more pronounced with age. Other symptoms may include gastrointestinal problems, hernias, and in rare cases, heart and lung problems. ADCL1 is caused by mutations in the ELN gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder."

In some cases, the symptoms can be more severe and may appear in childhood. HSAN1A is caused by mutations in the SPTLC1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder."
"Summary of Optic atrophy 1: Optic atrophy 1 is a genetic condition that affects the eyes. It typically starts causing vision problems in early childhood. This leads to moderate to severe loss of vision, problems with seeing colors, changes in the optic nerve, and blind spots. Some people with this condition may also experience other neurological symptoms. Symptoms include deafness and weakness of the eye muscles. This condition can also cause muscle cramps, overactive reflex responses, and poor muscle control. Optic atrophy 1 is caused by changes in a gene called OPA1 which is important for the health of the cells in the eye. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder."
"Summary of Abetalipoproteinemia: Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) is a genetic condition. It leads to low levels of cholesterol and difficulties in absorbing fat-soluble vitamins. Infants with this condition usually present with vomiting and diarrhea. They also usually show failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate. Older people with the condition can develop irregularities with the blood and retinal degeneration. They may also have liver problems, and progressive neuromuscular symptoms. Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by mutations in the MTTP gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means two copies of the mutated gene are required to cause the disease."
"Summary of Pituitary hormone deficiency, combined, 2: Combined pituitary hormone deficiency 2 (CPHD2) is a rare genetic condition. It is caused by mutations in the PROP1 gene. People with this condition have less growth hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone. They also have less luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin. This is because lower amounts of each of these hormones are being secreted by the pituitary gland. Occasionally, adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion is also reduced. Newborns with CPHD2 typically do not show signs of hormone deficiency at birth. That is unlike other forms of congenital pituitary hormone deficiency. Birth weight and length are generally unaffected. Hypoglycemia and jaundice are not common findings. Shortly after birth, thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiencies may appear. Growth hormone deficiency may lead to a child being shorter than their peers. LH and FSH deficiencies can lead to disruptions in puberty and fertility. For example, untreated males may have a small penis and testes. Females may need hormone therapy after starting their periods. CPHD2 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that two copies of the mutated gene are required to cause the disease."
"Summary of Chromosome xq28 duplication syndrome: Chromosome Xq28 duplication syndrome is a rare genetic condition. This syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, neurobehavioral differences, and atypical facial features. The severity of the symptoms varies from person to person. Cognitive impairment is typically more severe in males. Males with the syndrome may also experience a unique combination of recurrent sinus and lung infections and allergies. Those symptoms are not usually seen in affected females. Most males with the syndrome have moderate to severe intellectual disability. Females may have milder intellectual symptoms or are unaffected. The syndrome is caused by the duplication of a specific region on the X chromosome. It is inherited in an X-linked pattern. Most individuals inherit the duplication from their mother who is often symptom-free. Some cases of new (de novo) duplications have been identified."
"Summary of Frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 7: Frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 7 (FTDALS7) is a rare, inherited brain disorder. It that typically affects adults. People with FTDALS7 may experience amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) symptoms. Or, they may experience frontotemporal dementia (FTD) symptoms. ALS symptoms include muscle loss and weakness of the upper and lower limbs, difficulty swallowing, and breathing problems. FTD symptoms involve changes in behavior and personality, memory loss, cognitive decline, and disinhibition, the inability to control oneâs emotions or actions.

"Summary of Deafness, autosomal dominant 2a: Autosomal dominant deafness 2A (DFNA2A) is a genetic condition that affects hearing. It is characterized by high-frequency hearing loss. This means high-pitched sounds are harder to hear. Over time, the condition causes loss of hearing across all frequencies (low- and high-pitched sounds). The impairment is often detected during routine hearing assessments of children. But, it is likely present from birth. Older people experience moderate hearing loss in lower frequencies. They also experience severe hearing loss in high frequencies. Most individuals with DFNA2A will need hearing aids between the ages of 10 and 40. By the age of 70, they typically have severe to profound hearing impairment. DFNA2A is caused by a mutation in the KCNQ4 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder."
"Summary of Epilepsy, familial focal, with variable foci 1: Familial focal epilepsy with variable foci 1 (FFEVF1) is a type of epilepsy that runs in families. This form of epilepsy causes seizures that start in different parts of the brain. People with FFEVF1 often have auras or automatisms during seizures, meaning they may have subjective sensations and experiences or display involuntary repetitive movements. Others have seizures during sleep. Seizures often begin in one area of the brain and spread to other areas. Some people with this condition have abnormal brain waves, intellectual disability, or autism spectrum disorders. Seizures usually start in the first or second decades of life, but they can also occur later. Not everyone in a family with FFEVF1 will have the same symptoms. Some patients have been found to have subtle or clear signs of differences in the cells or structures of the area of the brain known as the cortex. These differences are called focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). FFEVF1 is caused by mutations in the DEPDC5 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder."
Summary of Mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 2 (myopathic type): Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 2 (myopathic type) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the muscles. It is characterized by muscle weakness that usually starts in childhood. People with this syndrome have a decreased amount of mitochondrial DNA in the skeletal muscles. The severity of the condition can vary greatly. Some patients experience symptoms starting in infancy. These patients may experience rapid progression and early death due to respiratory failure. Others have a slower progression and onset of symptoms later in childhood. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the TK2 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means two copies of the mutated gene are required to cause the disease.
"Summary of Frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 1: Frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 1 (FTDALS1) is a rare neurodegenerative disease. It is caused by changes in the C9ORF72 gene. It can be characterized by frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It can be characterized by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Or, it can be characterized by a combination of the two. Atypical presentations may also occur. The symptoms of FTD may include progressive changes in personality and behavior. This can include changes in judgement. People with FTDALS1 may have trouble managing thoughts, emotions, and actions. The condition can also cause difficulty communicating. This specific type of FTD also includes neuropsychiatric symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. The symptoms of ALS are mainly related to motor neurons. These include abnormal muscle tone, involuntary rapid muscle twitches, muscle cramps, and trouble walking. Problems with swallowing, speech, and early cognitive impairments can also occur. Symptoms appear during adulthood and may vary significantly between and within families. This causes an unpredictable pattern and age of onset of symptoms. Those with ALS typically present earlier and have more severe symptoms. FTDALS1 is caused by specific changes called hexanucleotide repeat expansions. These expansions occur in the C9ORF72 gene. Hexanucleotide repeats are repeats of 6 specific nucleotides, the basic building blocks of DNA and RNA. When they expand, they increase in size from one generation to the next. Most people have between 2 and 19 repeats. People with FTDALS1 have 250 to over 2,000. Symptoms may occur in people with as few as 20 to 22 repeats. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means most people with this condition inherited the repeat expansion from one of their parents."
"Summary of Chromosome xq26.3 duplication syndrome: Chromosome Xq26.3 duplication syndrome is a type of X-linked acrogigantism (XLAG). It is caused by extra genetic material on the X chromosome. This condition is characterized by excessive growth. Overgrowth usually begins during the first year of life in previously normal infants. This overgrowth is caused by the overproduction of growth hormone (GH1). The overproduction is due to pituitary hyperplasia. Pituitary hyperplasia is underdevelopment of the pituitary, and/or a pituitary macroadenoma. Pituitary macroadenoma is is a type of usually benign tumor. Chromosome Xq26.3 duplication syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. Most cases represent a single occurrence in a family."

This type of Parkinson disease is very similar to the more common form of the disease. It is characterized by shaking, slowness of movement, stiffness, and problems with balance. These symptoms tend to be milder. They also present about ten years earlier than those seen in the common form of Parkinson disease. Other symptoms that may occur include problems with thinking and memory, mood changes. PD17 can cause difficulties with the sense of smell and with the body's automatic functions like blood pressure and digestion. PD17 is caused by mutations in the VPS35 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder."
"Summary of Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 42: Autosomal dominant intellectual developmental disorder 42 (MRD42) is a genetic neurological condition. People with this disorder experience global developmental delay. This means they have trouble learning new things and developing skills at the same pace as others their age. They also have impaired intellectual development. This can make it difficult for them to learn and function in daily life. Other symptoms include low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, and poor overall growth. Symptoms can also include crossed eyes (strabismus), reduced vision, and autistic traits. MRD42 is caused by mutations in the GNB1 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases occur for the first time in a family as the result of a new (de novo) mutation."
"Summary of Intellectual developmental disorder with seizures and language delay: Intellectual developmental disorder with seizures and language delay (IDDSELD) is a genetic neurological condition. It is characterized by delays in intellectual and language development during early childhood. It also causes seizures, which are variable in onset and type. People with IDDSELD may also have behavioral differences. Differences include hyperactivity, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Additionally, some individuals may have different facial features, crossed eyes, or feeding difficulties. IDDSELD is caused by mutations in the SETD1B gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases occur for the first time in a family as the result of a new (de novo) mutation."
"Summary of Neurodevelopmental disorder with dysmorphic facies and variable seizures: Neurodevelopmental disorder with dysmorphic facies and variable seizures (NEDDFAS) is a rare genetic neurological condition. It is characterized by global developmental delay and intellectual disability. These symptoms begin in early childhood for people with NEDDFAS. People with this condition may also have seizures and speech delays. NEDDFAS can also cause atypical facial features, and differences in behavior. Additional findings may include mild differences in a personâs bones and kidneys. NEDDFAS is caused by mutations in the EMC10 gene. It is inherited in inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that two copies of the mutated gene are required to cause the disease."
"Summary of Melanoma, cutaneous malignant, susceptibility to, 10: Susceptibility to cutaneous malignant melanoma 10 (CMM10) is a genetic condition. This condition is characterized by an increased risk of developing various benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) tumors. This includes a type of skin cancer called melanoma. The risk of developing these tumors increases as a person gets older. While tumors typically appear in adulthood, they can sometimes develop during childhood. The types of tumors can affect different parts of the body. This includes the skin, connective tissue, nerves, and blood. Additionally, this condition is characterized by having cells that live longer than usual. This may cause the cells to accumulate changes that potentially lead to cancer. CMM10 is caused by a mutation to the POT1 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. Not everyone who inherits the mutated POT1 gene will develop symptoms."
"Summary of Parkinson disease 6, autosomal recessive early-onset: Autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson disease 6 is a genetic condition caused by changes in the PINK1 gene. This condition frequently presents in the early-to-mid-30s. It is characterized by slowly progressive symptoms. These include tremors, slow movement, muscle stiffness, and muscle contractions. Most symptoms are very similar to those seen in other forms of Parkinson's disease. For some people, this condition affects posture, reflexes, behavior, and mental health.

"Summary of Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin-intellectual disability syndrome: Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin-intellectual disability syndrome is a genetic condition present from birth. This syndrome is characterized by slow development of physical and mental skills. This includes affects on walking and coordination. People with this condition may have intellectual disability. They may also have a continued presence of fetal hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells. Fetal hemoglobin is the main type of hemoglobin that carries oxygen around the body of a developing fetus. It usually disappears in the months after birth. The continued presence of the fetal hemoglobin itself does not cause any symptoms. People with this particular syndrome may have a variety of atypical facial features. These can include a smaller than usual head size, downward slanting eyes, eyes that don't seem to align (strabismus). Features can also include ears that have an atypical shape or structure. This condition is caused by a mutation in the BCL11A gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most people with this syndrome have it because of a new mutation (de novo)."
"Summary of Deafness, autosomal recessive 9: Autosomal recessive deafness 9, also known as DFNB9, is a genetic condition that affects hearing. It is caused by mutations in the otoferlin (OTOF) gene. This condition has two main forms. The first is known as prelingual non-syndromic auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD). In the ANSD form, individuals are born with severe-to-profound deafness. They do not have inner-ear abnormalities. ANSD deafness is not usually detected by standard newborn hearing screening. The other form is known as temperature-sensitive auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (TS-ANSD). Individuals with TS-ANSD typically have normal-to-moderate hearing loss at normal body temperatures. For these people, a slight increase in body temperature can trigger a significant, temporary worsening of hearing. DFNB9 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that two copies of the mutated gene are required to cause the disease."
