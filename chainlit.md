# RGD Chatbot

Hi! I'm a chatbot designed to help you stay informed about the latest findings in rare genetic diseases. I can access and understand research articles from PubMed, a large database of scientific publications.

Feel free to ask me anything about rare genetic diseases, and I'll do my best to find you the most relevant and up-to-date information.
